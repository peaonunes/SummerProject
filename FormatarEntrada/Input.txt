0,654,0,650,There has been an enormous amount of positive local feedback - from a cross-section of local communities. In one sense, the &#039;stock&#039; of the Met has never been higher.<br />Stockwell was a significant set-back - but, for the most part, people have reacted in a reasonably balanced way and are genuinely appreciative of all that the Met is doing.<br />Effective communication and the flow of accurate information are critically important.

0,665,0,650,Retaining community confidence requires information that can be rapidly transmitted to them on a borough. Information provided to boroughs that could be communicated was very slow in coming. The MPS need to provide a press bulletin for release to Boroughs<br />with even the most limited factual information within 60 minutes of an incident. Otherwise the 24 hour news channels will deliver their interpretation of the in incident and possibly damage community confidence. This message should be E mailed to SPOC&#039;s on Borough&#039;s for coordination and dissemination.

0,670,0,662,Additional HVP at rail/underground/bus stations adds to community reassurance but also raises concern from some aspects of the community over any real value of the tactic ie what difference does it actually make to prevention/detection, whats the impact on priority crime due to resource abstraction from core policing etc

0,679,0,651,Lessons learned through allocation of FLO&#039;s at the earliest opportunity has contributed to positive support of bereaved families and not forgetting those injured.
0,680,0,662,The one size fits all approach to the Thursday 21st rail station operation was inappropriate and caused some raised fears in our communities. At some of the quieter stations the sight of a seven police officers caused some commuters to turn right around and go home as they thought a major incident had occurred. BOCUs should be left to make local operational decisons. If we had been told exactly what the purpose of the operation was we could have planned tactics to deliver it.
0,681,0,650,Timely and relevant information was required in a format that could be sent electronically to partners and community contacts. Other than press releases and transcripts other information had to be sanitised.
0,682,0,653,Personal visits to the local Mosque and Islamic Centre have been greatly appreciated - and have resulted in the development of some enormously positive local relationships.<br />Two &#039;Good Practice&#039; examples:<br />(1) 9th July - SMT visit to Islmic Centre following early evening prayers. Formal Q&amp;A session with local community members - with positive outcomes.<br />(2) 22nd July - Visit by female officers and staff (with interpreter) to Islamic Centre for Workshop with Moslem women. Once again, very positive feedback received.
0,683,0,662,There has been real concern about the duplication of effort in relation to deploying resources in central london. even some time after the incidents the coordination between central london BOCUs and CO11 has not been evident. Control  of resources should have a central focus.
0,684,0,655,The advent of 24 hour news channels and live interviews requires a different response from police. There needs to be a Police spokesperson accessing live broadcasts facilities even when full facts are not known. This will increase the risk of making a mistake by responding to current available information but allows access to a very wide population where even standard police appeals, contact numbers etc could be issued. It does not hyave to be a question and answer session as a matter of course.This will begin the process of getting a police message across and community reassurance messages at an early stage. Stilted interviews can damage the MPS image and a &#039;CADRE&#039; of spokepersons would be required and available.
0,685,0,650,To date there has been a general decrease in reported racial incidents.  HVP patrols and visits to places of worship across the board has impacted in a positive manner.  Ensuring that clear and accurate information, prepared quick time for disemmination to the local community must be of paramount importance.
0,686,0,650,There is little doubt that the general public have understood and supported what the MPS have and are trying to achieve. Many Boroughs have established mechanisms in place for responding when community contact and interaction is required. I do however believe that we must review the basis upon which IAG&#039;s assist. My feeling is that we should lok to establish a body beyond their remit which will include all stakeholders and in particular Local Authorities.
0,687,0,650,Our local cross faith support to the wider Muslim community has been very positive. Most residents recognise the extremists involved do not represent the Muslim majority in any way. The leaders of our local Muslim community have been very positive in recognising the need to do more and to engage more with their youth who may be radicalised if exposed to extreme views.
0,688,0,662,as a central london BOCU our ability to coordinate our response could have been more steamlined re clarity of contingency plans and availability of personnel
0,689,0,685,You can respond to comments by just clicking on them and conversation will unfold
0,690,0,662,Of necessity, my borough has had to take a &quot;pragmatic approach&quot; and introduce a grading based on a risk assessment of our quieter stations.  Also  at the busier stations officers are falling over BTP.  There appears to be no co-ordination.
0,691,0,650,I think that we must develop a SOP for the organisation in coping with the issues arising from such events. We have been plagued with central requests for things that on Borough I beleive we take for granted as part of our relationship with local people.
0,692,0,650,There have been intial concerns that the BOCU was not passing on all the available information, that seems to be improving with the circulation albeit limited of the Diamond briefing. We would like to circulate that briefing to all community leaders/partners but as yet it is not being sent to Police.
0,693,0,650,Need for effective respone to allegations of Hate Crime.<br />Positive Example: On the evening of July 7th, a male was arrested in SW London for Racially Aggravated Criminal Damage and Common Assault. The incident took place in a small, Moslem-run supermarket - and was directly linked to the bombings that morning. The suspect was detained in police custody overnight and dealt with by the CSU the following morning. Charged and to court in custody. The court also remanded him in custody and he subsequently pleaded guilty. This sent a very strong - and extremely positive - message to the community, one that was very well received.
0,694,0,650,Community tension levels have remained consistently low on my borough. Regular community briefings shared with the Local Authority have taken place. The recent arrests have broadened the effected community to include Somali. Many positives arising out of this enhanced community contact with many groups gaining a better understanding of policing, especially stop and search.  Stop and search tactics are under scrutiniy from monitoring organisation, CRE in particular and it would help if the centre provide a lead on tactics to be used. Media have raised the issue of &#039;racial profiling&#039;.  Concern has been raised that all Asians could be seen as suspects regardless of faith.
0,695,0,652,A corporate approach to hospital casualty co-ordination linking in with LAS to identify which hospitals needed staff deployment and then early guidance on evidential forensic requirements.  Local Scenes of crime officers were seeking deployment.
0,696,0,650,It is interesting that apart from the Jewish community who historically have taken their security very seriously most other places of worship do not have a great knowledge of what they can do to secure their environments. This came from my Gold Group and has now been addressed.
0,697,0,653,Whilst we think that community condfidence in us is high I was surprised at how fragile I found it e.g. After a racial assualt on a Muslim Outreach Group I had a meeting with them to plan for the future. The power of senior officers showing committment to their safety was clear from their reaction but  disappointingly they had anticipated that after the report of crime that they would hear no more from us.
0,698,0,655,At BOCU level, greater contact with our DPA reps would have been useful, particularly in communcating local messages.
0,699,0,650,Introduction of a Faith Liaison officer 18 months ago has paid significant dividends for us. At the ealiest opportunity who were able to engage with influential leaders to provide information and seek assistance in spreading messages and encouraging Community Intelligence.
0,700,0,652,There have been several &#039;sightings&#039; of terrost suspects during the preceeding weeks albiet one or more have been in custody.  To ensure a positive public assurance each incident has been given a critical response to the investigation and capturing of potential evidence.  Such positive responses must remain in place.
0,701,0,653,Dedicated Community Engagement Teams involved in 24/7 personal visits to Mosques and Synagogues, offering reassurance and establishing individual policing needs welcomed by community, and in response to subsequent requests additional policing provided around prayer times.
0,702,0,680,I echo this comment completely. I have been told that CO11 wanted the postings to stations to be a surprise. I had hoped it was based on intelligence. Borough Commanders are best placed to decide on the appropriate strengths to stations but should be made aware of any intelligence/thrat to perticular lines/areas.
0,703,0,668,as a large borough on diverse sites, implementing an effective command structure was challenging in the short term, particularly around gold, silver and numerous bronzes. more detailed contingency palns are required to ensure absolute clarity and speed of response.
0,704,0,662,We have a range of stations from half hourly branch line/feeder services to Surbiton which has a very large throughput of trains. We also border Surrey where it would seem that the response is different, it is confusing our residents and staff. Are there plans to grade our response centrally or to give BOCUs that option. We appreciate the need for morning cover to reassure people travelling in to London but being on the outskirts question the need for the same resources when they are coming home.
0,705,0,662,I am confident that my SMT know our Borough better than anyone. I am somewhat disheartened by the approach taken in relation to resourcing that tends to throw a blanket over the MPS and treat everyone the same. Response to such incidents, particularly the 21st, needs to be reconsidered. Local knowledge becomes vital when determining staffing. This seems to be forgotten when it gets into the more snior roles in the MPS
0,706,0,650,There have been increasing concerns raised that excessive HVP is causing concern rather than reassurance. Whilst much of the focus has been at transport nodes and places of worship for the Muslim community, a debrief from all the Gold Groups from each Borough  may provide guidance for future deployments. Was the HVP there to prevent further attacks or to reassure is a question being asked? This could require two different types of policing tactics and approaches. The issue of &#039;credible intelligence&#039; covers many things and there is no feedback once any time scale for &#039;credible intelligence&#039; has passed. Whilst there is never a need to know the source or what direct intelligence actually was, I am concerned that such continued use of such wording may result in apathy with officers and alienation of the community.
0,707,0,650,The London Week of Peace (11th-18th September) represents a significant opportunity to turn the positive engagement of the last few weeks into local, Borough-based action. Members of our local Gold Group have now volunteered to assist in a Peace Week planning process. There is a significant desire across local faith groups and communities to turn the experience of recent times into something positive and sustainable.
0,708,0,680,As a small borough in the middle of AL we would not have coped with demand without the use of SN teams pan borough. Local SN communities have understood this but there is a question of how long we can do this.<br />Also raises the question of the limited powers of PCSO&#039;s especially when not under the direction of a PC. This limits their deployment especially when stop and search may be warranted.
0,709,0,668,under service mobilisation we need to be more effective about the mobilisation of BOCU CID in particular and other specialist resources. eg FLOs. Bocus were receiving ad hoc requests with little notice and central coordination is required.
0,710,0,651,Funerals, we were not informed of a funeral of a victim and found out through the Church one or two days before the event. Is it part of the FLO role to link in with local BOCUs?
0,711,0,651,Early communication with Local Authorities needs to be considered to avoid cases where burials are reported in press and relevant Local Authority is unaware. Whilst family wishes are paramount, this should not prevent dialog with LAs.
0,712,0,655,Our internal updates re events ws overtaken by the 24 media. However, we were too involved to watch the TV! Our community sometimes knew more than we did.<br />On a different level when we held our Community Gold Group the people involved had not seen the full news and statements made by ACPO etc. Therefore for the future they requested that transcripts of such press statements be made available immediately on AWARE so that we could publish them for our own Community Gold Group. This would allow a more informed debate and exchange.
0,713,0,653,The early information enabled a rapid response to the North London Mosque and Muslim Welfare House.  This allowed early consultation and involvement of the trustees on the police response and support to them. They are actively involved in any decision making and as a result community confidence and reassurance levels are high.  Corporate community tension indicators informed the Borough of the wider picture allowing us to determine local needs.<br />A good faith prayer meeting was planned outside the Mosque which we assisted in enabling to take place at the Town Hall, reducing the media interset in the mosque, a key factor for both the community and police.
0,714,0,650,See media re information to Community Gold groups
0,715,0,652,In most major incidents within many potential witnesses if details are not obtained promptly we&#039;lose&#039; witnesses who leave the scene. Sometimes they do not realise the importance of what they can add. From watching early media coverage of the events you could see many people leaving the scenes. This coverage can assist to identify people later. A postive step for the MPS could be to get our own cameras there asap and record images of all leaving the scene and potentially their names and addresses. The feasibility is greater for the larger events with most potential witnesses.
0,716,0,662,My Borough also has  considerable through traffic of both LT and BR with feeder lines between stations.  The provision of early reassurance patrols at the stations is necessary however, the massive abstractions to central London with a low BWT has an impact throughout the day.  Borough Commanders should be given leeway to prioritise the evening posts.
0,717,0,0,Facilitator Comments from Jonathan Crego
0,718,0,662,is is always helpful to remind officers and PCSOs of all the powers available to them, including those those under common law.
0,719,0,717,Please feel free to click on your colleagues comments to effectively comment on their comments.  You do this by clicking on their comments and adding your feelings
0,720,0,669,A phrase has developed at OCU level of &#039;void filling&#039;. The perception is that various depts at NSY and ESB feel impotent to deal and therefore demand information to fill their void.<br />Often requests have been made with little or no explanation of why the information is required.<br />Confidence is lessened when a subsequent phone call explains that many of the people demanding this information are &#039;too busy to read it&#039;.<br />Also the depts have duplicated requests.
0,721,0,696,Also an issue on our borough. The Muslim community have been encouraged to supply their own security to supplement/support police actions. Significant reluctance in this area, possibly requires a strong message from Muslim Community/Faith leaders to support such an initiative in both the short and long term.
0,722,0,719,Also please look at the other themes
0,723,0,668,I have been very dissappointed with the information flow. I found that I was trying to second guess what was going on and got most of my information from Sky news - some of which proved to be unreliable e.g eye witnesses categorically saying that the Stockwell shooting wictim was a suicide bomber because they had seen a bomb belt and dangling wires. Appreciating that it was a very fast moving scenario and that any strategic assessment would have been out of date as soon as it was published we do need a system that provides that sort of assessment in a timely way.
0,724,0,702,The surprise element referred too is totally inappropriate. Information and intelligence are at the heart of all that we should be doing. Not just with these events but all policing. Putting police officers at stations and other transport networks is re-assuring but we can only do that for so long before it becomes recognised as a tactic and its value reduces. Boroughs must have the lead on developing, with their communities, the security measures required which will be particular to an area albeit there will be crossovers.
0,725,0,705,The importance of local knowledge must not be underestimated - or undermined. In general terms, local officers &amp; staff do know best. I agree that the &#039;one size fits all&#039; approach is limited and takes no account of local variations (particularly at a time when many of our staff are very, very tired).<br />Local police commanders need to be given the capacity to respond appropriately to the needs of their local communities.<br />The same principle applies to the idea of communication. Messages from the Centre direct to local community members are not helpful (and might actually do more harm that good). Local communication with local people is infinitely preferable. Timely and accurate informations to Borough SPOCs is the best way for the MPS to communicate with local communities.
0,726,0,650,Many of the comments have already been included in the remarks of others. The fact that we had a community meeting on the 7th July and a number since has increased confidence. Additionally we are holding seperate meetings with those communities who were not willing to talk in front of others- a meeting with the Muslim leaders and we have held one and another next week for the Somali Community. It has been reassuring that the Somali youth have made contact to hold a meeting. This has been gratefully received as it is one of our hard to reach groups. We have good relations with the elders and less so with the young.<br />Agree that need fast time messages, need to trust the community more with information. I got most of mine from the TV!<br />Our community Leaders and Faith Leaders are very positive about the MPS and Police Response.<br />I was impressed that the MPS Boroughs could deal so effectively and quickly with the issues.<br />Enhanced Hate Crime response effective, by using Q cars to immediately respond with CSU back up and the local authority agreed to remove any Graffiti in two hours
0,727,0,653,For sometime prior to 7/7 we had dome hawk cameras sited at our Mosques to prevent criminal damage and other ASB. This small step amongst many has been received well as a postive and visible activity in support of a regular uniform presence.
0,728,0,669,Continuous demand from TPHQ/Emerald/Safer Neighbourhoods for returns on templates ranging from Policing Plan to levels of abstraction is frustrating can we please put some initiatives on hold until say September.
0,729,0,655,Instead of allowing people who have been retired for 15 years to speculate on what we are doing can we not put up someone to go to these 24 hr news stations and hold our line? Speculation has become the most dangerous issue in community tensions, we need a free press, but we now seem to work with an irresponsible one.
0,730,0,650,
0,731,0,661,What is this subject about? What do you want?
0,732,0,662,Feedback from officers from this Borough on aid yesterday to central London indicated how much an overkill in relation to deployments, without giving the name of the serials away, one officer quoted we could have surrounded Charing Cross staion holding hands  and had an inner and an outer cordon. Is the best use of resources? Or are we leaving vulnerable communities exposed on &#039;Home&#039; Boroughs where perhaps the reassurance activity and prevention/investigation of racist incidents which add to fear of crime could be addressed?
0,733,0,650,The local Muslim community remain pleased with police action overall. They were initially concerned about the level of reassurance that would be provided. ie too much and there would be added concerns from their community that we felt that there was a specific threat to them or that we were suspicious. They wanted to see their own cops from Safer Neighbourhoods or community teams. As far as possible this has been our policy and it has proven very effective.
0,734,0,717,Probably nothing you can do but I am beginning to get slightly annoyed when I try to read other comments and the screen disappears and I have to scroll down to find the comment again only for it to vanish after another few words have been read.....
0,735,0,650,Provision of  faith/race/hate crime response vehicle assisted community reassurance
0,736,0,650,we need to make sure that we dont lose sight of the non muslim and non religious sections of the community. Fear needs to be allayed across the board.
0,737,0,734,this is a work in progress, please stick with it, next time it will not happen but I did not want to miss the opportunity of using it at this time
0,738,0,737,I have slowed the screen refresh hope that helps
0,739,0,655,There media appetite for information in relation to the events of the 7th and 21st was endless. At the site of the Shepherds Bush failed explosion, we were very clear that the only formal Press Statements were to come from the Yard. However, that is of limited assitance when there are 100+ media people at the cordon - all desperate for anything you can give them. It would be helpful to have some form of middle ground - where local media bronzes are able to engage with the press at a very simple and superficial level - conforming a handful of non-contentious facts and putting a human face of the local police response. APPOs would be able to assist with this.
0,740,0,650,Our multi-faith forum proved a valuable tool to use at it reached a wider range of groups that just the Muslim community. This was important so that we didn&#039;t appear to be focusing on and drawing more attention to the Muslim community. It reinforced the Londoners as a whole were the victims message.
0,741,0,731,what other communities are effected, LGB, etc
0,742,0,655,At the initial stages of both incidents it was somewhat disappointing to be updated by Sky then have the same update issued to Boroughs up to an hour later.  Quick time intelligence and requirements must be fed to boroughs in a more efficient manner.
0,743,0,661,All Faith groups were pleased to receive visits from officers to provide re-assurance and first hand advice and progress reports. Some groups were surprised that they received such visits as they had not expected them and they were something, that has not hapened o/s of specific groups in the past i.e. to the Muslim Community or the Jewish community. They initial had not perceived it as their problem. However, as seen from the diversity of race, religion and nationality of the victims of 7/7 no community is immune or spared by random , indiscriminate attacks. This has opened some eyes and increased interest in security and close contact with the local officers. A strong positive.
0,744,0,669,The MPS is a tremendous responder. On my Borough I have taken the decision to move to 12 hour days and therefore protect officers rest days as far as I can within current resourcing requirements. I have always been opposed to anything other than 8 hour tours of duty for many reasons. I think that the MPS must have a shift system that allows it to manage. There are a multitude of patterns about all in the name of flexibility but I am sure that in times of crisis they must be difficult. I think an interesting discussion could be had on availabilty.
0,745,0,737,If you want to read a long comment click on it and it will appear on the left and remain until you click on another
0,746,0,654,The Jewish community remain concerned but reassured that their security is being taken seriously. As mentioned in an earlier comment they are equipped through the CST to deal with these issues but not in all parts of the Jewish community. That said, liaison with CST, local groups and police remains excellent on this Borough.
0,747,0,668,The Command Strucuture from centre not always clear-need update of who is doing what on each day. Multiple requests for the same commmunity tensions/info to be sent in different formats to different people. Twice a day would have been enough rather than three times daily.<br />Our Gold Group looked at the issue of Two Silvers- one for out on the ground, other for resourcing and co-ordinating from CAD room. Although I was comfortable with it, there was some disquiet around clarity for everyone so reverted to one silver.<br />We have multiple sites and I sent out daily messages to all staff on email. This was not an effective way to do it. Metbats may be better, or could we put messages directly on the screen saver. Need to have better method of communicating to multiple sites.
0,748,0,668,Please do not prescribe who or what rank Bronze should be for local deployment. As a small BOCU with two Chief Inspectors/Two Superintending Ranks we find it difficult to field say a Chief Inspector as Bronze or to supply even one inspector as a matter of course. Some directions have been each BOCU will provide Bronze Community, Bronze Operation Sevarus, and support to the centre.  The traditonal structure of 1 - 2 - 20 for public order should not be a one size fits all solution.
0,749,0,728,I agree. The demands are excessive and to be perfectly honest unwarranted. We are becoming overly beauracratic and are in danger of sinking under a tride of returns. Trust is not evident in some of what we are having to report upon.
0,750,0,668,The Borough was in a strong position due to the timing of the incidents to implement an effective local command structure.  This gave the ability to manage tasks and brief the local authority who quickly engaged with us, they suspended parking restrictions and used parking attendants to provide more support around key transport routes. At the second incident the local authority major incident room was operative within an hour.  In consideration of command structure we do need to ensure full use of our partners who are able to deal with issues such as schools, accomodation and transport.<br />In relation to information flow, most of the information initially we reacted to was from Sky News until such time the corporate confirmation came through.  The use of the front page of the web site did give an easy route for updates.  The central changing demands for information have been frustrating.  This does need to be resolved longer term.
0,751,0,669,The deployment of huge MPS resources to &#039;protect&#039; the transport infrastructure and provide reassurance has had a negative impact on the ability of Boroughs to continue &#039;business as usual&#039;. Life is different after &#039;7/7&#039;, will this be used as an opportunity for BTP and TFL to seek an increase in resources to allow  the MPS to provide the service that is desired and leave policing of the transport to the above agencies.
0,752,0,650,There has been an issue of non borough officers contacting members of the community direct. This has led to confusion as to who do they contact?
0,753,0,750,Intranet Updates have been very helpful - not least in briefing Gold Group members. More of the same would be helpful (the flow of information has slowed up this week).
0,754,0,662,The success of the MPS investigation into the attacks ha sbeen phenomenal and has made a mjor contribution to community reasurrance. We have been congratulated by large numbers of citizens and this feeling has gone a long way to restore a certain feelgood factor to London.
0,755,0,664,Staff appear afraid to use Section 44 Powers and are defaulting to Section 1 PACE
0,756,0,717,Can we slow it down any more on the really popular folders?
0,757,0,660,Risk of core business failing.
0,758,0,664,Motivating Staff at remote Stations with virtually no passengers
0,759,0,655,Would it be possible to have mobile dot matrix systems to roll out in front of the entrances to stations so that local and corporate messages can be provided and inputted by local staff in line with the current situation for that particular transport venue.
0,760,0,653,An early visit (2pm on the 7th) to the Muslim and Jewish Communities by the Borough Commander proved invaluable in providing reassurance to them. This followed by a series of visits to Mosques where different Muslim groups meet. eg Somali, Indian, Bangladeshi, Turkish, Kurdish.
0,761,0,662,The tactic of pro-active use of powers has been confusing. The BTP have actively been searching whereas our stance has been less obvious. I would have hoped for a co-ordinated response using the Op Benbow approach. This has led to confusion
0,762,0,756,Screens should only refresh every 30 seconds now
0,763,0,667,The IAG chair was involved in Gold group discussions and updated by phone.  As the local command structure was strong actions they considered had been implemented. Locally there has been little feedback from them on issues raised within the communities, this has been further evidenced by few reported incidents.
0,764,0,669,There should be greater emphasis on police automatically responding to police hospitals, particularly in the first 12 hours. This should not be left to the local CID office to respond, as they will often be overwhelmed.
0,765,0,756,unfortunately not but if you click on the item you are reading it will appear above this box and will not clear until you click on another
0,766,0,660,Motivating Staff at remote BR Stations with virtually no passengers
0,767,0,669,One of the key risks for the MPS concerns the ongoing response to priority crime. Op Theseus etc. is inevitably having a significant impact on our capacity to maintain core Borough functions (e.g. proactive crime taskings) - and there is a clear need to keep an eye on &#039;the day job&#039; (not least because of the impact that a significant rise in priority crime will have on community confidence).
0,768,0,638,Local police and partners involved in summer youth activities to monitor youth re race/faith issues as a useful barometer whilst schools are closed for summer recess and will feed pertinent information into Community Intelligence Focus desk
0,769,0,668,The use of e-mail as a medium for action has been difficult to manage. May need to re-think a SPOC for each borough in order that urgent requirements are not missed.
0,770,0,655,I found the fact that told not to speak to local press quite difficult as I do have good relationship with them. They couldn&#039;t understand why I wasn&#039;t the public face locally. I believe this was an opportunity lost. Understand the need for corporacy but we have to deal with the local  reassurance issues. Would have been helpful to have had parameters and been allowed to be the public face. Tried to overcome this by having fast time community meetings.
0,771,0,667,Use of Safer Neighbourhood Team to deal with all mosque related issues has proved invaluable
0,772,0,638,It has brought together various forums ie IAG and Inter Faith Forums.
0,773,0,660,Resilience of staff to maintain such high levels of reassurance patrols across the board.
0,774,0,669,Safer Neighbourhoods.<br />Whilst Central/Local Aid requirements are making it very difficult to do so, there is a clear desire to get SN Teams back onto their Wards. They have a key role to play in ressuring the non-commuting population - and, in the long-term they are best placed to build and maintain local community confidence (which, in turn, may also open up all sorts of intelligence opportunities and lessen the likelihood of successful attacks in the future). Management Board must remain aware of the limited capacity that exists on Boroughs - and of the impact of aid requirements on the local ability to deliver engagement, reassurance and crime reduction.
0,775,0,767,I think this is a very valid point. The longer we are required to provide resources on the current scale the more it is likely that we will be unable to recover in certain priority crime areas. In terms of resourcing what contributions are being made by those who work at CO etc. I remember the former Commissioner saying that the centre would also help with aid thereby taking some of the strain of Borough.
0,776,0,638,Enhanced understanding of mosque daily business and of the impact on people of any police activity
0,777,0,657,Use of the extended police family - we are using parks police and neighbourhood wardens to bolster our reassurance patrols. Night Club door supervisors have volunteered to wear high visibilty jackets to reassure the evening community.
0,778,0,670,The long term abstraction of staff for HVP either on or off teh borough has the potential to seriously impact on already challenging crime reduction and detection targets. Not all stations are in hotspots so the impact that could be gained by the effective deployment of local resources is lost. I already have some signs that local youth are prepared to take advantage of an absence of staff.
0,779,0,638,PCSOs have carried the brunt of the HVP patrols. The value of PCSOs within the MPS has been enhanced.
0,780,0,769,I agree, some requests were sent by e-mail to named individuals who were &quot;not at their desk&quot;.  Other requests / requirements cam via e-mail, CAD or Fax, from a variety of Depts.
0,781,0,656,Staff confidence in decision making one size does not fit all, difficult to see how current local levels can be maintained.
0,782,0,656,This demand has highlighted to amount of restricted/recoup officers who are unable to provide any credible support to this operation.<br />There needs to be a corporate review of how we allow so many officers to have such an impact on service performance. Too many times OH tie our hands by placing restrictions on officers return to work. The service need should come first followed by individual support where necessary. The current process allows the officer (and some will abuse the system) to lead the decision process.
0,783,0,662,Are CO11 taking any account of the number of tube stations etc that each Borough has when sending out the Aid requirements? My Borough - whilst relatively small in terms of officer numbers - has a minimum of 14 posts to cover.
0,784,0,773,Absolutely agree, the risk of burn out is high. PCSO&#039;s are currently being used on extended shifts but good will is waning.
0,785,0,769,This is a key area that we need to improve. E mail is a much more flexible medium than CAD but we do need to be able to access the messages via a SPOC e mail address.
0,786,0,638,In anticipated periods of demand ie Carnival all leave is cancelled are we at the stage that all leave should be cancelled until Sept 1st or are we expecting each BOCU to juggle financial matters with performance and welfare?
0,787,0,663,The fast time arrests of suspects has significantly enhanced the reputation of the Met
0,788,0,662,Locally, we have introduced a second Bomb Car - and given it specific, additional responsibilities for reporting allegations of Hate Crime. One good way of enhancing our response to vulnerable victims/communities. Our Local Authority have introduced a 24/7 Grafitti Removal service.
0,789,0,662,The criteria for deployment needs to be flexible for local needs.  Main transport links with large throughput of passengers may have guidance provided in respect of numbers of officers - this is to be determined by number of acces routes etc.  Presumably this may be available through station emergency plans - do MPS have access to these.<br />The later request to provide local reassurance action plans appeared sound, however when determining corporate demands are these considered in respect of resources.
0,790,0,660,Needs to be consideration of impact on sporting events, e.g. football season, review of threat assessment, plans, contingencies etc - central guidance/co-ordination?
0,791,0,669,Can BOCUs be given a steer as to the amount of money available to manage this operation. Their is a clear potential conflict between cost of overtime and welfare issues re 12 hour days and the cheapest way to cover aid
0,792,0,669,The &#039;adhoc&#039; selection of staff from Borough has greatly impacted on the operational efficiency. Whilst always willing to provide any resource requested, can I suggest that the MPS creates a service mobilisation plan in respect of resourcing any future SO 13/12  led investigations and so there is a much more structured response and understanding of what specialist skills are required to be maintained on each Borough.
0,793,0,767,Is there likely to come a time when the MPS reviews what its day job is. As a result of more attacks the strain across the board would be immense and some of the juggled balls would surely drop or need to be placed to one side for a while.
0,794,0,664,The limited number of Sec 44 stops usage is a surprise. As the previous comment - Is this lack of knowledge and fear of use, under recording or lack of direction.
0,795,0,669,In terms of managing stations. Has anyone considered closing as a matter of course those stations that have very little through traffic. It may be something for the networks to consider particularly outside normal commuting times. Less resources standing around providing re-assurance to no-one in particular.
0,796,0,668,Seems to be little being communicated by the centre to local transport ie. bus companies eg Local bus companies have had little guidance and reassurance from TfL/TOCU
0,797,0,717,Jonathan. Will this be sent out all BOCUs, what happens next?
0,798,0,784,One of the best ways to keep staff motivated and engaged is to provide them with high quality briefings and a diversity of tasks to perform. Simply standing at the entrance to a Tube Station for more than a day or two can be soul-destroying. I accept that local Boroughs have significant responsibilities for the quality of briefings etc - but we are restricted by the quality of information and taskings being provided Centrally.
0,799,0,791,I have steered away from 12 hr shifts due to the resilience issues that this will cause me in the long term. I am concerned about the cost of the operation to my local budget and would appreciate an early steer as to where the funds will come from tp pay for this.
0,800,0,785,The emails have often not been the best way to get information out, or request it back, if the BLO is wrong in your database or the OCU Commander is AL, then messages have been missed or sat on the system for more than 2 hours when a response is required alsmost immediately. We need a better alert system. With an IBO this would be the place to manage such requests on each OCU but we will not have one for many moons yet.
0,801,0,752,Please let local Boroughs maintain contact with local communities. It works.
0,802,0,662,Already mentioned by colleagues but long term high visibility patrols on the scale that we have been undertaking are not sustainable for all boroughs.  Deploying 1+6 to every BR/LT station was considered above and beyond what was really required both internally and externally.  Strategic concept is not in question but allow BOCU&#039;s to manage delivery rather than dictating that deployments are non-negotiable.
0,803,0,668,Whilst clearly at times of new incident and new intelligence aid requirements will not be known in advance, however our duties are still getting last minute aid requests that should have been able to be a planned week in advance.<br />This leads to huge difficulties in contacting officers off duty (some of whom appear to avoid such warnings and need to be warned when on duty).
0,804,0,667,IAG involvement in local gold groups has been invaluabel. Consistent use of the same reps has provided consistency too.
0,805,0,669,Is it possible that we might wish to consider some sort of Emergency Powers programme for our PCSO&#039;s. In the event of situations like this an authority can be given to increase the powers of PCSO&#039;s for a period of time in support of the general MPS response.
0,806,0,653,Safer Neighbourhood and SMT presence outside mosque after Friday lunch prayers in  shirtsleeves without hat, body armour and HVP to join in lunch and conversation has been very well received.
0,807,0,662,Everything needs to be intelligence led. We need to be informed of why we are asked to do certain things without the need for any secret intelligence to be disclosed. For example was Thursdays increase in aid due to intelligence re further possible attacks or Anniversary reassurance. We do need to know this.<br />Reflect what others are saying that the overall strategy should be given to Borough and tactics decided by Borough-feeding these tactics back to a central point for quality assurance and feedback. A TP support Unit or team may have been useful to co-ordinate all of this.<br />Can well meaning NSY units not ask for info outside of the central Command structure as this was confusing. Also sending the same message to both Borough Commander, BIU and Duties was difficult for sorting out which had been dealt with and were these same or different messages. Need one single point of contact.<br />After saying all this, excellent work generally right across the MPS
0,808,0,660,WE have just gone to 12 hour shifts to be able to cope with the aid demands and policing of a large number of LTE/BR stations on the borough. Our OPS office are fielding constant complaints. I find this extremely disappointing that some do not apparently recognise disruption to their home lives is necessary at this time. We are trying to keep disruptions to a minimum. Long term our resilience is questionable if we are to avoid burn out of level II, firearms officers etc.
0,809,0,668,CO11, CO11 Rainbow and Op Emerald did not seem to be in sync. Caused multitasking on borough and a perception of bureaucracy.
0,810,0,799,I would be interested to know if you have had to use rest days to fulfill your commitments. Without knowing the size of your BWT it is difficult to have a view of operational effectiveness
0,811,0,662,Significant Health and Safety issue arising out of over use of individual officers...small boroughs struggle to spread the pain due to staff shortages and peak AL period.
0,812,0,663,Fast time arrests are one thing and there is no doubt that the reputation of the MPS has been significantly enhanced but lets not count our chickens...we have yet to secure extradition and ultimately convictions.
0,813,0,657,Can somebody feed back to the Commissioner how well he is doing on the TV. A real positive for the Met.  Brian Paddick too.
0,814,0,734,Absolutely agree - I know it is the first time it has been used like this, but having to scroll down every 10 seconds is frustrating and makes conversation participation difficult
0,815,0,662,Support comment re duplication, feedback from officers on aid seeing large numbers of officers doing very little. This includes duplication with BTP who were seen to be under deployed whilst MET officers were on cordons. Appears lack of joined up tasking. We have not seen BTP officer at outer London Transport links.
0,816,0,657,We too have used our local authority traffic wardens, street wardens and even the fire service made themselves visible! Need balance though between reassurance and raising fear.<br />We passed information out through schools and through other local authority workers. Improved our network of distribution of information. Sent out an excellent leaflet with contact numbers and reasurance messages in six languages to every resident in the borough.<br />A clear stength was that we had command strucure, Gold Group and our local authority colleagues all up and running by 10am on the 7th.
0,817,0,660,At present we are trying to keep the cost of aid etc down by utising available staff before resorting to overtime. This may in the longer term have a negative effect on our performance. A number of other boroughs seem to have adopted the policy of not worrying about overtime and utilising more officers from rest day working for pay. The concern about this is that money that is spent will not be re-imbursed, leaving little for normal policing (prisoners,court).
0,818,0,656,The deployment of HVP to transport nodes is a ueseful tactic to prevent/reassure etc. Will CO 11 make it known on what intelligence they used in assigning staffing levels to stations last Thursday as from a Borough perspective the levels at some stations were innappropriate. Was it footfall or specific intelligence?
0,819,0,656,Recent catering support has been poor...stories of out of date sandwiches and poorly planned meals...pizza slice, hash browns and sweetcorn as a meal.<br />Security outside Buckingham Gate was raised as a concern. Good terrorist target with little security.
0,820,0,717,When will we know the responses from MB
0,821,0,797,Absolutely!! I am so impressed with the level of engagement and the richness of the thinking.  I will prepare a report and disseminate this.  Thank you all so much.....keep going!!
0,822,0,820,I will deliver the report with Bill Griffiths to the Deputy
0,823,0,638,Chance to engage with young people and communities are facing up now to the fact that they have to look at their own security with our support. Also can&#039;t turn a blind eye to the fact that all communities don&#039;t really know what young people are doing. Raised the importance of engaging with young and disaffected youth to prevent them from becoming targets for recruiters
0,824,0,650,Inter faith engagement as well as engagement with the Muslim conmmunity has been important - particualrly in the sending out of joint lessages of soolidarity and community cohesion in the face of the attacks
0,825,0,791,I would like to see an unequivocal commitment to reimburse the full cost of this operation, since in past this has later been watered down.
0,826,0,660,Ensure don&#039;t over react but still remain focused and need to return to normality. Need to respond to intelligence and turn focus to getting best community intel rather than long term High Vis which will lose its impact.<br />Crime Performance will suffer! Using all proactive resources on this
0,827,0,650,Community briefings are hampered by the lack of clear sanitised material from the centre - we often look silly when we are briefing gold groups and community contactds on less infromation than they are getting from the media - including what police spokespeople are saying - the i nfromation flow needs to be faster time
0,828,0,668,As borough commander I found the lack of command and control dissapointing.<br />Different/duplicate requests demands from numerous departments Emerald, CO11, DCC4, now the new community tension team. I and my team have found the post community management of this operation to be poor.<br />We are submiiting report after report in ever changing formats at different times . This has led to frustration and lack of confidence in central co ordination and management. The patronising instructions on how to engage with our community has only compounded this belief.
0,829,0,650,Comunity confidence especially from the muslim community needs to be based on responsiveness to generic policing issues - dealing with hate crime, conduct of stop/search etc
0,830,0,650,Pre-existing channels of communication and relationships with key individuals are critical - we can&#039;t create them fast time.  All boroughs should have mandatory structures including inter faith and muslim forums as a requriement
0,831,0,660,Core business will be at risk until the end on the AL period (September). I have no proactivity to speak of and response teams are being kept to minimum strenghts. CID staff are on the streets, SN&#039;s are off their wards, street duties officers go untrained. Challenging times but as usual I have no doubt that we will get through them. I would ask that under performance against some areas of volume crime is seen as an area that we have littel control over during these times of heavy demand. Several new initiatives have fallen by the wayside as I have no staff to service them.
0,832,0,668,We have been very disappointed with the flow of information from the centre and the command structure. Like others most information has come from Sky news.<br />There has been a tendancy from the centre to micro manage local resources for reassurance without allowing local command structures to deliver on a Gold Strategy taking into account local issues and sizes/locations of stations, Mosques etc. When attempting to seek clarity or indeed challenge central dictates around local deployment nobody has been able to provide direction.<br />The recent deplyments for this week around tube stations have been dictated without asking for any feedback from last weeks operation. Many of our tube stations cannot accomodate the volume of officers in entrance areas due to size and there was some alarm expressed around the police numbers by the local community raising concern rather than reassurance. Tactical deployment should be left to Boroughs. Please seek feedback as well to inform future operations.<br />Finally can we have one central point of contact.
0,833,0,679,The Met was slow in getting effective family liaison arrangements in place at hospitals - we need to get this right for the future - early deployment of FLOs is vital, rather than waiting to see whether family members are confirmed as victims
0,834,0,668,We authorised the purchase of freeview boxes for all station TV&#039;s. This allowed for us to keep up with breaking news and kept staff informed.
0,835,0,785,I agree - there was too much use of multiple channels of communication from differnet central departmerts to different people/units on boroughs - we need earlier clarity about who is responsuible for what and a communication channel that everyone uses - e-mails to borough commanders, ops offices, rainbow, BLOs are too confusing and difficult to keep track of.
0,836,0,820,Having been working non-stop since 7/7 I am going on leave between Wed and Friday, running a DSO event on Sat.  Will try to get this out next week.  Keep going!
0,837,0,662,Its has already been said above.  Please please please trust boroughs to deploy appropriately.  As a Borough Commander I like to believe I am employed for my judgement not obedience.  The dictates coming from the centre have treated boroughs like children.
0,838,0,785,Community issues were particularly confusing - who in the early stages was Bx community for London needs to be clearer and the number of returns needed earlier rationalisation - demands for three hourly updates were ridiculous
0,839,0,724,I accept we have to follow directions on intelligence led operations in whcih we are not all included in the intelligence picture - what is needed in these cases are better briefings - eg if prevention rather than reassurance is the message and the tactics are based on delivering that then this needs to be reflected in the briefings we give staff
0,840,0,669,The impact of Theseus / Severus on volume crime I believe is and will be significant . The startegy seems to be business as usual and the plethera of performance indicators continue unabated with no acknowledegement of the biggest policing operation since the second world war. The continous demand for increased levels of performance against such a background only adds to the perception that managemnt board operate on different levels and have seperated the issues in their own mind.
0,841,0,801,WE HAVE MAINTAINED REGULAR CONTACT WITH ALL OF OUR IDENTIFIED FAITH GROUPS IN THE FORM OF MEETINGS AND VISITS.  THIS HAS TAKEN PLACE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY.  THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY HAS RESULTED IN THEM FORMALLY INVITING US TO A MULTI FAITH  FOUNDATION MEETING TO EXPRESS THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICES.  IT IS PROPOSED TO REVIEW THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES WE ARE IN CONSULTATION WITH IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE ISOLATION, FOR EXAMPLE THE SOMALI AND TAMIL COMMUNITY.  THE COMMUNITY CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN ENHANCED BY THE DISTRIBUTION OF MULTI AGENCY LEAFLETS.  FROM THE MUSLIM GROUP THERE HAS BEEN A SUB GROUP CREATED SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THE ISSUES OF MUSLIM WOMEN.  IN ADDITION TO THIS, ACTIVITY HAS ALSO BEEN CONDUCTED AT MUSLIM SCHOOLS AS PART OF OUR REASSURANCE PROGRAMME.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER 7/7 AND 21/7 WE INFORMED 40 FAITH LEADERS THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP LEAD IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH EARLY CONTACT AND REASSURANCE.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO HAVE HAD SOME FACTUAL INFORMATION FROM THE MPS.  REALISTICALLY WE WERE DEPENDENT UPON SKY TV FOR UPDATES.  ONE OF OUR ACTIONS WAS TO CONSTANTLY MONITOR RELEVANT NEWS CHANNELS TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EVENTS AND HOW THAT MAY HAVE IMPACTED ON OUR BOROUGH.  FOR EXAMPLE THE PACKAGE FOUND IN SCRUBBS LANE WAS ON HAMMERSMITH BOROUGH BUT VERY CLOSE TO OUR BORDER AND HENCE OUR COMMUNITY.  MANY OF OUR POLICE STAFF ARE LOCAL RESIDENTS  AND THEIR CONCERNS WERE ADDRESSED AT A MEETING ORGANISED BY THE BOROUGH COMMANDER.  THIS ASSISTED IN SENDING OUT CONSISTENT AND CLEAR MESSAGE.  SMT MEMBERS VISITED ALL MULTI FAITH PREMISES AND CONSISTENTLY REQUESTED THAT RACE HATE CRIME WAS FULLY REPORTED.
0,842,0,724,There is a clear need for every BOCU to have a sufficient level of vetting for the borough commander and/or deputy for there to be no question about inclusion in the intelligence picture - this must allow restricted briefings to be given to all borough commanders who would then better be able to manage the implementation of the tactics determined in response to the threat
0,843,0,817,We have moved to 12 hour shifts in preference to using rest day working. My view on this is that providing you manage the 12 hour system and share it about it is less consuming. Also we need to guarantee staff their days off for recovery. Particularly over a protracted period. It is also cheaper. I am also providing meals from the canteen because that is cheaper than refreshment allowances.
0,844,0,650,Please do not treat boroughs like they do not know their own communities.  The advice and must do&#039;s coming from the centre were a disgrace.  The fact they were drip fed also gave the impression that as soon as anyone in the centre came up with an idea it was pumped out to Borough Commanders.  The tone of some of the emails was also condesending.  Much more helpful would have been a list of &#039;have you considered doing this - with a menu of options&#039; .The time turnaround on some replies were also ridiculous.  Most Borough Commanders are not sat at their desks waiting for emails and most staff officers have been deployed on Theseus - therefore a two hour or next day reply is unrealistic!!
0,845,0,817,I don&#039;t think it is a case of not worrying about overtime. We still have to try and work within budget but I am more concerned about the impact long term on my staff if we expect too much and do not manage effectively their roles. Safeguard their days off and it gives time to recover.
0,846,0,669,The demise of the RVCTF has left a void within the organisation to properly respond to the community demands. TPHQ (Safer neighbourhoods/ Emerald) had to fill that gap from scratch. This was to stop boroughs being overwhelmed for information. No Templates or system in place. We were being led by COBRA&#039;s demands (update every 3 hours) and the National Coummunity Tensions Team which was quite ridiculous. The role of Bronze Community was not defined and the command structure around community tension. I feel that the tone I pick up is that we do not trust borough commanders to do their job so we demand plans and patronise them by stating the obvious. We need to incorporate this work into Safer Neighbourhoods and learn so that we do not get caught again.
0,847,0,652,ONE OF OUR OFFICERS WAS  A VICTIM OF THE INCIDENT WHICH OCCURED ON THE 21/7. HE WAS TRAVELLING ON THE TRAIN - WARREN STREET.  THE OFFICER HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE BOROUGH AND HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN AT THE LACK OF CONTACT FROM THE INVESTIGATION TEAM.<br />THE BOROUGH HAS DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY&#039;S CCTV OFFICE WHERE THEIR CAMERAS WILL REGULARLY MONITOR TRAIN , TUBE AND BUS LINKS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE WITNESSES IN THE EVENT OF FURTHER INCIDENTS TAKING PLACE
0,848,0,786,I don&#039;t think it is feasible to cancel all leave. Officers need time to recover. There is less likely to be increases in sickness if we are effective in communicating the methods by which we will cope with demands. The important thing is making sure that ALL staff within the MPS are contributing.
0,849,0,638,Revenue at tube stations has gone through the roof - in some cases an increase of 50%.  Although the cost benefit would need to be done I suggest some form of analysis around this because it could be cost effective for BTP and or MPS partnership to employ PCSOs at all transport hubs - purely through revenue increase (less fare dodging)
0,850,0,655,We have had two instances of irresponsible local news reporting. One linking a Community colleague to being a Hotbed of radicalism and terrorism. The second criticising a specific use of Sec 44 powers. The usage being in response to public information and belief a suspect may be a bus bomber. The officers acted responsibly and with respect. The report was clearly mis-represnting what the circumstances were. A strongly worded letter of complaint has been sent to the particular newspaper.
0,851,0,844,I agree and as one who had to impart some of the messages I felt that there was a lack of trust in the borough commanders. There is a real sense that the centre needs to know everything and there should be plans for everything. We did away with the link commander structure almost immediately which broke the link.
0,852,0,668,WE have had a couple of instances of central units approaching our officers direct to work in their unit. The first we knew of one such approach was when the officer telephoned from SO. We cannot effectively account for and be responsible for the welfare and health and sfety of our staff if approaches are not co-ordinated through a SPOC (Ops or whatever).
0,853,0,669,We have had to place our core teams on 12 hr shifts in order to release the late turn to supply central aid. The central aid is now larger than the late turn team requiring additional staff. Local reassurance patrol dictates take no account of the number of stations each borough has. In essence 35% of our BWT are on either local or central aid. This is peak annual leave time and school holidays (the latter presenting child care issues.) I note with interest the Commissioners recent speech which reminds staff of the need to take their leave. The Commissioners committment does not seem to have cascaded downwards. The reality is that to deliver the afore mentioned aid staff cannot take time off and we are having to make significant use of staff on rest days. We now are faced with challenges under Health and Safety and WTD and when we have raised these centrally we have little to no sympathy or understanding. Some staff have now worked 21days in a row and this cannot continue.<br />In addition the resilience for the CID departments and day to day investigations is neglible so we have now had to place the CID on 12 hour shifts.<br />I would like to see a review of aid requests and greater sympathy re WTD. Support from central units should be given to boroughs with an extensive number of stations or central aid should be reduced to reflect this.<br />I would also like to see a committment to full reimbursement.
0,854,0,662,Quick question about recent TfL deployments. How have they been decided upon - and what capacity is there for local Boroughs to influence/bid for them. They clearly represent a significant MPS resource (particularly in relation to transport links) - and yet we have experienced difficulties in getting assistance from them.
0,855,0,653,WE HAVE MAINTAINED REGULAR CONTACT WITH SPECIFIC GROUPS WHICH WE FEEL WOULD BE AT RISK.  THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THROUGH WEEKLY VISITS TO THEIR PLACES OF WORSHIP AND COMMUNITY CENTRES.  AT THESE MEETINGS A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT MESSAGE IS DELIVERED BY THE SMT MEMBERS WHO ATTEND WHICH REFLECTS THE MPS POSITION.
0,856,0,669,A quick win for officers and Borough operations - would be for Management Board to allow 15 days annual leave to be carried over for next year.  Hopefully this will smooth out performance issues over a longer period otherwise performance this year will really suffer.
0,857,0,669,I think it is time to acknowledge that it is NOT business as usual.  Boroughs are barely functioning and most investigations are being robustly screened - many potential sanction detections will be lost.  We obviously do not want to cause alarm within the community BUT THEY ARE NOT STUPID. Manangement board need to ensure portfolio heads are not demanding from boroughs their ususal service - for example the CCSM headed by Commander Foy should be one of the first casulties.
0,858,0,668,The learning from this about information flow for me has been:<br />(i) Have a system to monitor requests to and from boroughs, this should be through a gateway (was eventually Emerald/Safer Neighbourhoods but should have been RVCTF<br />(ii) Manage the National Community Tension Team demands (who work on behalf of COBRA every 3 hours was too much;<br />(iii) Each borough to set up a single point of contact e-mail address so that generic requests can be sent out not just through borough commanders<br />(iv) Do NOT  abandon the role of link commander as their role is crucial in supporting and communicating with Boroughs.<br />(v) Establish a seperate tension team command structure with roles defined up to MB level<br />(vi) re-invigorate community intelligence and address how it will collated and disseminated on a daily basis.<br />(vii) Have a daily community briefing sheet from the start.

0,860,0,662,POLICE ACTION INVOLVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF REASSURANCE PATROLS ACROSS THE BOROUGH AS WELL AS HIGH VIZIBILITY POLICING AT OUR TRANSPORT NODES.  REDEPLOYMENT OF BOMB CARS (OPERATION RAINBOW).<br />THE BOROUGH IMPLEMENTED 12 HOUR TOURS OF DUTY FOR NIGHT DUTY AND EARLY TURN LEAVING THE LATE TURN TO FILL THE LOCAL REASSURANCE PATROLS AND CENTRAL LONDON AID REQUIREMENTS.<br />OFFICERS WORKING IN SPECIALISED UNITS WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNIFORM DUTIES.  MUSLIM SCHOOLS REGULARLY VISITED.  DEDICATED OFFICERS EMPLOYED AT GTHE LOCAL AUTHORITY&#039;S CCTV OFFICE.<br />CONTACT MADE WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANNING OFFICER (EPO) AND GENERAL INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC VIA THE LOCAL PAPER, BRAIN WEBSITE (COMMUNITY WEBSITE), DAILY RETURNS PROVIDED B Y THE DCI IN RELATION TO FAITH AND HATE CRIME ACTIVITY.  SAFER NEIGHBOURHOOD TEAMS WERE USED FOR HVP REASSURANCE PATROLS WITHIN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD.
0,861,0,828,As a person who was trying to get a grip of this for TP I found the demand for information from boroughs was extrodinary and unnecessary. Who reads them and gives boroughs feedback? We were being led by the Government for COBRA and MB as they do not trust borough commanders to do thier jobs. Trust?
0,862,0,664,THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION AS TO THE SECTION 44 POWERS AND NORMAL STOP AND SEARCH, WHICH WAS RAISED AT THE DAILY MANAGEMENT MEETING.  FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR SB LIAISON OFFICER AN ACTION HAS BEEN REQUESTED IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER.
0,863,0,856,The organisation is not that far adrift from its targets and I don&#039;t believe the situation is beyond recovery. There may need to be a little more understanding about individual performances across the Boroughs. Upto the 7/7 our performance was challenged because it is said we had less funds than last year. Unfortunately the success we had last year although significant was bought. Without funding we have gone back to almost where we were. Someone needs to understand that we need to learn how to manage success. I fail to see how carrying over 15 days would help. I will be inclined toward suporting those officers of mine who ask, as is their right, to carry 10.
0,864,0,660,THIS BOROUGH HAS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATION IN EUROPE AND ANY CONTINUED TERRORIST CAMPAIGN COULD AFFECT RELATIONS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AT LARGE.  SPECIAL BRANCH ARE AWARE THERE ARE SYMPATHISERS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE OPENLY SUPPORTED TERRORISM ON WEBSITES CREATED BY THEM, WHICH FURTHER ADDS TO THE RISK OF POLICING.
0,865,0,638,THE OPPORTUNITY TO GATHER COMMUNITY INTELLIGENCE AROUND TERRORIST ACTIVITY HAS BEEN GREATLY ENHANCED AND THE BENEFIT OF THIS WILL BE REALISED IN THE FUTURE.
0,866,0,669,Is it time to halt the service review as events have moved us on? We are still responding to demands for information for the SR whilst keeping the ship afloat. I assume we will be going to the Governemnt for more funding?

0,870,0,668,OUR BOROUGH&#039;S COMMAND STRUCTURE  WAS CLEARLY IDENTIFIED FROM THE ONSET OF 7/7 AND WILL REMAIN THROUGHOUT.  IT HAS IDENTIFIED A GOLD LEAD, SILVER LEAD AND NUMEROUS BRONZE&#039;S COVERING AREAS SUCH AS CRIME, PARTNERSHIP, INTELLIGENCE, MEDIA, COMMUNITY, RESOURCES AND FINANCE AND RESOURCES.  THIS STRUCTURE IS RECIPROCATED WITHIN OUR DAILY MANAGEMENT MEETING WHERE ISSUES ARE DISCUSSED AND UPDATED.
0,871,0,669,THE COMMENT OF &#039;BUSINESS AS USUAL&#039; CAN BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AS WE JUGGLE PERFORMANCE AROUND OUR PRIORITY CRIMES IN TERMS OF REDUCTION/DETECTIONS AND THE OVERWHELMING DEMANDS MADE FROM THE CENTRE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES.
0,872,0,717,The system will shut down 12:30.
0,873,0,663,The decision to allow transmission of the arrests may raise some very interesting issues when it comes to trail. I believe that it will be very hard to find an imprtial jury, and the defence will have a strong argument to say that their clients will not get a fair trial due to public opinion. Are the CPS on board will these issues? I trust so. My wife tells me it was compulsive viewing though!

1,1338,263,1325,Co-ordinating BTP Investigative response
1,1339,262,1325,to conduct static patrols at central locations with other officers from West Ham.
1,1340,217,1325,At the time, I was preparing only for cordon duties at Aldgate. when i arrived, the rescue/recovery effort was in full swing. I was happy to play any role, however small.
1,1341,267,1325,To provide support to nominated Gold
1,1342,255,1325,Had no idea, neither did person sending me, only knew it involved mortuaty
1,1343,253,1325,No clear role given, no direction received. Asked to be considered if there was to be any involvement in mortuary work. Told that it would be sorted out following day
1,1344,221,1325,as a high profile high vis police prescence at the mainline stations prevention and protection
1,1345,264,1325,my role as stated was to set up a body reception centre at a local hotel.
1,1346,258,1325,Attend a briefing at Hendon re mortuary duties pm 08/7/05
1,1347,219,1325,Requested to attend btp hammersmith to standby, re potential Victim Recovery duties, once a clearer picture revealed extent of incidents
1,1348,245,1325,wnet to Liverpool st and then Aldgate to help with evacuation not given a specific role, wanted to help in any way.
1,1349,223,1325,I was aware that there may have been secondary devices and helped to set up cordons around the area to keep the public safe
1,1350,224,1300,i did not have an initial role until being instructed to attend the mortuary
1,1351,212,1325,my initial role was to attend waterloo station to conduct initial area search of both stations and organise resources for high profile security presence
1,1352,217,1332,I agree - when I was directed to the Mortuary the next day, I recieved no input as to what the next two and a half weeks would entail - what we would see, hear and smell.
1,1353,270,1325,When the scale of the incident was established I requested staff to start maintaining a log of events. I briefed the head of the Govt Office for London. I then contacted the relevent Coroners to brief them.
1,1354,242,1325,I had absolutely no idea what was expected of me in the mortuary until we started working in there. once we got going it all fell into place.
1,1355,218,1342,Was lead to believe that we were to do cordon duties at HAC. Had no idea what the true extent of the duties I was to be involved in.
1,1356,269,1345,why were bodies going to a hotel?
1,1357,214,1349,Would this prevent you entering the scne as it was to rescue the public?
1,1358,245,1325,given job at temp mortuary the following day but no real idea what that involved
1,1359,217,1320,there was little to no information for officers directed to the mortuary about the tasks required of them. it was only on arrival there we found out exactly what was needed
1,1360,270,1346,Although I was responsible for establishing the mortuary I was not aware of this briefing
1,1361,260,1336,what did you expect
1,1362,226,1325,Had no direction just went with my instinct and assisted where I could, once on scene
1,1363,224,1346,got all the way to Hendon only to be told we had to travel down to HAC for a futher briefing. Time wasted
1,1364,261,1332,I agree also, I was led to believe that mortuary duties would be a short term deployment not two and a half weeks.
1,1365,218,1352,There was only a very breif description of my duties on arrival. Was told that if you completed the paperwork incorrectly then it could cause major complications in the investigation. As I had never even seen the forms before or completed them, it would be true to say I was a little worried.
1,1366,245,1361,everyone was learning new skills
1,1367,217,1354,I agree with this. for the first couple of days it was very stressful
1,1368,267,1354,Knowingwhat you do now, what sort of briefing would you give someone today, now who is expected to do what you did in say 1 hours time?
1,1369,212,1342,on the second day i was contacted and directed to attend hendon for mortuary dties, and told all i needed was a pen and clipboard
1,1370,270,1356,There was a lot of confusion as to the location of the body holding areas for each site especially the Tavistock Place site.
1,1371,220,1332,after initial confusion at hendon,attended at mortuary and fully briefed on duties.
1,1372,269,1346,There was no briefing at Hendon no one knew what was going on we were then sent to HAC
1,1373,264,1345,it was identified at an early stage to be a suitablr venue.which it was never going to be. at least a dozen officers wasted the whole day there.poor communication did not assist
1,1374,267,1345,Was this the Russell Square Incident?
1,1375,264,1374,yes it was.
1,1376,242,1332,No body can know how long these things are going to take, we just had to be flexible.
1,1377,224,1332,I too agree, and worst of all was not given an option not to carry out that role.
1,1378,218,1355,Although I had no idea of what I was doing at the start. It was an experience I do not wish to forget. The learning curve went from 0 - 100 in a day.
1,1379,223,1357,there were numerous units on site , but it became apparent that even when taking out the initial walking wounded there was 100-150 on lookers.One senior fireman asked whether the immeadiatte area had been searched and no one was sure
1,1380,245,1364,once the confusion at Hendon was over, fully brief re sights and time of operation
1,1381,270,1358,BTP need a formal trained Body Recovery Team who are aware of their responsibilities.
1,1382,220,1354,little or no information at hendon.all became clear at mortuary site.
1,1383,212,1364,this is not strictly true it was explained that the duration was at least 10-14 days and it only just went over the 14 day period
1,1384,217,1368,i&#039;d tell them what they&#039;d expect to see, hear, smell. warn them about h&amp;s when lifting bags, bones poking through bags which happened a lot, i&#039;d tell them to take regular breaks, and to look out for everyone&#039;s welfare, not just their own. they&#039;d need to know as much about what they were to face as possible.
1,1385,218,1372,When BTP uniform officers arrived at HAV they had no idea what they were to do there.
1,1386,226,1332,Again I agree.  I requested to be considered for the mortuary and was fortunate to be deployed there.  However with no structure initially in place it took a while for the set up and requirements of me to be understood .
1,1387,219,1373,were bodies placed into this body holding area.
1,1388,253,1368,That one needs to be of a certain type to be able to cope with the situation. That you need to be able to detatch yourself from empathy with the victim. To put people in that position who had no preparation, or who had not volunteered for such a deployment could be very unfair, and reflect on the organisation poorly. One such person was deployed, and in the end had to leave.
1,1389,265,1374,there was suggestion that the army establishment in handel street , about 3 mins from the scene should be used - can you comment on this
1,1390,224,1336,we were requested to attend our area hq, surround the management so they felt safe and then return to stations where we left from in order to be used in the cordons
1,1391,258,1346,established that there was almost no practical relevant experience amongst the btp contingent detailed for the mortuary.
1,1392,218,1354,Totay agree. It all very soon started to fall into place
1,1393,270,1342,We need a properly trained  mortuary team to respond to these incidents and train crashes
1,1394,261,1368,I would explain to them about the particular distastes of the job along with how important it is. But also it would help if a dedicated resource was set up for incidents like this.
1,1395,245,1377,the option to leave was given to all on the first day at the mortuary
1,1396,267,1377,If you had been better briefed at to what was expected of you for the role you ended p doing, would you have felt better able to voice an objection to carrying out the role you did
1,1397,262,1353,Prior to this event were there any directives in place for such an event that were not passed out to the sector stations within the LU so as officers could react accordingly as it seemed to me that senior managers or event planning did not have a full realisation on how best to deploy officers and then when in situ officers still being contacted to attend other locations as part of other seriels, even though we were attached to the mortuary team and SO13.
1,1398,269,1364,it was pointed out at HAC briefing the job could last around 14 days
1,1399,221,1332,although i had many years of experience in the mortuary and had dealt with the bank exrcise i was missed off the list to attend the mortuary and felt that i was not utilising my skills
1,1400,219,1373,It is imperative that a body holding  area is identified, very early, so that evidence and continuity of those victims are maintained.
1,1401,223,1332,I was on static security patrols for a few days after and volunteered to be on the mortuary team.I am sure that some people are more suited to this work than others
1,1402,218,1384,Totaly agree. Also tell them of the lack of sleep on the first couple of days and the stress that they would be under. DONT PANIC!!!
1,1403,264,1389,i was at the hotel with an officer from so13. we thought the handel street venue more suitable,but had no idea who to communcate this to.
1,1404,217,1388,I agree -  every person in this room served BTP exceptionally well. it would be a crying shame if the skills learnt were not formalised and the organisation didn&#039;t take the opportunity to organise a body recovery/dvi team
1,1405,255,1332,It&#039;s now obvious that the people responsible for iniating movement for mortuary duties, i.e. the phone call had no idea what they were talking about
1,1406,250,1377,there was an option given prior to any mortuary duties for anyone to leave
1,1407,253,1381,Also need trained BTP DVI staff, the nucleus of which have the benefit of the practical experience of the time spent in the mortuary on Op Theseus
1,1408,245,1332,felt the BTP on the first day were more concerned about paying overtime than getting the job done, which was why we were all there.
1,1409,242,1368,DCI Williams gave a good initial briefing on the Friday but until you DVI a body you can&#039;t know what it&#039;s like. i do now .
1,1410,263,1332,MPS gave a criteria for the skills required in a preference order however the difficulty was identifying officers with the right skills quick time
1,1411,218,1381,Can not agree more. It would be a shame to lose the experience that all the officers gained during this difficult time.
1,1412,258,1346,understand that fraud squads are designated to carry out mortuary duties under the National Policing Plan. BTP contingent were made up of experienced CID from all London areas including Fraud Squad.
1,1413,212,1393,we now have a trained team who are wholly committed to assisting in any way in the future
2,1414,0,0,What am I most proud about
1,1415,220,1354,in the dark but fortunate be part of very good team with an xcellent supervisor.
1,1416,255,1414,Part of a job well done
1,1417,224,1414,being able to give the families of the deceased the identities within 7 days
1,1418,263,1414,The dedication and determination of officers to get a difficult job done
1,1419,214,1414,I am proud of the commitment and the uncomplaining nature of the people that pulled together to get the job done
1,1420,217,1414,I am proud to be part of BTP after this. we entered the mortuary untrained  and unaware of what was needed. we left it 2.5 weeks later with sincere thanks from DCI Williams for a job well done. Every person played there part to the full
1,1421,245,1354,I agree. now feel part of a special effort and feel the BTP should maintain the skills and allow these officers to be part of a national network to assist in the future where possible
1,1422,261,1414,Being able to be apart of something huge and important that whilst unprepared and uninformed about we did a very good job.
1,1423,270,1414,I was proud of being the author of the Mortuary Plan that everyone was working too and also the superb way the BTP at site responded to the challenge even though most were untrained for the role.
1,1424,218,1414,The team that I worked with was amazing. Although we had a very serious job to be getting on with, we kept our humour and kept an eye on each other to make sure we made it through a traumatic situation. We really did work as a team.
1,1425,260,1414,that me and my colleagues dived straight into something that we had never experienced before and learnt new skills
1,1426,220,1414,being part of good team and providing a valuable service to the families.
1,1427,215,1414,That non uniformed officers from BTP buildings &#039;dropped everything&#039; and went direct to scenes to assist the injured.
1,1428,265,1414,The fact that the BTP responded in such a positive and proffessional way  - that individual officers did some fanastic things - that the BTP is recognised throughout the world in an exceelant light
1,1429,226,1414,To have been able to work in such a dramatic incident and to say that we as a team helped those families that lost members of their family.
1,1430,250,1414,that i was part of an essential team with a very important role
1,1431,258,1414,part of a team that was motivated by working to help the families of the victims
1,1432,245,1414,being able to help those who has]d lost loved ones to be reunited with them through i/d
1,1433,211,1414,The recovery of the victims in a dignified manner, whilst working in very difficult working conditions on the train at russell square
1,1434,261,1420,Am proud to be BTP as if I hadn&#039;t  been with the force I wouldn&#039;t have had the chance to do what I did.
1,1435,267,1414,BTP didn&#039;t disgrace itself with the response provided to the multi-location incidents, which has been universally heralded as magnificent
1,1436,223,1414,I am proud to have contributed to helping the victims families get closure.I was pleased to be part of a team which did not look for the quedos but gave help and support to all the teams within the mortuary set up.
1,1437,224,1423,you need a good slap on the back for that one, it was nice to see that btp  could do something other that deal with ticket jobs as seen in eyes of other services prior to the operation
1,1438,221,1414,being a part of a team that got the job done and bonded as a family whilst at the village and showed the professionalism that BTP have and the dedication for the role they do
1,1439,220,1414,btp being treated as equals with the met.forging a good working relationship with them.
1,1440,253,1414,The fact that BTP, that can be percieved by some as a lesser Police Force, managed to produce a team of DVI mortuary personnel that not aquitted themselves well, without any training whatsoever, but also perform first rate work, that was completely integrated with the MPS, as opposed to the City Police who neither integrated so well, nor worked as well.<br />Also proud on a personal level that I managed to cope with the task in hand and do a good job.
1,1441,214,1423,Has anyone in authority tahnked you personally for devising the plan, and is it widely known that a BTP officer penned it?
1,1442,217,1424,the humour was needed. we needed that release from the stress and strain. everyone, from probationers to 28 year PC&#039;s performed amazingly well. we should all be proud of what we did
1,1443,245,1420,Agree, this experience has left me proud of my colleagues and myself and bonded to them
1,1444,270,1414,Although not everyone at the site was aware due to a busy work schedule I was pleased that every BTP ACPO member visited the mortuary.
1,1445,212,1414,as discussed with colleagues after the events of the mortuary had been completed ther was a sense of real achievement that we had ben able to reunite all the families with their lost ones, bearing in mind the condition of some of the bdies and body parts that had ben recovered
1,1446,218,1414,To be told on a regular basis by MPS that the un trained BTP doing body recovery from the site to the mortuary and of those taking the bodies from those officers, were doing it correctly and efficently.
1,1447,264,1414,by the time we were told that our hotel venue was not to be used we had managed to set up a facility that could have worked however unsuitable.To be part of the mortuary team and feel a sense of achievment.
1,1448,242,1414,I felt i was doing a valuable responsible and difficult job. I was proud to have been part of the team that dealt with the victims in a respectful way and identified them so they could be laid to rest by there loved ones.
1,1449,260,1420,i totally concur with the above
1,1450,269,1414,Being part of a team (DVI) that was contributing to a major incident. I knew the work we were doing was important to the investigation and to the victims families. For the first time in many years I felt I was doing something worthwhile.
1,1451,222,1414,The  service provided by BTP and MPS for  family members to view victims
1,1452,217,1440,i&#039;ll say it again - it would be a shame if these skills were just allowed to dribble away. let&#039;s build on them and expand them. we proved btp are just as capable
1,1453,218,1444,This could have been done a little sooner. Some of the teams at the mortuary did not see any BTP ACPO members and felt abandoned.
1,1454,270,1424,The BTP officers at the mortuary integrated seemlessly with the other officers from the MPS and City and also the other agencies. There was a very good rapport between everyone.
2,1455,0,0,What difficulties did I have to overcome
1,1456,262,1414,Being able to help out with the investigation as a young in service PC although not young in years and to be able to gain so much from other officers and finally being able to give some sort of closure for the familys of the victims. The team effort was great and working within an inviroment with a  great sense of humour and dedication to the job in hand.
1,1457,218,1452,Me to.
1,1458,245,1428,the respnse from other forces to the worked carried out by BTP at the temp mortuary proved we are now more respected than before
1,1459,212,1423,have to say that over the period of time we spent there with you and others and saw your creation grow daily was really a site to behold, i know we didn&#039;t fund it but the brainchild was ours and that is something you and we can be proud of
1,1460,223,1420,I agree , being young in service but not young in lifes experience helped me to get on with the job in hand.I particulary liked the fact that the senior officers did not play the rank game and it felt that everyone was on equal terms.This went for all the individual teams that i have never had dealings with before ie SO13 DVI etc
1,1461,245,1436,closure not a phrase families like, it will never be closed
1,1462,270,1451,This was exceptional and has become the &quot;gold standard&quot; for future incidents. It was amazing to hear the reactions of the bereived families
1,1463,267,1423,It was awesome to see that which only appeared in paper form, before the 7th July, appear in front of your eyes, over the few days it took to build, and know that someone from BTP had had a hugh input to planning, designing and eventually seeing it constructed for the first time in the UK
1,1464,217,1450,yes. horrible though it was, the work was also highly interesting
1,1465,253,1423,Must admit it was first rate that you were so fundamental in production of the plan. At a time when BTP seem to have gone completely backwards in secondments and attachments out of force, here are you, in a key position to make a difference, and by goodness you did. The Senior Officers in the Firce should recognise the advantages of having people integrated with Home Office Forces, and other agencencies, even though at times it leaves a minor resourcing issue within Force. You did well, and everyone was proud that you were a BTP Officer
1,1466,226,1440,I feel that we walked into the mortuary with no idea and no skills to deal with what was expected yet when we left, we left with our heads held high and a big thank you from our colleagues in the MPS who looked at us in a different light after the work that was carried out with no moaning or complaints.  The job was there to be done and we done it with excellence.  WELL DONE!!
1,1467,269,1423,Who are you?
1,1468,262,1446,Having been passed this information will the officers dealing be thought of for future DVI or BODY RECOVERY COURSES.
1,1469,211,1389,TA centre handel street, would have been an ideal location, however the distance was just that to far, to maintain the movement of victims from the station to the TA centre, as the hotel was across the road from the station, Extra police officers would have had to be used to extend the cordons, and those officers were not available
1,1470,224,1455,fear of the unknown
1,1471,270,1455,Occasional snide remarks about &quot;railway police&quot; from a handful of Met Officers.
1,1472,245,1440,agree the city did not perform well and did not on the whole become part of the team, not team Met but team London
1,1473,217,1455,there has been little preparation for a return to &#039;normality&#039;.
1,1474,270,1468,Hear Hear!!!!!!
1,1475,222,1455,fatigue
1,1476,260,1455,we had no idea what we were meant to do
1,1477,258,1453,I was amongst those present that thought ACPO attendance @ the mortuary was slow. In hindsight there were more pressing engagements for the brass to attend. When it arrived it was sincere and interested.
1,1478,245,1455,being away from family
1,1479,265,1455,too many tasks &amp; not enough time to do them all!
1,1480,226,1455,Being sent to the mortuary with no skills or expertise in the paperwork required for such a huge operation.
1,1481,223,1455,Working within an unknown enviroment helping the met team liasing with LRT and WCC
1,1482,242,1471,Proud to be in the railway !!!!
1,1483,245,1479,dont agree from DVI side
1,1484,217,1470,this could have been made easier on us had they taken ten minutes to tell uswhat it was actually about
1,1485,215,1455,Getting the Met to acknowledge and act upon the assistance being offered by BTP
1,1486,270,1476,This again leads back for a properly trained BTP team
1,1487,224,1455,obnoxious people who thought that they as a force were better than us.
1,1488,220,1455,main difficulty was being away from home and working long hours.
1,1489,218,1455,The paperwork. The forms were new for everyone (MPS and BTP). At first I was unsure what to do. After a quick brefing on the forms and the body recovery book and after a few runs, it all fell into place.
1,1490,262,1455,Having just becoming a Dad for the third time , juggling a six weeks prem baby and my other two kids and wife with the task in hand.
1,1491,255,1455,This has been said before, it was quite simply having no idea what to expect work wise. Most of the non BTP there had at least attended theoretical courses.
1,1492,250,1455,getting paid my correct overtime
1,1493,261,1455,Being unprepared for what to expect and not having any kit for the first few days which meant performing mortuary duties in uniform.
1,1494,270,1470,Training requirement!
1,1495,222,1480,i agree we need dvi training
1,1496,253,1440,We are just as capable, and of course finance is a consideration, but so is morale within Force. It was good to be able to be appreciated by colleagues in the Met, to learn new skills, and for once have the support of Senior Officers, without pennypinching, or jealously that we were under MPS control.
1,1497,218,1485,Very long hours.
1,1498,267,1455,Having to take on the role sometime into the incident and not from the very beginning of the incident.  This allowed matters at the mortuary to get to a point where issues were occurring which were detracting from what the officers there needed to be doing, but because they had no single focus ment they were trying to get answers for questions which no one would give them
1,1499,260,1482,the grass is no greener on their side
1,1500,269,1455,It was a personal challenge to work in the mortuary. Having little experience of dead bodies and pathology I was unsure of my reaction to the situation. Although difficult I coped well as did my colleagues who I knew had similar feelings.
1,1501,218,1471,Didnt let it get to me. What were they doing? Cordons?
1,1502,253,1444,CC did attend, however he talked to MPS, and to one BTP Officer only.
1,1503,221,1455,the intergration from the running of the mortuary in the NHS to the police force and dealing with victims of explosion was a shock i thought i had seen everything but first day in the mortuary at HAC i felt like i knew nothing
1,1504,242,1455,Being away from home not knowing for haw long
1,1505,217,1470,it was clear in the first couple of days senior managment appeared to have no idea what they were sending us to. when i asked for a phone i was told &#039;go inside and use one&#039; inside where? when clothing became an issue, was initiallt told &#039;go to marks and sparks and buy all your own stuff&#039; no one actually new what we were doing. not even our area management team
1,1506,224,1455,not having our own managers contacting us to check on our welfare, baring in mind that the met and city all had welfare as a top priority.
1,1507,264,1455,whether or not i would be able cope working in the mortuary. i did not want to let myself or any of my colleagues down.
1,1508,245,1480,brings us back to point not to let those skills now gained go to waste and for BTP management to take the Railway blinkers off and allow those now trained (the hard way) to assit other forces as well as our own if other incidents occurr.
1,1509,223,1479,don&#039;t agree due the to nature of the event.I feel that we did work long hours but ,and if the problem was still there the next day  it got fixed.
1,1510,265,1486,Hopefully this process will lead to a cog decision inrelation to DVI teams for btp, we should either have them fully trained or not at all
1,1511,212,1455,over the first few days there were numerous difficulties at the mortuary, firstly financial, overtime being a major concern and withdrawal of services if mps didn&#039;t pay. fear of not knowing what to expect ie state of bodies fear of not knowing what was to be expected of us the list is endless
1,1512,217,1486,yes
1,1513,267,1484,Is &quot;they&quot; within BTP (who in theory would not know) or those organising the mortuary who perhaps would have had more idea, but were so busy preparing for the arrival of the bodies didn&#039;t have the time?
1,1514,226,1476,I feel that the BTP should have it&#039;s own dedicated DVI team and there is no-one better than the people that are sitting here now and those that could not make it today!!  Sort out those courses BTP!!!
1,1515,270,1495,The mortuary training course is only 3 days long - not a huge investment for such an important subject when the lack of training could lead to cross-contamination which could compromise an important investigation.
1,1516,223,1486,agree
1,1517,245,1487,I did not get this from the met officers I wrked with, City are different ....odd.
1,1518,260,1495,this is something at least the coppers at the sharp end know needs to happen but will the management learn and take action
1,1519,253,1508,Completely agree. We were ambassadors for the BTP response, and we did well. We should be utilised again, now that we have practical experience
1,1520,218,1479,Only on the journey to and from sites. If you collected more than 20 body parts / bodies, you had not completed all the continuity sheets by the time you arrived at HAC. However, we were never rushed, the job was to imortant and that was always made clear to us.
1,1521,261,1507,I agree, I was more concerned about letting my colleagues, the force and the victims down.
1,1522,242,1471,Never had anything said to me in malice. Anyway you have to give them stick back, council clowns.
1,1523,211,1468,BTP have one DVI recovery officer, there should be serious consideration for this force to have its own dVI
2,1524,0,0,Welfare
1,1525,270,1492,At least someone from FHQ came to sort out overtime, expences, hotel bills etc which was more than the other forces.
1,1526,245,1455,having a day off and feeling like I should be back with colleagues during the operation
1,1527,253,1517,Totally agree. MPS were professional, and we integrated without any problem, and are every bit as good. The City however are just odd!
1,1528,267,1473,Not sure wer ewill every return to normality, the big question now is what is going to be the new &quot;norm&quot; and how will this be communicated to everyone.
1,1529,263,1455,lack of information from MPS S013 in relation to certain investigative parameters which caused delay (cctv retrieval parameters/intel links) which caused some frustration in resources sitting around but not deployable as SO13 had primacy
2,1530,0,0,Leadership / Management
1,1531,253,1525,This was much appreciated, and it was a good touch.
1,1532,224,1487,having to fight to get the overtime and expenses back.
1,1533,217,1498,once bronze was appointed, a lot of pressure was released and we could get on with the job at hand. that was really helpful, and I had been asking for a site supervisor for 3 days
1,1534,212,1507,again i agree with this but as far as i am concerned not one of us let  anyone down and can all leave with our heads held high
1,1535,264,1506,i agree that our feeling was that they had been stung into a response rather than a genuine concern for welfare
1,1536,223,1510,spot on, there is a need for BTP to be trained given the amount of incidents we deal with .Lets start promoting ourselves as we obviously have keen enough staff to want to learn these skills and we have shown that with almost no prior training how good we can be.
1,1537,269,1487,Can&#039;t agree with this I have never had problems with officers from other forces including those at the mortuary. Mind you them City boys and girls..................
1,1538,260,1526,we deserved it
1,1539,211,1446,The only BTP dvi officer is met trained and is on C11call out, therefore there were no untrained btp officers recovering victims
1,1540,218,1480,It would be a great loss if the officers who were trained on the job by MPS (who thought that we were already trained) did not receive formal training. MPS made it clear to us that we did a truly difficult job but amazed them with how proffessional we were
1,1541,226,1479,If there was one thing I was told whilst at the mortuary. Doesn&#039;t matter how long it takes do it properly and don&#039;t rush.  We got there in the end.
1,1542,270,1498,With about 30 BTP at the mortuary it would have been very useful for an Insp on site for the initial 2 weeks to handle any problems queries etc.
1,1543,221,1486,there should now be put into place a dedicated team of DVI officers for BTP if they listen to one comment it should be this one
1,1544,263,1455,knowing that we were deploying untrained/untested resources into crucial roles
1,1545,258,1480,First practical problem was the need for appropriate kit. On this occasion the Met &amp; City were glad to let us mump their kit. Next time (hopefully not) we MUST have a readily available supply to get over the first 48 hours
1,1546,267,1486,Unlikely due to cost implications for BTP.  We would be very unlikely to use the skills on our own patch very often and would leave ourselves open to having to lend those with the skills to national and international incidents which would have the &quot;Paymasters&quot; particularly LUL asking &quot;why are we paying for this&quot;
1,1547,253,1514,Who needs a course, when we had nearly three weeks of practical experience, dealing with more bodies than any other incident before? We are trained now!
1,1548,220,1473,having just returned from g8 for a week to then after a few rest days go to london for 8 days.return home for  a few rest days and then return to london for a further 12 days for high profile patrols.so out of all of july only spent about 6 days at home.at home i found it difficult to unwind/relax.i also found it difficult to eturn to normal beat duties.
1,1549,269,1490,sounds like you needed a rest
1,1550,218,1533,Cant thank bronze enough. They realy did take us under their wing.
1,1551,245,1504,wanting to speak about it but to those outside of our tam. we were like a tented village and did not want to retuen to normal duty, as I did not think anything could compare, and I was right
1,1552,223,1471,Don&#039;t worry a complaint went into there inspector , due to the un-professionalism during there tour of security cordons.
1,1553,262,1506,Agreed, having to wait for Mr Trotter to attend the site to ensure that we were not the forgotten lot from the Railway. His efforts ensured that a nominal person was put in place to look out for our welfare and other issues.
1,1554,261,1537,Agree, I had two stand up rows with the same City Pol officer refusing to let me through the scene cordon until I signed in even though I had to drive around the block to gain access and was the body recovery team.
1,1555,220,1475,found on some days going on automatic pilot/slow motion.
1,1556,222,1480,what prep are making for the next one
1,1557,269,1471,From my experience the BTP equited themselves very well and came oiut of this with flying colours!
1,1558,258,1540,Training is available (mortuary &amp; exhibits) - since we are a national force &amp; obviously transport is a key target we must not let this opportunity slip.
1,1559,220,1524,impressed by met who offered occ health and welfare support.
1,1560,267,1542,I&#039;m unclear as to whether or not Gold was aware of the extent of the collected BTP involvement until far too late into the operation of the mortuary.  A senior BTP officer there from day 1 would have help that communication flow immensely and could possibly have prevented some of the problems that surfaced in those initial days.
1,1561,262,1524,Being given full and frank advice from Metpol officers within the mortuary team whom had a wealth of experiance within this field.
1,1562,226,1490,Souns like you need to get back to work....
1,1563,222,1524,excellent support from both btp and met
1,1564,210,1530,the team i was part of was very fortunate to have an excellent met inspector for our leadership.
1,1565,261,1473,Finding hard to adjust as have to ask myself how can adapt to a 5 3 A now after being involved with dealing with 56 bodies.
1,1566,253,1524,Thought BTP did us proud, okay we didn&#039;t get boots and had to mump gear from MPS and even the City, before long BTP sorted out meals at hotel, sorted out some clothing for a very small minority of officers - but not all - and generally offered support better than ever before experienced in 25 years, even got a BTP strap for my warrant card.
1,1567,267,1524,As ever BTP think about this issue when it rears its head through problems.  Never one of the first things that are done for any incident
1,1568,265,1530,H&amp;S officer from FHQ did attend to look at arrangements for BTP officers
1,1569,255,1559,Did BTP occupational health make a personal visit at all, or was I asleep?
1,1570,270,1559,The Met Occ Health and Welfare were supposed to be representing all 3 forces but I am not sure the message got through. I know BTP Occ Health &amp; Welfare were in contact with the Met team
1,1571,218,1563,I felt the BTP gave a very delayed approach. We did not have the correct clothing and this took a few days to get dealt with.
1,1572,217,1524,for the first couple of days it was a bit of a joke. the organisation had no clue what we were doing in there until acpo came and saw for themselves. the met at one point were considering replacig us because we hadn&#039;t even been given a psychological (i think that&#039;s how u spell it) assessment before hand, they were concerned probationary officers were in the mortuary (although they recognised they performed fantastically). being told replacment clothing was something we&#039;d have to sort out oursleves at own expense. however once they realised what we were doing, things did get better.
1,1573,226,1524,It shocked me as to the initial LACK of response and concern for the Mortuary team from BTP.  Eventually it arrived but by that time everyone was talking to each other and dealing with things in a different way.  The MET in the mortuary were great and their knowledge and advice was a great help, speaking to a couple of them now and they are still checking were ok.
1,1574,223,1524,I felt that management were aware to a degree although I know that there were people there that have been affected by previous major incidents!Did those poeple recieve prior councelling ensuring that they were ok to work within the enviroment.Is there a collated record of what events officers have attended in order to ensure that the same person is not used always unless they are absoulutly ok with it?
1,1575,245,1524,full support from the met machine. after the early moans about money the BTP came through with excellent support. individual officers from the LT div supported us off their own back
1,1576,221,1524,occ health did not approach me until last week for a welfare check
1,1577,260,1490,when will you learn
1,1578,210,1530,management at the mortuary offered constant support and checked upon are welfare.
1,1579,224,1524,The fact that for the first two weeks that we were at HAC, the Met and CIty Occ Health Telephone numbers both office and emergency numbers were on the board in the briefing room. where were ours?
1,1580,255,1570,Is that good enough?
1,1581,269,1524,I don&#039;t have any complaints about welfare. Considering the situation we were housed fed and clothed well. BTP reacted a little slower than Met &amp; City but hey that&#039;s why we luv em!
1,1582,261,1524,Felt like we were cut loose from the forcr and had to fend for ourselves. Met set up the temporary mortuary in 24 hours BTP took 48 hours to get us some clothing.
1,1583,265,1567,I think we have to remember that we are still limited as a force, unlike the MET we don&#039;t have a dept or person to cover everything
1,1584,253,1530,Thought BTP DCC Trotter came across the best on the media briefings, albeit he is ex MPS. Put Paddick, and others to shame, makes a change for BTP.
1,1585,258,1559,Strange how small things leave lasting impressions. viz cold drinks available in the changing rooms. Massages etc.
1,1586,222,1530,management available if needed
1,1587,263,1524,Welfare was a priority from the very start with occupational health and Area HR&#039;s fully engaged - I was impressed with the dedication and understanding of the issues and what was put in place
1,1588,262,1546,This is a very narrow minded view i think as the PAYMASTERS should put themselves in the boots of those that lost loved ones. We would be an asset to the force and the job , How much did it hurt the bank balance by having us within the mortuary team having had no background in this field and being away from sector. This is a task that we would take on again without having to be asked.
1,1589,270,1567,Agree - BTP Welfafe and Occ Health need more resources and maybe more acknowlegement from Management.
1,1590,212,1530,this covers two areas firstly BTP, management was pretty poor to start with from area, political issues, financial issues and using us as pawns not good, changed when FHQ got involved and improved no end.<br />the management and leadership displayed from DCI Williams is something i will never forget and born motivator and leader, could teach some of us a few things
1,1591,218,1580,The BTP OH are there for the BTP, they are employed for us, not to liase with MPS, but with its BTP officers.
1,1592,245,1566,BTP endded up supplying clothes where needed but not all officers were catered for
1,1593,269,1566,Some officers seemed to get a lot more clothes than others.
1,1594,267,1559,Yes they did but didn&#039;t get the message out to everyone who was there and stayed for two hole days - one was a Friday, so those who didn&#039;t have to stay had left the site Arrangements were made at a higher level to have OH advice provided if required by MPS staff at the Mortuary, and then BTP set up its own system at the hotel by week 2 of the incidents running
1,1595,242,1530,Graham Williams was a bloody good leader in what must have been a very stressful job. Good old fashioned common sence man [sorry resource] management. He was universally respected as a good guv&#039;nor so he got the most out of his troops. Some BTP higher ranks could learn a lot from him.
1,1596,265,1570,BTP occ health were indunated dealing with officers who were first responders, it was also the welfare officers first week in post
1,1597,253,1582,Think this is unfair, it makes a change for BTP management  to let us integrate with MPS like this, and thought the support offered was good. There was a great deal of support, also the visit by the CI and a Civilian to purchase a few - but not all - officers with clothing to tide them over.
1,1598,218,1530,Would love to of been able to meet them. Never got approached or managed to speak with them.
1,1599,217,1578,as soon as we got a bronze appointed, things startes to flow better. a lot of the initial stuff i had to sort out myself in between shifting bodies about. once bronze arrived, these pressures were released and I could concentrate on other things like the job at hand. had a very diasppointing comment from an l area senior when I enquired about dvi/brit training, it was along the lines of &#039; we should just let everyone else do that&#039;.
1,1600,264,1524,Met and City semed to have a structured welfare response. Our force seemed to have no idea unless told. Probably because BTP have no idea about the practicalities of DVI and therefore no idea what we may be going through or may reqiure in support. i got the feeling that management hoped it would all go away.<br />I have been contacted by Met colleagues on welfare issues.
1,1601,270,1524,I was involved with the mortuary at Fulham for the Tsunami and was told that from the Welfare aspect I was an &quot;honorurary&quot; MetPol Officer. - So much for that - I never heard from them again but did get good support from Sue Maxfield.
1,1602,267,1580,Space limittations become an issue and access to the mortuary premises - no excuse but the MPs team were not exactly overwhelmed with work, although BTP could have put someone in that team to work for us
1,1603,226,1530,The MET Insp and sargeant running the pod site were great.  Always there and always checking ensuring that we were catered for.  This was important for our initial arrival as they took the time to go through the requirements as the days went on.  Did not feel as though i could not approach them with questions
1,1604,253,1595,Totally agree about DCI Williams he was inpirational, and accepted BTP support totally. He got the best from all the teams
1,1605,261,1595,Agree he looked after all of us and made us feel part of his team not BTP thrown in to help the Met.
1,1606,221,1573,no one from btp asked me if i was up to date with my vaccinations this was important as we were dealing with so many different victims with no medical history to go on for example hep c infected victims
1,1607,270,1524,All the BTP worked long hard hours and did not want to take any time off as they were proud of the work they were doing.
1,1608,217,1502,he spoke to a few of us, but was gone in the blink of an eye
1,1609,265,1572,yes  I was concerned that probationers had been given this posting
1,1610,255,1576,Was that through the Met?
1,1611,218,1593,Some officers were there for a long length of time, never getting home and living out of a bag at hotels (that were offered to all). Some of the duties that officers were doing required lots of clothing as it was getting contaminated.
1,1612,223,1582,there was plenty of clothing from MET, I know that once word got around there was a rush on the stores .It was gone within hours and I believe I am correct ,that we spent &pound;10,000 the first week on clothing that was at all three sites MET money that is.
1,1613,210,1524,the met had food and drinks available throughout the shifts.
1,1614,267,1571,Very true and a direct result of no senior BTP officer assigned to Mortuary from the start, no focus for officers to direct their concerns to at the site
1,1615,217,1524,by the end, really good. but took a long while to get going
1,1616,245,1530,the CC attending but did not seek out the BTP officers to speak to, in fact he walked past was odd. DCC ACC (pacey) Supt Carroll all made a point to speak to officers as did royal family
1,1617,223,1607,yep , good answer
1,1618,262,1530,I worked hand in hand with officers from West Ham and found that we were very much left to our own train of leadership and self managment. Sgt HILL and DI TIPPING were outstanding in the field as was Mr TROTTER a true leader.
1,1619,221,1576,no through btp
1,1620,253,1593,I agree, all I wanted was a pair of training shoes
1,1621,269,1582,Don&#039;t agree, we are all big boys and girls and can sort minor matters out for ourselves and I think we should be expected to sort out small problems ourselves.
1,1622,212,1598,they did turn up from FHQ and showed support and if you were around they did speak to us, although it was a bit late in the day, NO senior officer from London South though , i notice
1,1623,211,1547,DVI includes recovery and Mortuary skills. All the officers who completed there duties in the mortuary have only completed part of the requirments, therefore need practical training in recovery. There are many aspects to recovery that need considering ie Crime Scene managment etc, it is no simple task to recovery a victim. so please do not think by completeing a good job which you all did  in the Mortruary that you now a recovery officer
1,1624,270,1586,When Chief Con attended the site he wanted to gather all BTP to speak to them but was told that this would be impractical as most were booted and suited in the mortuary.
1,1625,265,1584,yes andy trotter is good &#039;BTP talking head&#039;
1,1626,217,1609,however, they performed magnificently
1,1627,253,1593,Some officers needed more clothes than others, as they didn&#039;t have much to start with
1,1628,255,1524,perhaps o h need extra training
1,1629,261,1616,Disagree the Chief did turn up and spoke to some of us but was only on site a short while.
1,1630,226,1618,I agree.  When the cards were layed down we showed our true colours and they shone through brightly!!
1,1631,267,1592,Efforts were made on most days to contact everyone at site regarding needs and wants-however, it was noted that officers still didn&#039;t not all get what they needed.  Although everyone was advised to make personal provision for what they needed and claim it back.  not ideal, but then officers could not be called out the work they were doing, just so they could be escorted down to M &amp; S to get clothes etc.
1,1632,253,1613,On the DVI side there was no Met and BTP divide.....we were one team.
1,1633,224,1574,certain management didn&#039;t even bother contacting us, but made comment to our colleagues who were left in the office on &quot;bet your glad your did&#039;nt get sent there, do you know how they are getting on?&quot;. a simple phone call to us so we could vent our anger on them for sending us would&#039;nt have gone amiss
1,1634,212,1624,not correct we were standing on the parade square and he walked passed us twice
1,1635,245,1530,DCI William is a born leader. he was funny at the briefing but always focused on the job in hand. all officers would have worked any hours and any duty for him.
1,1636,218,1583,We deal with alot more major incidents than the MPS (ie train crashes). I always feel that we let our selves down when we have to use other forces to do the Body Recovery because they have trained officers. Is it not time that the BTP invested in a team? They can still continue with the usual duties until the next major incident.
1,1637,224,1576,your lucky I am being plagued with calls from Occ health, some of them are&#039;nt even for me
1,1638,222,1582,i agree this is unfair, we received everything we needed we just had to ask
1,1639,270,1613,EVERYONE had food and drinks available throughout the shifts - indeed it was available 24 hours a day - there was no distinction between police officers, technician or even the scaffolders.
1,1640,211,1486,This process can be easily remidied. the BTP DVI sole rep, can arrange and conduct  the training of a BTP DVI team
2,1641,0,0,If BTP is a learning organisation, what learning from Theseus must it take forward
1,1642,269,1584,Hear hear Mr Trotter did the BTP proud, it&#039;s good to have a senior officer that can speak to the media who is knowledgable confident and doesn&#039;t dribble.
1,1643,258,1530,I got an email that listed a choice of 3 detective inspectors to contact in order to book a hotel room.<br />My impression is that it took too long for BTPmanagement to delegate specific responsibilities and there was far too much duplication of work at FHQ.<br />In contrast, from the outset of the mortuary operation, people knew what they were responsible for &amp; accountable.
1,1644,223,1524,A massure (i think thats how you spell it) was brought down from Hendon,this was slightly confusing at first as he had to attend all three sites.Eventaully two of them were at the HAC but the downside to this was that the met serials who sat on chairs all day for a long 8 hours were first in the que.This was noticed and then I believed got sorted.
1,1645,210,1530,excellent relationship with the uniform met inspectors who were always approachable and very helpful.
1,1646,253,1624,There were plenty of BTP on rest period, stood a few yards from him, wearing BTP straps, yet he made no attempt to approach BTP Officers, just talked to some colleagues from MPS. Having said that appreciate that he came down, and that he flew the flag.
1,1647,245,1629,he managed to walk straight past several BTP officers and spoke with EX met colleagues. ACC Robb mage a point of speaking to most and was ready to listen
1,1648,226,1530,After being assigned to Mortuary duties on the Monday come the Wednesday Event planning or should I say &quot;Can&#039;t plan anything&quot; had 3 officers on static duties 12 hours the next day, mmmm...... Confused they were when Mr Trotter phoned them.
1,1649,267,1567,We need to look at this in the context of a response to a major incident.  MPS have many more to deal with than BTP and have Depts commensurate with those requirements.  BTP don&#039;t have to do this sort of thing very often, so what we need to do is get smarter at contracting it in when we need it rather than having staff at FHQ all the time- work in progress I&#039;m told!
1,1650,255,1628,Or at least a up to date map of London
1,1651,265,1621,Good point , it can sometimes be the more you do for people the more they expect - there is a minium standard though which should be achieved
1,1652,217,1446,i think what&#039;s meant here is that the guys doing the van runs from the site were untrained, not that you weren&#039;t
1,1653,245,1629,WHY?
1,1654,261,1530,Certain L area senior officer in EPT seemed to be trying to interfere with postings of people and more concerned with his own self importance.
1,1655,253,1647,Totally agree. CC only spoke to Kevin Gordon, none of DVI teams, and left. Mr Robb made a point of walking around and speaking to the troops on the ground. He did a first rate job.
1,1656,223,1633,you have lost me on that one ?
1,1657,264,1530,We have senior officers who as individuals are experienced in DVI. But there is no corporate response and i feel there never will be as long as someone else can do the work for them. I have since submiited a report to ACPO on  our DVI  response and  have received no reply which is what i expected. The BTP is a good Force but on occasion we at senior level let ousselves down.
1,1658,270,1524,There needed to be a proper one to one de-brief when staff left the mortuary. Although Police Officers are slow to admit it - everyone at the site was subject to stress on some scale - even if it was being a bit irritable with their family when they got home.
1,1659,217,1605,we are all his munchkins!!!!
1,1660,267,1606,With the very rigourous process that you were required to undertake, was this a realistic risk?  Knowing that you weren&#039;t currently vaccinated, if the risk were higher than I believe it was why did you go ahead an work in the environment?
1,1661,253,1655,Agree. He didn&#039;t speak to BTP Officer other than the one on the London Resiliance Team.
1,1662,261,1641,That the job was done well despite lack of training of most of the officers who were dealing and that this must be rectified through having fully trained and prepared officers for any eventuality like this.
1,1663,255,1616,Aren&#039;t they part of our Royal Family
1,1664,245,1564,team leaders were on the whole very good one city leader was not and would suggest that people be sellected on the role they can perform not because they are sgts
1,1665,265,1626,yes i agree
1,1666,270,1641,Body Recovery and DVI / Mortuary training is essential.
1,1667,217,1641,PLEASE let&#039;s have the training. let&#039;s have the confidence to do this ourselves. we&#039;ve proved we can, so why not?
1,1668,224,1564,i was over supervised with 2 DCI&#039;s and a DS they were a good bunch.
1,1669,269,1530,I would have liked one BTP senior officer to be a point of contact for all BTP at the mortuary. There were BTP from 3 area&#039;s and various departments within those area&#039;s. There was confusion as to who should be contacted re descisions on things like pay, accomodation and expenses.
1,1670,210,1471,i had no problems with any of the met officers i had dealings with.
1,1671,263,1572,A bit unfair - senior ranks understood the position we were putting officers in and the difficult work being undertaken.  our staff needed to see senior ranks asap - and senior ranks wanted to get an understanding of the problems and conditions, however in the first couple of days we were requested not to attend by MPS at the mortuary
1,1672,267,1633,Being sent and staying are two different things.  In this situation, it would have been a brave manager who had told anyone who said they didn&#039;t want to be there to say or else
1,1673,226,1641,BTP should take a great amount of encouragement and enthusiasm and understand the importance of having it&#039;s own DVI team.  The area commander seems to be in agreement, lets hope that FHQ and the CC agree.
1,1674,262,1588,How long does it take before the troops on the ground benifit from such an event other then those sitting a miliion miles away  from the task in hand who claim all the glory from those at the other end of the stick . In benifit i mean DVI or other related courses. We only have to look at what has happened over the pond in the States to see how we could help out.  We seem to like the idea of promoting such issues as L91 and such like to agencies from around the world, but not in paying for a course that could be done in house given a little bit of foresight from the senior managment team.
1,1675,218,1641,All the knowledge that was gained by all the officers experiences must not be lost. All of the officers concerned in the mortuary learnt how to becove DVI officers, others learning how to run a mortuary, all on the job. Why not give them formal training?
1,1676,253,1639,agree
1,1677,224,1595,in this day of hiring the ex met officers can we not head hunt him for ourselves he could replace a number of our management.
1,1678,265,1574,I think this brings us back to the polint that nobody initailly knew what the duties were - and by then it was too late
1,1679,267,1672,stay or else - makes more sense!
1,1680,221,1648,i recieved a less than friendly phone call from above asking why i was not on static post at a mainline station that day i asked how i would possibly be able to cover the mortuary as well, i know there is multi tasking but....
1,1681,245,1641,let those now trained be part of the national and international relief effort if required in the future. this requires regular assesment and  training, even if it does not effect the Railway as in the past.
1,1682,261,1641,Fact of the matter is that eventually another train crash will happen and if BTP do not take the opportunity to build and gain from this tragedy then we will have to go elsewhere and ask for assistance as usual.
1,1683,217,1641,BTP have proved they have the right calibre of people, and that those people have the correct approach required to deal with incidents such as these. the profile of the force has been raised considerably since 7/7. BTP must learn to take advantage of this and to capitalise on the successes of a tragic incident
1,1684,270,1478,A welfare call home from a Senior Officer (even an Inspector) to wives at home would have been a good touch!
1,1685,269,1595,DCI Williams was inspirational, he was a natural leader. I am proud to have had the opportunity to work for him.
1,1686,212,1641,a big question, is the BTP a learning Force. if it is it really should recognise the efforts put in by its Officers and seek therir views from an ACPO level. we need support in recognising that we now have a DVI team and that we need to be put onto the National list and assist us in ongoing training, and support opportunities for us to use our skills in the future, even if the circumstances do not affect the Railway
1,1687,242,1530,It&#039;s all about respect and the old saying you can&#039;t do enough for a good gonenor. Unfortunately a lot of our inspectors and above have been promoted without enough experience and punch above thier weight. They have not got their hands dirty and display little supervisory skills and petty mindedness, prefering instead to tick a few boxes for the next rank. In a small force such as ours we cant afford this situation.
1,1688,223,1530,I worked along side the met DS direct to DCI Williams.They were spot on with their attitudes and gave myself credit to act as a part of the team organising individual projects to ensure that resources were available to all the teams within the mortuary.Initially BTP didn&#039;t seem to have a focal point of contact but that was later resolved.
1,1689,222,1669,there was a chief inspector and civilian who when not on site were available by phone and would sort any problems from accom to clothing even o/t payments
1,1690,260,1641,so we could have coped then without the Met &quot;lending&quot; us a hand.NOT
1,1691,224,1622,they were too busy in their nice new counting house, counting all their money and looking to see where they could reap from the operation to cover their own short fall in budget.
1,1692,209,1686,Does this mean international disasters
1,1693,267,1678,but on realising that first pang of realisation would allow you to formulate an opinion - then I appreciate all sorts of other things take over, about team spirit etc.  Very difficult I know, but no one was forced to go or stay at the mortuary, although it reads as though a few felt they were
1,1694,214,1414,The fact that BTP officers not only stood up to be counted (they always do) but that they received this recognition on a world wide stage and have raised the profile and standing of the Force so much. I consider it an honour to work with people that did such a fantastic job
1,1695,269,1668,Perhaps you needed it!
1,1696,226,1641,I spoke with a number of DVI trainers who have said that they will not charge the BTP for the course all they ask for is a class room and there accomodation paid for, stop being tight with the purse strings and untie the red tape.  Too much politics and brass trying to have a slice of the cake.  We have the experience lets use it to good effect!
1,1697,270,1682,Absolutely agree - We need the training NOW to ensure the skills learned and collected by our officers at the mortuary are not forgotten
1,1698,253,1685,Amazing someone tells a joke, wears a different pair of socks each day as a talking point, and suddenly becomes an inspirational leader. He was good,however how often did he talk to BTP or his own men outside of the entertaining briefings?
1,1699,265,1634,did he know who you were?
1,1700,218,1682,Even during training we were told it is not a matter of IF but WHEN!!!!
1,1701,253,1635,He paid well, that was what made us work so well
1,1702,245,1641,we have proved to other forces (mps) and government that the BTP can assist with all areas of policing and recovery not just one unders. the btp must committ to the use of these officers should their help be requested in the future. we are all on the same side.
1,1703,211,1666,agree, sole BTP DVI trained officer can conduct and arrange such training
1,1704,270,1641,After all the Train Crashes and other incidents the BTP have responded to and dealt with so well it should be US offering training to other police forces!
1,1705,212,1692,Yes, it does. we have to start looking at the bigger picture, especially if we want to promote ourselves as a Professional Police Force
1,1706,267,1637,What do you mean by plagued?  As they requesting to see or speak to you, to ensure that you have gone through their evaluation process and you haven&#039;t yet taken up their offer to do so, cause they wont stop aproaching you until you submit to their reuest for an evaluation, or have you been seen nd this is just BTP incompetence of not stricking you off their list as seen?
1,1707,262,1641,Looking at the core skills aquired by its officers and not thinking of the purse strings. We need to come into line with other forces in relation to these sort of events and not stay in the dark ages. The bombings have proved that we need to be more proactive in regards to policing the railways and look at other ways forward, ie ARMED Response officers on the networks.
1,1708,258,1530,It took over 24 hours from the the time of the explosions before the issue of who was going to pay for officers overtime to be settled. Officers detailed to carry out duties were given conflicting advice as to whether they could actually work.<br />Are there agreements laid out to cover National Emergencies like this?
1,1709,261,1690,Of course not and neither could the Met as proved by our involvement and City and Hearts Pol. But the fact was three of the four crime scenes were on our patch.
1,1710,245,1641,do not let the skills slip so if something happens in the future we will not be sending in other officers blind. TRAINING...
1,1711,270,1703,Yes we have the knowledge within force to do this training.
1,1712,214,1641,I think all the comments are well made and need to be given serious consideration. Hopefully that is what the debrief outcomes will enable us to do.
1,1713,242,1641,To treat officers who are doing a difficult job such as the DVI teams like adults
1,1714,263,1641,The names of officers who worked at the mortuary and are now fully trained in DVI must be held in a readly available format (i.t system) in order that we can deploy in the future and not waste the skills acquired. Further officers should also be trained in DVI.
1,1715,245,1707,Railway with guns????
1,1716,269,1689,Thats nice to know now who are they?
1,1717,253,1641,That the BTP should have it&#039;s own DVI Team resource, we have the foundation of that team in this room, what better resource than those with practical experiencegained through episodic learning. This should be formalised and BTP should be proud to have such a experienced resource within its own ranks. Managers should value this and not see it as a threat to have BTP work alongside the Met
1,1718,224,1689,they drew the short straw unfortunately for them, however, they pulled through and did alright for us
1,1719,242,1683,I&#039;m in total agreement
1,1720,210,1641,we must continue to build our skills by further assistance to other forces and through training/courses.
1,1721,218,1690,No we could not have coped! But untrained BTP officers proved that we can all work as a team with other forces and learn (not only MPS, there were Hants DVI officers at Edgware Road) in a manner that the CC would be proud.
1,1722,267,1582,Was the lack of an on site senior BTP officer present a contribution to this feeling of being cut off?
1,1723,223,1654,There was a lot of outside interference from this individual more concerend about resources for static patrols.Does he understand the fact that we put ourselves out working long hours doing a stressfull enough job ,without having to contend with phone calls from our beat up sgts telling us that we were supposed to be working a night shift somewhere!
1,1724,212,1690,a very negative view, this type of scenario cannot be dealt with by one Force
1,1725,221,1703,then take a list of those people who attended and use it to best advantage before everyone forgets us . unless they already have a list of those officers
1,1726,261,1715,Scary thought!
1,1727,270,1452,Hear Hear
1,1728,253,1707,Failure to address this issue will be the end of the BTP, as the Met might as well carry on policing the system
2,1729,0,0,Personal messages to the Chief and his team
1,1730,267,1607,How does this correlate with the &quot;complaints to Force&quot; of working many days without time off?
1,1731,226,1702,I have spoken to number of officers (in soecialised roles) and when asked what I done on the bombings I explained Mortuary duties.  They looked at me in a sense of envy and disgust that they should have been doing it instead.
1,1732,262,1471,A shame that some officers made such coments, however BTP came through it all with flying colours. With such big events a small group who think they have been left out will always maken such soft remarks.
1,1733,264,1641,It must realise that there is more to Policing than prisioners and crime stats. We have a responsibility to the people we serve to be the best we can. If our ACPO showed the same level of committment as the chaps i worked with in the mortuary things would be rosy.Training is essential and must be structured from FHQ. Areas will not support a DVI response and training programme unless pushed. We should learn to see policing as policing UK and not be so parochial. Some officers from London South were going to be pulled out of the Mortuary team because of a lack of budget to pay overtime.
1,1734,221,1682,so lets get the list of officers capable up and running now
1,1735,245,1710,in the past most incidents involving large scale deaths have occurred on BTP property (including 7/7) we have had to depend on met and locals for DVI and ort duties. not good enough. we now have officers who can perform these functions lets keep them trained and included on national database and use the skills we have
1,1736,258,1641,What happens when the next incident, terrorist or otherwise, occurrs in a small county constabulary &amp; team Met does not roll into town. We have to plan our own BTP response to meet such a challenge
1,1737,269,1641,It is a credit to this force that the officers deployed to the tempoary mortuary performed so well without any training. For the officers on the DVI teams it was presumed that they had undergone formal training when in fact they had not. Yet again it is the rank and file that fly the flag for this organisation.
1,1738,270,1729,Although these were posted on the BTP intranet - surelymanagement knew that we did not have access to the intranet at the mortuary!!!!!!
1,1739,214,1441,Yes this was an awesome piece of work and the author has been thanked. This together with other presentations has been given over the last two days to a group of European Transport Police senior officers. They could not stop praising BTP for what he has been doing. They have asked to form a joint working group so they can learn from the skills and experience of all of the staff that made all this happen.
1,1740,261,1724,I absolutely agree, one force alone cannot deal with this type of incident alone but if BTP wants to be considered a grown up and professional force it needs to be able to pull it&#039;s weight with providing adequately trained people.
1,1741,217,1729,please do not ignore anything in this debrief. we served you well, please take the oportunity to further increase the profile of BTP
1,1742,212,1712,only if the powers that be see this type of report and take time to read it, it may be easier if they took the time out and spoke to us face to face so none of the very important issues raised here are missed. Needs to be ACPO level as these are the people who can make the right decisions
1,1743,255,1641,Quite simple, make sure the guv&#039;nors read all these statements and then test them to make sure they have
1,1744,218,1729,We really do need DVI (formaly trained) officers. It would be a great resource for a national police force.
1,1745,260,1720,Agreed.We can only get better if were given the experience.You can train for ever but come the real thing...........
1,1746,210,1683,we must start to promote our force as equal and the best way would be to fully train officers in these necessary skills.
1,1747,265,1724,absolutely big events planned or unplanned are viewed &#039;pan london&#039; response
1,1748,270,1524,It would have been useful to have access to BTP Computer systems at the Mortuary to check emails and see what else was going on. Met had access to their aware system
1,1749,253,1729,You have a trained resource that have aquitted themselves creditably as DVI Officers. We should be leading this issue not the poor relations, after Hatfield, Ladbroke Grove, Southall, and 7/7 BTP should have learnt by now not to rely on Home Office Forces, and only to make a token effort to assisting on scene. The Officers at the mortuary have experience and should be listed in case of future occurances.
1,1750,245,1717,Det Supt Carroll attended the mortuary and stated that the BTP have a trianed DVI team now. This is true but training needs to be current and up to date to use them in the future
1,1751,224,1729,hire graham williams immediately, and most of the management he worked with. Give us the training we require and the opportunity to use it. I am sick of playing 2nd fiddle to the other forces, we have proved we can do the job we are paid for.
1,1752,222,1729,the force is moving in the right direction, however now is the time to further train and learn from the bombings as i fear this will not be the last
1,1753,270,1751,Give Graham Williams a job
1,1754,255,1729,Do you now intend to develop and nuture the skills obtained or just bin them
1,1755,214,1729,the debrief will not be ignored, there can be no guarantees as to when or how the lessons will be implemented but there is a willingness and a desire to ensure we build on the learning
1,1756,218,1753,Seconded
1,1757,217,1724,so we let things contnue the way they are?
1,1758,245,1753,we can learn a great deal in man management from him
1,1759,242,1530,The rank and file once again fly the flag for the BTP. Our bosses must seek to raise the profile of this force and not be bullied by the big boys from the MET.
1,1760,262,1729,Many thanks for being given the chance to work within this inviroment. Although i volountered for this tour of duty i never thought that i would be asked to attend given my lack of knowledge and experiance in this field of work. Do not let the hard work of all those officers fall to the wayside becuase of finacial implications. I&#039;m sure that having been supplied wth extra shreddies and socks we could push the boat out and get the courses sorted.
1,1761,217,1755,this sounds both encouraging and hopeful
1,1762,270,1729,Acknowledge the work done by ALL of your officers. Dont allow the skills they have learned to be lost.
1,1763,212,1755,this is good to hear, but is it just to pacify us in the short term in the vain hope that we go away
1,1764,214,1738,a fair point but everyone was doing their best and this was a gap in the way the information was shared - definately one to remember in another major incident!
1,1765,245,1755,I do hope not
1,1766,265,1729,note the comments regarding London South management (or lack of it) and also guard against L area &#039;going native&#039;
1,1767,261,1729,We are a national force and we need dedicated resources as part of that. If a train crashe happens in Scotland we should be able to provide some of the key resources at least.
1,1768,211,1690,The whole of the Met Police DVI team (21 MPS and 1 BTP) was deployed on 7/7 if another incident occurred, DVI teams from dorset and hants were on standby to assist so every force has its limits. Under train searches were conducted by West Mids Police, so there was multi force approach to this whole operation
1,1769,269,1729,I can not think of another UK police force that should have a DVI capability as much as the BTP. History shows that we deal with major incidents nationwide (train crashes / terrorist incidents). The capability to send a DVI team anywhere in the country would be a great achievment for this force. It would enhance our reputaion with other forces and the public and would cost very little to put in place.
1,1770,253,1703,Why should someone who has attended the briefest of training cascade this knowledge to others, when he is not trained in training. There is a wealth of practical experience available now.<br />Will a course make that much difference. Was the sole trained DVI officer the best reource in the mortuary - no. We were a team, sure the training in advance would have helped, but nothing beats hands on doing the job, and by goodness we did it!
1,1771,217,1753,then he can be our munchkin!!!!!!!!
1,1772,260,1760,Ill give my shreddies back if it helps
1,1773,223,1641,I feel that BTP should stand up and proudly shout about the good work that all its officers achieved from this.Have the gile to demand and put into place training for a BTP DVI team.Have a resource team who know exactly who has what skils and how to place them direct.I would hope that the officers that have been used and worked on THEASUS well , providing that they want to ,would be on a strategic list to be first called again.Maybe a list should be in place somewhere.
1,1774,211,1690,last entry should show 51 not 21 MPS and 1 BTP
1,1775,261,1772,Me too.
1,1776,262,1772,So will i.
1,1777,226,1729,I was told that BTP will listen to what we have to say.  What I want say I will say to the faces of the people that matter i.e.  Area Commander, Chief Constable&#039;s.  They should be visiting the officers involved in the mortuary and asking their views of whats needed.
1,1778,217,1772,you&#039;ll have to take them off your head!!!!
1,1779,269,1772,I won&#039;t
1,1780,245,1767,we now have the so called CDU and major teams mis etc it is time for a DVI/mort standby team for rail crash and or acts of terror
1,1781,270,1729,We are proud of our force and acknowledge the huge changes you have made but we need to show and boast that we are the best force for dealing with disasters. Lets have a fully trained and properly led DVI team. You know it makes sense.
1,1782,221,1729,i feel that you should place an emergancy call up list of officers that remain dedicated to do btp proud
1,1783,255,1753,Isn&#039;t he too young
1,1784,217,1779,okay
1,1785,253,1703,Who is the sole trained DVI Officer? No one seemed to be trained before we went in there, certainly no one seemed to have more knowledge than anyone else
1,1786,264,1729,Please do not be so blinkered to believe everything you are told by others. Remember the story of The Emperor&#039;s new clothes.You may find it intersting to speak to the practitioners of policing not the theorists.
1,1787,217,1753,i keep getting munchkins confused with oompahloompahs - which ones are what
1,1788,223,1750,this team i am sure could be added to with members here today
1,1789,270,1766,Lack of any London South Management was noticable
1,1790,242,1729,Can i have the day of next Thursday
1,1791,214,1763,after 29 years if BTP officers can be pacified about something they believe in it will be a first! We need to get all of the ideas, concerns and comments from all the debriefs and try and prioritise them
1,1792,255,1772,I don&#039;t wear any
1,1793,263,1729,The skills that our officers have or have obtained as a result of 7/7 must not be lost. we need I.T systems that capture All skills and can be easily interrogated. The size of occ health needs reviewing and what support is available outside at short notice. A logistics dept should be established to deal with officers needs/requirements - one phone number etc. Training particularly around disasters should be reviewed - we should not commit untrained officers to critical events. The gaps in our response needs looking at, ie, DVI/ no firearms capability - the lack of capability could be used against us.
1,1794,212,1729,The duties we carried were unpleasant to put it politely, there has been various suggestions on how you will show your thanks to us for what we had to endure, could it please be explained as to us as to your proposals and or decisions
1,1795,226,1772,I didn&#039;t get any......Got a nice fleece though
1,1796,261,1772,Thank you for being allowed to contribute to the biggest terrorist operation of it&#039;s kind and please show your appreciation by allowing us to build on this.
1,1797,265,1729,History shows that the force often fails to learn by experience a robust managemnt system is needed to ensure that action points are moved on in every department
1,1798,261,1795,At least you got one.
1,1799,269,1787,oompahloompahs have got brains munchkins have got muscle
1,1800,214,1790,only if you submit in triplicate and find someone to cover your shift!
1,1801,226,1798,One I got two different colours aswell.  Want one
1,1802,217,1787,how does the song go - I dare you!!!!!
1,1803,245,1729,this has been the proudest moment of my career to have helped and be part of this. please do not allow the work to be wasted by not aslowing us to remain trianed and ready to work
1,1804,224,1766,see previous comment about them in their counting house, I still have yet to be spoken to by our DCI, perhaps he feels suitably embarrassed. And so he should
1,1805,253,1780,Please don&#039;t associate the work we did with the CDU or whatever they are now called.
1,1806,245,1790,no
1,1807,260,1769,why stay with  the uk.GAINING EXPERIENCE IS EVERYTHING
1,1808,226,1805,The generals dept
1,1809,245,1729,where were the BTP soco?
1,1810,262,1414,The CHUCKLE BROTHERS from West Ham were an absoloute must have. They should be in post for similar events.
1,1811,261,1729,Sir, allow us to develop as a force by investing in training the resources who have had first hand experience and aquitted themselves well.
1,1812,223,1810,Plus The hounarable two CHUCKS
1,1813,261,1729,Remind some area officers that the force is more important than their own careers.
1,1814,262,1729,A sincere message from Mr Robb, many thanks. Lets hope we gain from this.

1,1905,336,1900,Some idea of the set up of the centre - who would be there and what was expected of us- where we were going
1,1906,317,1900,To be treated like we were worth while officers - not just pink and soft........
1,1907,326,1900,A BREIFING! Someone who knew what was going to happened (or pretend) someone to take charge and give reassurance. But most importantly INFORMATION!!!!!!
1,1908,315,1900,More information about what we were supposed to be doing-what was expected of us ,what we were going into.I didn&#039;t feel prepared
2,16838,4186,0,What needs to be done to ensure that the strategic priorities become/remain realities?
1,1910,317,1900,INFORMATION INFORMATION INFORMATION
1,1911,319,1900,Just information, we were being spoken to by family members who knew an awful lot more of what was going on than we did. It was embarassing!
1,1912,335,1900,All the available information about the incident. What had happened, what had been done so far and what was being done at the time.
1,1913,314,1900,More information as to what, why and how we were hoping to achieve. Full info as regards the ID Commission to breif FLO&#039;s and therfore families.
1,1914,304,1907,what information would you have liked
1,1915,326,1910,Here Here!
1,1916,331,1900,We kenw we were going to be seeing people that had been searching hospitals for loved ones - would have liked to have more information on the set-up our processes what did the organisation ie MPS know
1,1917,328,1900,more information about our role. how many people were expected.
1,1918,317,1900,the facts not information from the press
1,1919,313,1900,System should have been implemented earlier-as a consequence more time and info to produce a structured briefing pack.
1,1920,332,1900,information about the incident who was where and what was being done to find the victims
1,1921,334,1900,Although i did not attend the intitial breifing i would have liked to see somebody with flo knowledge to address the persons with their thoughts of what we should expect. What forms to fill and as much info as possible .
1,1922,312,1900,Clear concise information so that we could focus staff on the core role and eliminate initial confusion
1,1923,316,1900,To have been informed that it was going to be an attachment away from borough for a length of time. That it was going to be an Assistance Centre rather than working with 1 family.
1,1924,311,1900,Wish we had been given all the info available as the media and families knew more than us.
1,1925,326,1914,Information to give to the families we could not tell them anything! THis made us feel useless and stupid
1,1926,309,1900,We have known for some time that we would be victims of a major incident and I feel that the skeleton format for the setting up and running of such a centre should have already been in existance and this would have facilitated a much smoother, and more organised start.
1,1927,317,1906,thats all some people see FLO&#039;s as!!
1,1928,332,1900,relatives and friends needed a one to one to discuss what they required.  most had telephoned cas bureau repeatedly and not knowing what this was for felt completely let down by the information being given out
1,1929,329,1900,A full and proper briefing.  The powers that be had had two days to sort everything out.  It was a real rush job and everyone was running around patting evryone on the back about what they had done in such a short space of time.  A pity it had to be so rushed.  The pats on the back should have been to the FLO&#039;s who made it work not the people who organised the settees.  Families on those first days were not concerned about the decorations and furniture.  They wanted help and they got it.  A very distressing time for everyone involved.
1,1930,322,1900,Information about the location of the incidents - to make clearer  the significance of the last known location of the people that were being sought.
1,1931,321,1900,A better location for a briefing with seats for all, some one to be there when we arrive. A typed front sheet of our Aims, objectives and location, with how to get to the Queens Mothers Sports Centre.A bit more information from the investigating team. Contact list made up of everyone and handed round.
1,1932,336,1911,At one point no one appeared to know if there were any unidentified living casualties - I was given different information from various sources and felt totally unproffessional when I could not convey up to date information to families sho were clinging to the hope that their relatives could be still alive and unidentified
1,1933,331,1926,as well as a quicker response
1,1934,319,1929,Totally agree with that
1,1935,326,1928,plus the number for CB was wrong and one of the numbers was for some poor member of the public that kept being rang!
1,1936,312,1913,This info was vital on initial contact with families, staff were also not clear on the need to implement MIR procedures at the FAC. Done eventually!
1,1937,332,1911,I agree that at some points we were given differing information and our whole ethos about being truthful
2,1938,0,0,What difficulites did you have to overcome
2,1939,0,0,What am I personally most proud about
1,1940,317,1911,I agree,I was embarassed to give some families information when they knew more then me
1,1941,312,1906,Lack of Knowledge at SMT level about FLO role
1,1942,321,1916,There should already have been a procdure to put in place FLO&#039;s, not wait for the PM to say sort it out! We were forgotten about after the initial incident.
1,1943,332,1939,that i contributed in some small way to alleviate the pain suffered by victims and relatives
1,1944,331,1939,every person/family that I dealt with left in a more positive manner than when they arrived regardless of how much true information I was/was not able to provide them with
1,1945,317,1939,I acted with professionlism and showed families I was human too -
1,1946,332,1939,I am very proud that despite having a lack of information that I was able to be professional caring and respectful to those families I spoke to and they appreciated all that I had done
1,1947,309,1939,I felt an enormous satisfaction that every visitor  I spoke to at the centre left feling better than when they walked in.
1,1948,315,1939,dont really feel proud about anything,we were doing a job we get paid for,doing what is expected of us.
1,1949,336,1939,I developed a great rapport with other agencies at the Red Cross and felt that the work of FLO&#039;s was brought to the attention of them - they were very impressed with the professionalism of us
1,1950,331,1939,being a member of a group of professionals that dealt with the families of such a tragic event and devloping my FLO experience
1,1951,319,1939,I&#039;m extremely proud, that i was put of the largest investigation the &quot;Met&quot; has even undertaken.<br />I think everyone i dealt with at the centre left slightly happier than when they arrived.
1,1952,317,1939,Everyone I dealt with I believed went away feeling I had given them something
1,1953,332,1939,I am proud that although it was very disorganised at first, we as FLOs made it work, we were a team and worked well together
1,1954,328,1939,Playing a small role in a major incident
1,1955,335,1939,Being able to be part of it and to deal with it making me a stronger person.
1,1956,326,1939,I am proud to be a FLO working for The Metropolitan Police for London. I am proud to be working along great professional and caring police officers and to work with the support agencies. It was great satisfaction when the surviors left feeling a bit better and that you had contributed to that. It was nice to meet lots of different people
1,1957,329,1939,I think I really helped some of the families I spoke to.  I was on occasions obstructed by the bureaoracy of the FLC&#039;s at Hendon.  They were sat in an office and had no contact with the victims &#039;families&#039; and made rash unfeeling decisions that would affect those bereaved for the rest of their lives.  I tried my best to make those terrible decisions better for the families.
1,1958,317,1948,yes but I beleive you have to be the right type of person and if thats how you feel should you really be an FLO!
1,1959,319,1939,I worked with and met some outstanding police collegues, including officers from other forces!
1,1960,321,1939,A sense of contribution and involvement. That I was actually able to help people that had lost their loved ones. That I knew that I had to just get on with it, and be prepared to deal with anything that came through the door with the little amount of experience and details that I had. Trying to make the best of the situation and not making things hard work. Being prepared to challenge SMT about issues in a group of people that I didn&#039;t know.
1,1961,316,1939,To have been a small part of a huge response.
1,1962,334,1939,That i was able to help and have some contact with victims and their families. Also one time talking to a family member about whether he should view the body of his relative and feeling as though he took my thoughts and ideas with him to make his decision. .
1,1963,314,1939,On seeing all of the FLO&#039;s brought together at very short notice with really no briefing pull together and work for the VIP&#039;s, the families, it was I found a very humbling experience. The willingness and enthusiasm of all concerned at the coal face was commendable.
1,1964,326,1958,did you not feel that you helped anyone?
1,1965,329,1939,We made it work.  I m very proud of that.  It was hard and draining but very worthwhile.  I met people at their lowest ebb who I will not forget in along while.
1,1966,319,1963,Totally agree with that, well said
1,1967,312,1939,That I worked with a group of fantastic FLO officers, that did the job and kept smiling. Also that the families left the FAC saying thank you and that despite very little information we had moved them forward. Personally I got a great sense of job satsfaction meeting the challenge.
1,1968,332,1939,the very fact that all of us wanted to help - despite everything else going on in our own lives - we wanted to do our bit
1,1969,313,1939,Ensuring that the uninformed person(s) at the end of the job,were astounded by the sheer proffessionalism,dedication of family laision officers.<br />The same people realising the huge benefits of family liaison - from an investiagtive side as well as a family side.<br />Senior management also understanding the above
1,1970,317,1950,I was proud to work for the MET and show we could all pull together, at times a very difficult job but I believed we did it well
1,1971,331,1963,qutie agree we had a fantastic team at the FAC that in true job style just got on with what we needed to do
1,1972,315,1964,do you do the job to get a pat on the back to make you feel good- I thought it was to help the families.
1,1973,334,1953,i enjoyed working with many of the flo&#039;s at the centre and think we made a great team.
1,1974,321,1965,I&#039;m sure they will not forget you, we play an important role in their lifes at that time.
1,1975,329,1948,That is very sad.  You should be proud of the work you did.  In this type of situation it is not about money.  For goodness sake, people lost their lives!  Have some compassion or go back to borough and get a desk job in the duties!
1,1976,316,1953,Wholeheartedly agree! It would never have been as successful without us! It was US that it made it work, not the heirarchy.
1,1977,331,1956,I feel likewise. It is a great role to and one of imeasurable importance. I am very proud to be able to say I am a Family Liaison Officer.
1,1978,311,1939,Getting on an underground train so soon after the bombing!<br />Also... not knowing what my role would be at the family assistance centre, being able to adapt myself into it. The first family i saw had clearly lost their mother. They were distraught and angry aimed at me and my colleague. I felt that despite no information what so ever when they left some hours later, they were calmer and had a better understanding of the difficulties wew were in. Some time later my colleague attended a memorial with that family. They apologised for being angry at us and thanked us for our support on day one!
1,1979,328,1947,We helped many people , many that woud not normaly have had contact with the Police.
1,1980,336,1952,I felt that even though most of the time we could not give the relatives good news they went away at last feeling they had some contact from police and that someone had listened to themand tried to get as much information to them as possible
1,1981,334,1977,I t was one of my first experiences as an flo and am very pleased to have been part of the team.
1,1982,317,1975,completely agree, we did a great job and I certainly feel proud to be an FLO
1,1983,329,1963,Well said.  I have never worked in a better team.
1,1984,321,1967,Everyone seemed to pull together, having not met each oher and with very limited knowledge of each others skills and experience. We did well.
1,1985,336,1976,I agree I got really fed up with people who had no contact with the public who seemed to be wanting a pat on the back for the admin in setting up the centre
1,1986,316,1947,I have bumped into somone I dealt with since and he told me that his view of he police has changed since. He now has more understanding of the types of things we have to deal with.
1,1987,321,1954,Small, but extremely vital role!
1,1988,319,1945,Being able to &quot;cry&quot; too. The family day on the Sunday, I cried my eyes out!
1,1989,329,1939,I learnt so much about myself and general human nature and kindness.  It was a fantastic experience.
1,1990,332,1978,I agree.  I have never travelled on the tube as much as after this event - it makes you think of yourself, but overriding this is being able to do your bit for others.
1,1991,313,1957,FLCs at Hendon should be supportive around our needs and accept and understand the difference in your deployment to that of dedicated deployment to the family<br />balancing that some decisions- were by necessity harsh
1,1992,312,1957,In a situation when we are all working under pressure I think some of the people of the end of the phone forgot they were talking to another human being in an equally demanding role
1,1993,321,1944,They wanted someone just to care, help and give them info.
1,1994,331,1978,Yep I got on the tube that saturday night - and I felt amazingly self concious

1,1996,317,1995,was this the right name!!!
1,1997,316,1995,Incorrectly named.
1,1998,338,1995,Wrong name.  Not just for families.  Define families.  Not every family is the middle class stereotype of Thatchers Britain.
1,1999,334,1995,Why was there not a front page advert inevery paper telling people where it was and what it was for?
1,2000,332,1995,this should have been part of any policing plan for any major incident and implement asap for the families/relatives/friends
1,2001,331,1995,we were unclear about what the other agencies could offer...... VSS we all know about but TFL were fantastic with what they could offer
1,2002,335,1995,To include friends.
1,2003,328,1995,It should not have been called Family Assistance Centre. People who needed help did not attend until later thinking that it was only for families.
1,2004,309,1995,The title says it all, this was the wrong name as other people involved in the incident thought it wasn&#039;t aimed at them, they thought that it was only for bereaved and their families.
1,2005,334,1996,no
1,2006,313,1995,Clear defined roles and responsibilities of the other agencies-<br />multi - agency briefing
1,2007,309,1995,lessons from tha FAC at 9/11 were not learned.
1,2008,312,1995,Clearly define ground rules this is a criminal investigation attending the centre assists the investigation and provides families with information.
1,2009,322,1995,Poorly advertised - could information have been put out at the location of the incidents, hospitals, major stations etc
1,2010,313,1995,poor media marketing of the centre
1,2011,326,1995,Gave the impression it was only for families. People more concerned over what it looked like not what it was about! Food rubbish (apart from the carrot cake) friction with westminster council - who was running the joint?! Not advertised, we could of helped alot more people! Did not know anything about the other agencies.
1,2012,338,1995,Is it true that this was set up at the whim of the PM.  I felt it was something that Senior Management wanted to fail so that they would not have to do it again.  They failed we succeeded.  It worked and will definately have to be used again.
1,2013,315,1995,was set up in a hurry, it wasn&#039;t publicised well enough
1,2014,319,1995,The location was good, the interior was wonderful. The bright and airy interior was excellent.
1,2015,331,1995,Why didn&#039;t DAC Clarke advertise the FAC when he gave the most prominant interview on the main news the second day. It would have also shown what the Police were doing for victims as well as the investigation !!!!!!
1,2016,332,1995,it is a police led response to a major incident - we should have had clear responsibility for setting it up and what it contained
1,2017,331,2007,which are ?
1,2018,313,2010,central government being unsure of the principles around the FAC
1,2019,334,1995,The multi agencies were great,hurray for TFL  and their cabs and hotels .
1,2020,314,1995,Should be a one stop shop for families the families should not ahve to go anywhere else in London to assist them in their greatest time of need.<br />Death certification.<br />Info on Identification of their relative.<br />Info on body release
1,2021,336,1995,A great idea - a single point of contact for families, witnesses and victims but needs to be set up asap not two days later.  People need info asap not to be wandering from point to point for days.  We are all now experienced in working in the FAC and there should be a entral list that when there is next a major incident we can be called direct or we can ring in and offer our assist - a centrecould then be set up within hours and be up and running .  Experienced staff are needed
1,2022,312,1995,support services should have been briefed re police investigation needs and role of flo
1,2023,322,1995,Poor liason between the FAC and Casualty Bureau.
2,2024,0,0,If the profession of Family Liaison is a learning profession, what learning must we take forward from our experience
1,2025,313,2010,should not have been a 24 hrs cntre..
1,2026,309,1995,Publicity a big issue.  Red Cross had to pay for some advertising space in the media, some was also offered free, however it was to be found on Pages near the rear of newspapers not where all the coverage of the bombing was.
1,2027,338,1995,The first centre QE Sports Hall was dreadful.  The second FAC at the RHH was brilliant.  Every family member that came away said they had be helped by the Police and other agencies.
1,2028,335,1999,Headline on the news.
1,2029,334,2025,why
1,2030,338,1995,Why wasn&#039;t it advertised better advertised.
1,2031,331,2023,totally agree - we were being given information that differed from minute to minute depending on who you spoke to
1,2032,319,2019,I did feel a couple of times though, TFL did get a little bit &quot;penny pinching&quot; over people getting taxi&#039;s home.
1,2033,322,2023,Incorrect phone numbers given. Inaccurate or minimal information received from doing computer checks later.
1,2034,313,2015,To focused on investigative needs (shrouded by secrecy-excuse)family needs as a consequence suffered-lack of information,etc
1,2035,311,1995,I was employed to the FAC on the day it opened.Families and friends were attending in the hope of finding their relatives alive. Although i see the purpose of bereavement agencies as important, i did not feel that it was appropriate for them to be as visable as they were. It gave the families the opinion that their loved ones were already dead. There was a need for private comfortable rooms for families who were waiting for news.
1,2036,309,2017,I will be guided by those that attended NY at the time and are fully versed in the triumphs and mistkes of that particular centre.
1,2037,332,2023,the families did not know what casualty bureau was for and would keep ringing and ringing them.  they felt we should have been dealing with this, but we were not set up in time.  time and again, families were saying they were getting no info from them, but when we explained their role they understood - again this information needs to be relayed to the public at the outset, at the same time as an Assistance Centre is set up
1,2038,334,2024,That with the right location and personnel it can be set up with in a matter of hours of any disaster or incident
1,2039,338,1995,Certain FLO&#039;s working with families didn&#039;t even know about the FAC.  I was even asked by one &#039;Are you a FLO?&#039; when trying to sort out a problem.  I think we were a vital resource to the families and we should have been advertised more.
1,2040,316,1995,A Centre is absolutely vital should, god forbid, another incident occur. I hope now that there is a full blue print on how it should be run so that there are no delays.
1,2041,317,2019,TFL were fantastic and couldn&#039;t have done more for the people I dealt with
1,2042,335,1996,7/7 ASSISTANCE CENTRE
1,2043,315,2023,when we rang casualty bureau ,it did not assist in any way,they could only confirm the nominal number and how many reports on the nominal
1,2044,319,2010,I think there should have been posters adverstising the centre at the 4 different &quot;bomb&quot; sites and also all over the underground
1,2045,336,2023,I got the imrpession that no one at Casualty Bureau knew what we were or what we were doing but after a while it became apparent that flo&#039;s deployed to families had a lackof info about the centre too.  FLO&#039;s were ringing the helpline and we were telling them about the centre!!!!
1,2046,338,1995,The support line should have been sited at the same place as the FAC.  There were problems having the telephone line at the Red Cross and the FAC in another part of London.
1,2047,313,2020,not enough seemless linking to the other core sites that in effect would have provided more informattion to the families
1,2048,326,2035,Theses agencies should of been on the scene later - it was too early and they werent used until later anyway.
1,2049,322,2030,The street signs to the first FAC were adequate but those to the second were poor
1,2050,309,1995,felt we were looked at as almost second rate FLO&#039;s, by some of the FLO&#039;s appointed to families.
1,2051,313,2021,This is already in place and ready to be actioned
1,2052,312,1995,I was under the impression there was a binder on how to set up an FAC from lessons learnt in NY. Appears there wasn&#039;t
1,2053,319,1995,What about the fiasco over sending out the letters at the end, getting us to &quot;hand write&quot; evenlopes! It looked really cheap and gave the wrong impression.
1,2054,338,1995,We should be used as a resource immediatley should another incident happen.  We know how it works and have overcome the problems.  Use our experience again should it be needed.
1,2055,328,2012,The centre should of been set up earlier.
1,2056,335,2024,Whats best for the future?? Lets think now
1,2057,314,1995,Facilities for families anf FLo&#039;s to relax and eat, separately.
1,2058,338,1995,Sometimes a power struggle between Westminster Council and the Police over who was in charge.  We just got on with the job. Who cares who is in charge.  Petty squabbles haqve no place in a situation like this.
1,2059,334,2050,quite agree on that one many looked down their noses at us working at the FAC
1,2060,319,2050,I agree with that, It was like we were the B team, not good enough or trusted enough to have a family of our own.
1,2061,313,2045,agree.CCB FLO team not fully aware of FAC FLO role.
1,2062,321,1995,Timings(should have been implemented sooner with more support from the media in advertising it&#039;s excistence), there should have been already thought out plans for FLO deployment. Why hadn&#039;t this been planned with various locations, the sort of agencies that would be at these locations, with their service descriptions. A daily multi-agency briefing, including an initial brief from each head of dpt about why and what they were there for. A better entrance, not the same one that was sed by PC&#039;s, and staff wondering around. More privacy between the FLO&#039;s and various agencies. Screaming people made life alot more difficult for other family members and the FLO&#039;s. The location was not somewhere that I felt was well known. More explantion to officers at scene&#039;s and hospitals of our excistence and why they should and shouldn&#039;t send people to us(FLO already deployed and no other issues, but expected more information, this raised the family&#039;s expectations). A corporate letter for the family&#039;s of what was at the location, with agency contact numbers, and what we were there to offer, and how we could possibly help. (People cannot take in all the information or are not ready at that point to speak to the various agencies or do not realise they need the support.)
1,2063,322,1995,There was no recognised format for us collecting information about people visiting the centre. We ended up designing our own forms.
1,2064,326,1938,Working with (******)
1,2065,338,1938,Expected phone call on the 7th Didin&#039;t come until Saturday.  Anticiaption.  Wanted to help and get involved.
1,2066,338,1938,Get to NSY within the hour.  How?
1,2067,317,2064,I totally agree!!
1,2068,314,1938,Lack of transport.
1,2069,332,1938,not advertised adequately
1,2070,336,1938,Lack of information around our role
1,2071,314,1938,No information
1,2072,322,1938,Mantaining credibility when asked straightforward questions but having no basic information or means of communicating the questions to obtain a meaningfull answer.
1,2073,319,2064,I totally disagree, the bloke is a god! I&#039;d work with him anytime. ask any Essex FLO!
1,2074,338,1938,How to get to NSY.  Child care issues, cancelled plans at the last minute.  Didn&#039;t know when we would be home how long it would last.
1,2075,336,1938,Long hours and having to sort out home life although the managment were very flexible around our needs
1,2076,314,1938,No proper R &amp; R facilities for FLO&#039;s
1,2077,331,1938,Easily the most difficult problem was that we had very little information if any at all and the fact SO13 were treaing us like children. On one occassion I dealt with a family who&#039;s loved ones personal effects had been identified at the scene and was told I was NOT to release this to the family. Isn&#039;t to ethos of FLO to be honest and build trust with our families ???????
1,2078,316,1938,Working with unknown people in very difficult circumstances.
1,2079,332,1938,agenda of senior mgmt
1,2080,309,1938,Initial location; lack of information; breaking down barriers with agencies
1,2081,338,1938,Briefing.  Or lack of it.  No conference facilities.  Moving rooms.  Glad to see Ron and we knew we were in the right place.
1,2082,335,1938,Welfare issues, travelling times and working long hours.
1,2083,338,1938,We relyed on our own knowledge of events to get us through the first few days.
1,2084,338,1938,The briefing of the D/Ch Supt was pityfull.
1,2085,312,1938,little information overcome by keeping in close contact with SMT and FLA&#039;s. Also trying to keep the moral of the FLO&#039;s intact so that they were performing to optimum level.
1,2086,319,2075,Working long hours was difficult. Having to maintain a relationship with my 2 children over the period was hard.
1,2087,331,2081,Yep as soon as the great man appeared we ken we were in the right place !!!
1,2088,313,2071,SO 13 - using terrorism- as a neans to providing no information
1,2089,317,2068,When finishing at 2330 how were we supposed to get home - BIG Brass got hotels again we felt under valued
1,2090,338,1938,We needed INFORMATION, INFORMATION, INFORMATION.
1,2091,321,1938,How I would get there myself. Checking travel, would I be able to get there and get back again. Not knowing what to expect with very little information, but the attendees having a high expectation of what they wanted from us. How would I deal with the lack of information I had and not being able to answer the many questions and queries by being honest. It made us(The Police) look un organised and unprofessional.
1,2092,316,1938,Travelling to &amp; from work by tube train!
1,2093,315,2072,the FAC was set up to give people information.The first few days we didn&#039;t have any info to give ,the families were frustrated,they wanted answers and we didn&#039;t have any.
1,2094,338,1938,The FLO&#039;s and FLC&#039;s made it work.
1,2095,334,2074,The impact on my husbands role with the children and what  extra hours he had to put in at home, fortunately he wasn&#039;t too busy in his role and was able to to take on the extra duties
1,2096,326,2064,Doing FLO for the 1st time and with know breifing no knowledge of forms etc and no information. Dealing with a family that had travelled down to London for information. And on that day her husband had been identified and we had to give the death message at the centre. This was hard. The family were also angry at the lack of information we had and why it took so long for answers - they thought we were lying and hiding answers!
1,2097,314,1938,FLO welfare was paramount for me.
1,2098,313,2088,assisted to put lots of things into the too difficult box
1,2099,322,2082,I missed out on having a holiday this summer - and when I got back to my office I couldn&#039;t book the time off I wanted because everyone else had got in first.
1,2100,332,2074,I was fully supported in being able to work part time at the FAC.   Not only by Steve/Joe but by my DI.   I did long hours on the days I did work and juggling this with my childcare did make the weeks I did my FLO job hard work  but I wanted to do my bit and was quite prepared to work hard
1,2101,338,1938,There were difficulties about Meeters and Greeters handing over to the FLO&#039;s.  This was ironed out after the first day and the FLO&#039;s met there own families at the door to the FAC.
1,2102,334,2074,not seeing the children for some days was difficult for me and them.
1,2103,331,2097,I thought we looked out for each other as a team - everyone had a kind of a bond and made sure each other had time when needed etc.....
1,2104,336,2086,I was lucky as my partner was at home at the time but had he not been it would have been impossible to work the hours and look after the kids
1,2105,338,1938,Security.  Searching, name checks, etc.  Difficult with a berieved family.
1,2106,309,1938,although majority of FLO&#039;s at centre were well motivated and professional, there is always the odd one or two who let the side down, ie. by shirking their responsibilites and leaving others to do the bulk of the work.
1,2107,317,2081,It was nice to see Rons friendly face and you could go to him for help and advice - felt confindent he was there.
1,2108,321,1938,Not being able to tell my family when I would be home, not knowing what I was exactly going to be doing. Them worrying about my welfare.
1,2109,316,2071,Friends &amp; families were told to attend the Centre for information but we had none to give.
1,2110,338,1938,QE Queen Mother Sports Centre.  Bad location, unsuitable, no Air Conditioning. No comms, fax telephones etc.
1,2111,335,2092,The fear and tension on the tube after a very long day at work.
1,2112,311,1938,trying to act as a professional towads the families wihout having ang information to give them. Being left alone with a family of 5 whose mother was obviously dead. A backlash from this family of anger and not understanding that  we had no iformation.
1,2113,332,2106,or wearing very inappropriate clothing
1,2114,312,1938,Supervising colleagues the same rank as me and thinking on my feet in a FLC role without the comfort of having had the correct training for that specific role.
1,2115,319,2074,One thing Commander Allen did do was set up an account for lunch at a local cafe, which was extremely well received. I did personally thank him for it, it was appreicated.
1,2116,338,1938,Were told to not read newspapers in view of the public but that was our only source of information at the start.
1,2117,316,2077,We had no info to give and when we were given it, it was wrong. At one time, we were telling people something completely different to the FLO&#039;s in the booth next door.
1,2118,304,2077,SO 13 - using terrorism- as a neans to providing no information
1,2119,335,1938,drinking after work in order to relax and be able to sleep.
1,2120,338,1938,Not a lot of understanding from the boroughs..  When are you coming back? What are you doing.  I&#039;ve heard there is not going on?  comments like this are not helpful when you are working hard and long hours.
1,2121,331,1938,Having to be searched time and time again by the uniform officers even though they knew us had searched us previously and NO ONE appeared to be able to resolve this
1,2122,322,2105,I found that the uniform security presence at the second FAC was intimidating in the early weeks. The officers were not briefed (I believe) about what was going on inside and I did not find some of them to be particularly welcoming to the public who approached the doors, so focussed were they on searching and security.them
1,2123,332,1938,communications - no other FLO dept appeard to know what FAC was for
1,2124,334,2103,some took more time than others!!
1,2125,319,2106,Saying that, I think by the time we got to the centre at Vincent Sq everyone did pull their weight.
1,2126,338,2074,Bloody child care issues!  I don&#039;t have kids but I do have a family and a life and short notice affects me too!
1,2127,321,2024,That we exist, that we have a lot to contribute and we need to therefore be kept in the loop as to what is going on. That we are valuable in taking the investigation forward. SO13 should make the effort to speak to FLO&#039;s and explain why they can&#039;t tell FLO&#039;s or familys some of the information. We will always be required in an investigation, so let&#039;s not be an afterthought, let&#039;s have a plan.
1,2128,312,1938,General poor communcation within the organisation, too many agenda&#039;s going on above our heads that were parallel to the core role of the FAC
1,2129,309,1938,some of these problems were resolved by the appointment of Supt. Annette Weightman
1,2130,317,2105,Searching - why just because we were in plain clothes did our uniform collegues find it so apporpraite to keep on searching us!! again this made us feel 2nd class
1,2131,334,2126,nobody was discounting you they were asking about the effects generally on home life
1,2132,311,2077,Think a liason officer with some authority should be attached from SO13 to pass on the most up to date information. Also representatives from all the relevant parties ie TFL Media Press Liason.
1,2133,331,2115,This is a point that is VERY underrated. The cafe account was necessary and a great help in the early days
1,2134,332,2125,absolutely
1,2135,319,2126,Well no one said it didn&#039;t. The question was asked and we replied!
1,2136,326,2133,yum yum, breakfast lunch and dinns!
1,2137,309,2134,really??
1,2138,331,2132,I think this is a fabulous idea
1,2139,322,2130,I left the building at the end of one day to find, 15 seconds later that I had forgotten something. The officer searched me again on the way back in!
1,2140,339,2077,Families knew their loved ones were dead,we knew there was a good chance they were dead but we couldn&#039;t confirm their fears,they were left not knowing for another few days which made them very angry  they wanted confirmation which we couldn&#039;t give them.
1,2141,328,2079,Some people got above their stations !!! All trying to impress.
1,2142,326,2139,did they think it was necessary that the water bottles were put through there scanner!
1,2143,334,2135,wel ose the tone!!!
1,2144,314,2024,At least to have a plan. This plan may not survive contact but something to fall back on.
1,2145,336,2127,SO13 should be aware of our role and the fact that often we were the first point of contact for potential witnesses and well as dealing with victims and families
1,2146,338,1938,Resistance from the FLC&#039;s and FLO&#039;s with regard to the families.  Who gets a FLO and who doesn&#039;t.  If you don&#039;t fall within the usual &#039;family definition&#039; you don&#039;t qualify.  Totally against the FLO training.  A FLO told me &#039;Should I be the FLO for every shag she has had for the past 5 years!&#039;  This young lady had just lost her life and the FLO was moralising about her life.  As for the people the victim left behind, total disregard. Disgraceful.
1,2147,314,2024,A better understanding by other agencies of the working of FLO&#039;s.
1,2148,313,2024,More understanding of ACPO - level of training around the various other Police services- MPS is one cog in abig wheel.<br />Big is not always best
1,2149,332,2024,flo are part of the investigation team.  so we need to know what is going on. we must be part of a broad information sharing and de-brief for our views to be heard too
1,2150,319,2024,I think I thing I leant was to be totally flexible. We never knew from the offset what to expect. i knew it would be emotionally charged, but beyond that, I had no idea.
1,2151,336,2024,Now we know we can do it we should build on our experiences and should there be another major incidents an FAC should be set up as a metter of routine asap
1,2152,314,2024,Do not call FLo&#039;s at Hospitals that name it leads to confuse families as they think having met an FLo they are already deployed them.
1,2153,322,2127,Just because we are capable of getting by without proper preperation doesn&#039;t mean that we should always have to.
1,2154,326,2056,That we are an important role!
1,2155,331,2024,We should be treated as one of the key parts of any investigation. The fact that we are aware of intrinsic details does not mean we have to reveal them. Think trial I was told on my course. In due time it will be revealed that some of the infomation the &#039;MPS&#039; knew but did not want to release. How will the families feel then ????
1,2156,311,2107,Ron remembered me and called me by my first name!
1,2157,317,2024,make more people aware of the role of FLO, already collegues back on division think I&#039;m at some PINK and FLUFFY day - today and thats all we did at the centre it really does pi** me off
1,2158,312,2024,To remain focused on what our role is and not to get upset, confused or influenced by other peoples negativity and lack of knowledge and understanding.
1,2159,339,2024,With the bombings in NY and London,surely we must be better organised and have plans ???
1,2160,338,2024,I learnt so much it is difficult to put down in writing.  Seeing people at such a terrible time in their lives and being able to help.  What a privilege for me. Let the MPS move forward with this and use the experience that we have all gained.  Don&#039;t just deploy new people should this happen again.  What about a permanent team of dedicted FLO&#039;s for Major Incidents not just murder.
1,2161,316,2024,That we have to be flexible. The FLO course I attended was all about working with 1 family at a time but we all worked with many.
1,2162,326,2157,do you want a cuppa?!
1,2163,338,2024,Be Prepared!  Not &#039;if&#039; this will happen again but &#039;when&#039;.
1,2164,335,2024,Be prepared, draw a plan,think and learn from the previous. It might be different but sketch it out NOW we will draw the picture then.
1,2165,319,2157,i agree. There wasn&#039;t one thing that was pink and fluffy! Dealing with people whose chidren have been blown apart, really easy! NOT
1,2166,332,2160,also utilise those already trained and not just use those who have experience of a major incident.  a colleague had 2 families assigned to her, both draining and only because she has had previous experience.  how will we learn if not from doing this job too.
1,2167,336,2141,The next rank was inthe sight of many senior officers
2,2168,0,0,Bread crumbs in the forest
1,2169,338,2024,Continuing training of FLO&#039;s centrally not left to the FLC&#039;S on borough.
1,2170,321,2024,1/ Let people(other police depts, other agencies and the public), know why we are there and what we are there for.<br />2/ The importance of briefings with the other depts and agencies.<br />3/ Sharing information.<br />4/ Media strategy for a future assistance centre.<br />5/ Not having to rely on council&#039;s to implement the centre. Have them in place as dedicated sights around the Met and the country.<br />6/ A strategy for resources.<br />7/ debrief with other agencies as well. What did they think of us? What did they expect from us?<br />8/ Let the police on the street know that we exist and what we are there for.
1,2171,334,2168,Be flexible and be prepared to listen.
1,2172,332,2168,be flexible, expect nothing and be totally and utterly professional
1,2173,319,2168,Be ready to deal with any thing. With people and their raw emotions. Be prepared for their to be a lot of the organistation &quot;glory hunting&quot; out of the centre.
1,2174,335,2168,Tip
1,2175,336,2168,expect the unexpected
1,2176,317,2168,Be felxiable, be ready to learn, be ready to get pi** off with the management above but most of all be commited and professional
1,2177,338,2168,Like all Police work this is not about being told to do this and that.  You have to use your initiative and get on with it.  Do your best and if you have been chosen correctly for the role of FLO you will get to the goal.
1,2178,314,2168,Be prepared for how emotionally and physically draining this work can be.
1,2179,332,2168,ask and you shall receive - eventually
1,2180,326,2168,A police memo pad saying&quot;Expect anything and everything, each situation/family is different. Use the other agencies and remember your only human too!
1,2181,309,2168,A very detailed pack - never assuming that the next person will understand brief instructions.
1,2182,322,2170,Information about what services the other agencies can offer (and where they were in the first FAC). We had to find out for ourselves.
1,2183,332,2168,dont expect too much of yourself
1,2184,335,2174,this is how we did it, put yourself in how shoes how would you have done it.
1,2185,317,2168,Remember you are human
1,2186,331,2168,Be aware you will be dealing with some very distressed people.........Don&#039;t necessarily feel the need to fil in the gaps, use the remote control. Don&#039;t worry about money The FAC is about treating people according to thier needs. If we need something done for a family......lets get it done.......regardless of what we need to do to make it happen. I tihnk &#039;that will be on Commander Allens authority usually works&#039; !!!!
1,2187,326,2174,how much?!
1,2188,319,2168,Be ready to have no information, and try and maintain professional about it.<br />Be prepared to meet lots of famous faces, Tessa JOWELL, David BLUNKETT, Ian BLAIR etc.
1,2189,313,2168,For each unit working (e.g.FAC - CCB-etc)to have a full understanding of each others role - within mass disaster/terrorism
1,2190,312,2168,Flexible, Practical, Competant, Dynamic stick to basic FLO principles and have a sense of humour!
1,2191,338,2168,God it has been hard.  I could have cried with some of our families, but remember that the colleagues around you are p*ss taking but will support you to the hilt.  The best people I have ever worked with.
1,2192,334,2168,Listen
1,2193,328,2168,Be ready to deal with the varied emotions of people. Anger etc etc .Don&#039;t be put off. They don&#039;t mean it. It is grief.
1,2194,338,2168,Don&#039;t take it home with you.  Leave it at the door and pick it up the next day.
1,2195,331,2188,Be prepared to meet Tessa Jowell ALOT !!!!
1,2196,336,2194,Good idea
1,2197,309,2168,never lose your sense of humour.
1,2198,339,2168,keep an open mind,be flexible,professional and dont take any crticism/negative comments too personally
1,2199,332,2168,the great thing about the MPS is the humour - let us hope that whatever situation we have to deal with we continue to be able to have a laugh and joke with our colleagues, friends and family (and it not taken the wrong way!)
1,2200,335,2187,overtime
1,2201,334,2195,and get on the tele and do as many interviews as you can
1,2202,338,2168,Not everyone wants a sandwich and a cup of tea!
1,2203,316,2168,You are only human. Be prepared to feel emotional sometimes and that exhaustion, both mentally &amp; physically, will eventually set in.
1,2204,319,2191,I really did enjoy it. As mentioned I too met some really &quot;top&quot; officers who made the centre work. It was down to the leadership of Joe LENNON and us that made it work. And my god, we made the centre work!
1,2205,331,2168,Don&#039;t forget to laugh..........and learn how to do Sudoko........I am now an expert !
1,2206,317,2194,keep smiling and wear trainers
1,2207,313,2024,understanding that even with set in stone plans and training - no two jobs are the same............flexibility
1,2208,335,2175,come on it is expected isn&#039;t it?
1,2209,314,2168,Fully support your FLO&#039;s in any way you can.Management need them they dont need management.
1,2210,312,2168,Be proud and enjoy the challenge and don&#039;t make a families day worse than it already is
1,2211,326,2205,No your not I am!
1,2212,335,2185,Am i ?
1,2213,321,2168,1/ Suitable location for a briefing<br />2/ someone posted to meet and greet at the initial briefing.<br />3/ Contact details of persons involved.<br />4/ Explanation of a/ Aims<br />b/ Objectives<br />c/ Queries-who do we contact.<br />d/ What is expected of us.<br />5/ Recognition by SMT and investigating teams of FLO&#039;s<br />6/ We need hot food as well as sandwiches, crisps.<br />7/ Speak to FLO&#039;s possibly before changing areas that we are going to work in.<br />8/ Be suitably dressed- smart plainclothes(Not too casual-t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms!!!
1,2214,311,2168,Bring some toiletries with you. Dont tell your other half when you may be home.<br />Approach it with an open mind and be prepared to adapt your role to whatever is required on that day, I even found that my skill as an advanced driver was useful as one was needed to return a families car home. Be prepared to act as an appointed FLO on that day if a family from your borough is appointed one.
1,2215,319,2206,Trainers did help greatly
1,2216,338,2195,And members of the Royal Family in big hats and very large diamonds, practice your curtseys.
1,2217,309,2205,r u onto fiendish yet??
1,2218,331,2205,Yep I can even do Samarai

1,2446,1160,2376,Who&#039;s going to pay for it?
1,2447,1172,2422,the MPS needs to stay loyal to this ethos
1,2448,1111,2427,So do I !!
1,2449,1129,2421,bad timing
1,2450,1158,2366,improved training for initial responders
1,2451,1097,2385,you must have been in a different meeting
1,2452,1126,2378,it identified national ways of aid but did it help the Met?
1,2453,1106,2378,this damaged public relations for a decade
1,2454,1157,2348,but what did it mean and what difference did it make
1,2455,1117,2320,been involved a few times - but never received feed-back on the outomes!
1,2456,1110,2356,What did/does this op do for London
1,2457,1108,2442,can we extend its use to unit level?
1,2458,1155,2338,Where is the evidence that it works
1,2459,1109,2384,Good OH programme
1,2460,1150,2356,involved working together across the world
1,2461,1140,2314,excellent example of can do mentality
1,2462,1146,2366,good<br />but has gone stale, needs refreshing
1,2463,1149,2387,not only the MPS!
1,2464,1168,2422,The public love it and the cops once engaged love ot too
1,2465,1154,2314,But we failed to learn the lessons of 9/11
1,2466,1115,2423,Developing police officers and police staff TOGETHER
1,2467,1093,2381,really made a difference
1,2468,1116,2304,and i did nt say that jc, but only example of TP and SCD and community together
1,2469,1113,2309,very impressed with how all the training and teamwork paid off when the time came
1,2470,1172,2439,best deputy comm. we don&#039;t have

1,2474,1163,2363,does this temendous work assist the majority of londoners?

1,2476,1171,2354,Was this a review of Geordies or did you mean RAF?
1,2477,1145,2442,if each has a laptop
1,2478,1104,2368,only if they&#039;re realistic
1,2479,1165,2351,A  great example of fast time creative working, which delivered an effective response utilising the great synergy of the MPS
1,2480,1143,2408,the sad thing is I am not!
1,2481,1152,2342,Probably the most creative person in the MPS
1,2482,1097,2420,So lets do a 2 or 3 year plan
1,2483,1160,2391,Completely changed expectations and set a new minimum standard
1,2484,1119,2418,Good change of direction but little cultural change  the front line
1,2485,1144,2358,diverse skills combining in crisis to imaginatively produce solutions in a challenging environment (at no notice)
1,2486,1153,2344,hardly creative
1,2487,1149,2453,more like 20 years
1,2488,1109,2388,not just criminologists but a range of people from different backgrounds &amp; with different skill sets
1,2489,1096,2366,A lot are borne out of crisis - how well do we do business as usual
1,2490,1128,2381,c3i programme
1,2491,1135,2314,chaotic an example of nim not working
1,2492,1113,2310,are we getting into mission creep?
1,2493,1164,2344,provides independant views
1,2494,1146,2412,don&#039;t diss my leader
1,2495,1119,2418,What&#039;s happened to it - Morris Inq
1,2496,1105,2349,Resource intensive and where will extra rsources come from?
1,2497,1106,2379,Valuable but elitist
1,2498,1142,2294,all members of the MPS top to bottom need to adopt a corporate approach
1,2499,1150,2294,it needs to be meaningful for our front line staff,
1,2500,1109,2294,Ensure that the troops on the ground understand how it will affect them
1,2501,1136,2294,like the strategy but it needs to be translated for our staff to help them understand how they fit and contribute to delivery
1,2502,1125,2294,make sure it is corporate, not in descrete silos.
1,2503,1110,2294,help us to translate the management speak to have resonance for all our staff
1,2504,1125,2294,make sure it doesn&#039;t mean we try to do too much to ensure we aceive nothing.
1,2505,1154,2500,and what they can do to positively impact upon it
1,2506,1148,2499,ownership at local level
1,2507,1109,2294,Corporate strategy is not just about doing what we do better, but places an emphasis on doing it more efficiently. Getting more from what we already have...
1,2508,1103,2503,you are part of the management and you need to be part of the solution not the problem. Why do you need to be told. Why don&#039;t you interpret the strategy and lead yourself
1,2509,1150,2294,corporate strategy can only be delivered if corpracy exists by breaking down the business group silos
1,2510,1169,2294,can do from all staff no room for cant cos
1,2511,1170,2503,how do you think we should do that
1,2512,1148,2500,including specialist ocus
1,2513,1096,2294,Value those of us who have strategic and change management skills
1,2514,1175,2294,make sure it really dictates what we do AND what we don&#039;t do
1,2515,1117,2294,It needs a recognisable name - not &quot;The Corp Strategy&quot;.The London Beat was a change strategy that delivered major change - we remember that. Give  the CS a similar brand.
1,2516,1148,2508,empowerment
1,2517,1103,2507,I agree. We need to be good at what we do daily and are judged by as well as the new activity
1,2518,1149,2294,plain english and less buzz words
1,2519,1118,2294,MPS &amp; MPA to abolish hierarchy of diversity to ensure that all minority groups within the police service are treated equally
1,2520,1125,2507,or doing more for the same - wider mission
1,2521,1155,2514,Do we know what that is?
1,2522,1175,2512,and support OCUs
1,2523,1170,2504,dont sell yourself short the challenge is big the prize  is greater
1,2524,1103,2511,by you taking the initiative on the overall direction of travel and not waiting to be told what or how to do it.
1,2525,1150,2294,communication is the key, there appears to be an overdrive in the information coming out
1,2526,1157,2519,what does that mean?
1,2527,1109,2294,We have to see Management Board members treating each other with respect
1,2528,1153,2294,Don&#039;t assume that one method working on one OCU will be effective on another .............single manned patrols are not always the answer to high visibility policing. Look at the longer term moral of your ground force!
1,2529,1104,2294,make corporate strategy a citical incident
1,2530,1150,2294,management as well as leadership
1,2531,1095,2294,the command culture needs to change first - we have to treat the workforce with the same respect and courtesy and professionalism we demand they afford to the public
1,2532,1170,2525,now you see the dichotomy how do you suggest it is addressed
1,2533,1155,2498,Are we suggesting that mb were not signed up to previous strategies.  How will we demonstrate that this is different?
1,2534,1168,2294,Measurements of success must reflect the long term, innovative and organisational aspirations of the MPS.  These then adding to the short term, politically driven operational metrics.
1,2535,1103,2527,we all do - not just man board
1,2536,1118,2526,This means that ethnic minority groups are given primacy, women&#039;s issues come second and other issues such as gay issues are not progressed or valued in the same way.  This is evidenced through many examples both from within the HR Directorate and by the &quot;Diversity&quot; Directorate.
1,2537,1103,2531,what do you mean
1,2538,1169,2509,i sometimes feel this silo nonsense is more myth than reality but i may be wrong.  there will always be tensions between competing priorities and there will not always be consensus. we must not overstate this as a problem more a reality of policing a great city .
1,2539,1096,2531,and each other
1,2540,1150,2294,how robust is the strategy to stand up to political influence, the drive towards citiizen focus could mean increase in confidence in reporting crime
1,2541,1161,2519,they are treated equally, but equality does not mean that everybody is treated the same. All our needs are different and that is the key to delivering  a equalitive service
1,2542,1102,2534,And success should make a real difference to the public - real change not reorganising the figures
1,2543,1109,2535,Agree, but they must set the example
1,2544,1125,2514,directs not dictates
1,2545,1169,2515,got a name?
1,2546,769,2294,Operationalise the strategy,remove the sterile corridor between it and policing reality. How many frontline oficers were involved in its creation.
1,2547,1103,2536,i disagree. To get an even playing field we need to give priority. we cannot do everything for everybody for that will never change anything
1,2548,1134,2294,we have to be willing to hear about the problems - and help people overcome what will be inevitable barriers
1,2549,1163,2500,do you think the term &#039;troops&#039; connects us with the public?
1,2550,1132,2294,We need the time it takes to develop the enabling strategies HR IS etc.
1,2551,1171,2294,If values underpin the organisation then they must be seen to be lived by us at the top.
1,2552,1109,2294,Be seen to value Staff Associations and not just show them lip service
1,2553,1169,2294,get the budget sorted out
1,2554,1103,2501,then translate it for your team
1,2555,1126,2294,strategy should not be supported by staff but driven by staff
1,2556,1096,2525,we seem to be better at talking than listening to the results of consultation
1,2557,1134,2294,support  decision making at all levels
1,2558,1114,2528,Look beyond that, important as morale is, more important is the day to day experience of the public of a service which is openly accessible to them
1,2559,1169,2294,what is the vision of outcome expectation and the route milestones
1,2560,1095,2294,we need to monitor the impact major policy implementations - signing them off does not mean they will be implemented and implementing them does not mean they will succeed
1,2561,1118,2541,Interesting point, but this is not the perception of LGBT staff within the MPS.  It is also not the view of the National GPA.  The MPS are letting LGBT staff down and prioritising issues from other minority groups.
1,2562,1171,2515,Should we not label all of this as Together?
1,2563,1125,2527,and their managers too
1,2564,1119,2546,thats what lawrence acheived
1,2565,1110,2294,Decide where we want to be in the &#039;market place&#039;. Do we want to be &#039;high end&#039; leaders? or will we be satisfied being just very good&#039;?  We want to be &#039;high end&#039; but that needs investment.  Where do we all want to position ourselves?
1,2566,1119,2540,like race hate domestic violence
1,2567,1163,2502,how do we make this actually happens?
1,2568,1103,2552,do you mean the fed or trades unions or staff support assocs. If fed or tu, there is already a lot of respectbut sometimes there needs to be a reality dosage. If the latter, there is total respect for what they stand for.
1,2569,1121,2532,Now&#039;s the time to consolodate the messages not change them.
1,2570,1108,2547,if you face discrimintion the affects are the same, the cause may be different but the suffering is mirrored
1,2571,1105,2294,we need to resource the first interaction with the public and ensure we get it right first time. telephone aswering times, queues at front counters, response times to their calls. actually deliver a better service to our communities
1,2572,1119,2540,and no crime reduction in certai nareasie increased confidence &amp; citizen focus
1,2573,1138,2531,How is a &pound;3 billion budget a financial blocker?
1,2574,1103,2553,you are abudget holder. contribute.
1,2575,1161,2553,the mpa have
1,2576,1147,2553,ensure you do not run down parts of MPS &amp; only react when it goes wrong.
1,2577,1118,2294,all strategies start with commitment and enthusiasm. This one will only be different if we keep it alive as time and pressures move us on.
1,2578,1168,2294,Real modernisation of the workforce.  Get on and build the invest to save initiatives that will acrue benefit.. Build custody hubs, build single input crime reporting centres.  We have talked about these for a generationof cops, viz 10-15 yrs.
1,2579,1165,2294,This isnt strategic, it doesnt link into other social issues such as education, housing, employment and health. Where are the links to the wider issues, thepolitical imperatives.
1,2580,1119,2571,with right people &amp; skills
1,2581,1093,2294,link it to pay
1,2582,1171,2547,Why don&#039;t we stop focusing on a person&#039;s gender/sexual orientation/religion/race and ask &#039;what can you contribute to what we&#039;re trying to achieve&#039; ?   and if the answer is  very little, they leave us.  If it&#039;s something constructive, we support and encourage them.
1,2583,1102,2294,Not just a set of new ideas - be &#039;in it&#039; for the long term and get much better at managing our day-to-day processes.  Reward success in this.
1,2584,1134,2294,we can do it by showing how these key elements overlap - again, we have this information we should use it
1,2585,1095,2531,i mean that it is unrealistic to expect our officers to exercise their authority appropriately and with fairness if they themselves are not treated in that way
1,2586,1121,2551,Not sure &#039;have pride is value. Pride comes from all the other stuff we do. It should say on the tin - Protect and serve there can be no greater priority.
1,2587,1108,2561,this has always been the echoed view of the dsa and the NDPA
1,2588,1103,2570,agreed. but there has to be a priority
1,2589,1119,2551,and driven for all staff, ie morris frozen heart
2,2590,0,0,How do we shift to a customer focus whilst improving performance
1,2591,1149,2568,so u dont respect tu&#039;s or the fed then?
1,2592,1148,2553,devolved budgets are a myth
1,2593,1157,2531,success must be measured against it-inlcuding a more robust performance management framework
1,2594,1146,2294,when do we do a dvd on the day-to-day stuff
1,2595,1150,2294,we are the most profligate of organisations. our consumption of resources is so wasteful and will only be changed when every individual takes personal responsibility for what they use and consume - even something as simple as turning off the light or not having to hard copy everything
1,2596,1119,2551,what happened to openess &amp; transparency &amp; honesty
1,2597,1109,2553,We have a vast budget, but for far too long there has been no pressure on us to use it efficiently or account properly for how we do use it
1,2598,1113,2294,simple language relevant to the lady in the canteen at esb
1,2599,1149,2568,does reality mean selling our jobs ?
1,2600,1162,2553,there is general reluctance to accept responsibility for all use of resources and waste is prevalent.  Look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves!
1,2601,1166,2294,Accountability for all managers
1,2602,1128,2294,poorat commujnication look at the recent example regarding the icg group
1,2603,1136,2508,the overall objectives are sound but we need to recognise that performance re crime reduction has a glass floor
1,2604,1117,2294,What gets measured gets done -build an open transparent performance structure of reporting and meeting that holds us to open accountability - internal and in partnerhship.<br />With a range of simple targets that everyone can understand
1,2605,1096,2294,good point!
1,2606,1111,2518,I totally agree, keep it very simple, easy to understand an on one side of A4 paper !!
1,2607,1135,2294,clear vision with simple achievable steps
1,2608,1172,2579,it is safer neighbourhoods improves lives across education health and a variety of quality of life issues
1,2609,1113,2294,top down endorsement that citizens desires/wants can challenge the usual performance culture
1,2610,1123,2294,Make sure cops and staff on the ground understand why and what is expected of them. Effective communication
1,2611,1096,2590,are these mutually exclusive?
1,2612,1142,2294,use this to inform all decision making
1,2613,1160,2590,There is no dichotomy here, customer focus and improved performance must mean the same or we are not getting it right!
1,2614,1149,2598,success will be the day that the comment is not even thought!
1,2615,1103,2558,hear hear
1,2616,1163,2553,i want real devolvement on borough
1,2617,1172,2590,get it right first time and ensure the quality to people
1,2618,1173,2294,the opportunity to think strategically is overtaken by the need to meet short term operational demands
1,2619,1113,2294,how do we pay for the next terrorist incident?
1,2620,1169,2528,professionalising patrol is more than single crewing it is about our street professional face visble approachable and familiar. two officers chatting to each other does not make them approachable
1,2621,1171,2578,This is exactly what the Service Review has tried to deliver
1,2622,1159,2294,Understand why we are an &quot;Adrenalin junkie organisation&quot;.  Use that understanding to drive strategy.
1,2623,1104,2294,stop trying to do everything. Lets concentrate on some key issues that will really make a difference. If we achieve them maintain the position and then pick off a few more.
1,2624,1143,2590,this is about culture rather than strategy    -  do front line staff see citizens as customers or somebody they impose their will on
1,2625,1127,2519,must mean something to everyone - must be understandable - must have emotional buy in
1,2626,1161,2528,i think there may be some confusion - what is proximity patrol? is it single manning?  not a police officer but this seems to be causing more concern than any other element
1,2627,1140,2294,Where does demand management and fast time operational delivery sit
1,2628,1134,2294,staff know what good/bad  serviceis. We need to take personal responsibility for selfquality control and make timeto get it right
1,2629,1128,2527,towerhamlets is a rolls royce model can we deliver to the rest of the mps
1,2630,1135,2294,performance regime more sopisticated
1,2631,1156,2552,Management Board need to show throughout the year that the boring stuff is as important as the latest political crisis.  If that happens we will all start to believe it really is important.
1,2632,1121,2518,it must be relevant. it must be achievable. people must know what is required of them. it must be driven and those required to deliver it be held accountable.
1,2633,1163,2594,we did on the London Beat
1,2634,1103,2585,Step into the real world and you may have a fifferent perspective
1,2635,1092,2294,Make the strategy and plans living documents through the use of a business risk process to focus on the big issues and hold people accountable
1,2636,1119,2551,It is a gross generalisation to say that we don&#039;t succeed at trivial, day to day matters, this denigrates the hard work undertaken by so many that is unrecognised, of course we could always do better
1,2637,1150,2294,a critical success factor will be how our partners are influenced by our strategy eg we are committed to a roll out across London, but how are the local authority signed up ?
1,2638,1096,2598,I hope we&#039;re not going to patronise our staff!
1,2639,1137,2518,Make the language simple
1,2640,1131,2503,We are back to the late turn van driver. If it means nothing to them it means nothing at all.
1,2641,1117,2294,Need to move away from a hierarchical, ranked-based organisation. We&#039;re all adults and should be treated as such. Use of first names is a start!
1,2642,1148,2294,we are not adrenalin junkies
1,2643,1142,2294,strategy requires strength of purpose and bravery to resist the magic of the moment. we are not good at that.
1,2644,1113,2294,How will training support the strategy........no  focus on customer relations
1,2645,1159,2294,Strong delivery plan which measures success - cross cutting
1,2646,1164,2294,many staff will say they have heard this all before with each change of Commissioner - nothing has happened and no one consulted them. We have to convince them it is different this time and that at some point there will be a period of stability
1,2647,1140,2294,don&#039;t rubbish operational delivery or past work
1,2648,1094,2294,accountability for delivery needs to be clear - at the moment a lot of talemt is wasted
1,2649,1115,2594,If today is trying to focus on the day to day policing agenda - having a DVD on the July bombings is sending out a mixed message.
1,2650,1166,2294,The primary focus for all staff should be delivering what is right for the public (primary customer), then the MPS and finally the individual.
1,2651,1161,2528,this is typical of us thinking about what suits us and expecting the public to work around it
1,2652,1126,2294,past srategies have delivered but only inpart - this strategy will deliver but only in part - what is the most important part - we will deliver it
1,2653,1155,2590,The public must be able to see the police doing their job all of the time and see that they interact positively with the public. Zero tolerance.
1,2654,1106,2294,We must break down silo working by making SCD, TP and CO etc interdependent
1,2655,1157,2534,we need the politicians (particularly central government) to let us get on with it and understand that in setting their targets they are often setting us up in the middle of what londoners want as against what the treasury thinks is the most efficient way of doing things
1,2656,1111,2590,Do we really know what the customer wants .. they will be different in different parts of London, and on different Boroughs, and even in different wards ?
1,2657,1141,2294,Perhaps we should invite the trade unions to this conference in future if wehave n&#039;t done so for today.
1,2658,1136,2508,It is a leaders role to create an understanding - not just the top team but across the org
1,2659,1143,2590,how can we expect to treat out customers well when we dont treat our staff well
1,2660,1127,2519,Can we stop calling it a corportae strategy the title is a turn off -management  gobbledegook -does not engage the average member of the MPS
1,2661,1113,2294,this is about what we do. Let people own what we do and they will deliver what we want to do
1,2662,1128,2527,andrenalin junkies let the bocu cmdrs get on with the daily life instead of slaves to acpo causes serving the centre and not the community
1,2663,1157,2655,how do we do that then
1,2664,1168,2590,By having a clearer ubderstanding about what the &#039;customer&#039; wants and not just presuming
1,2665,1103,2616,what do you want to decide that you don&#039;t already
1,2666,1121,2500,The last one fell when the priority over everything else became robbery - at least for boroughs
1,2667,1188,2294,we must ensure that all elements are properly funded. That includes Information Quality
1,2668,1150,2294,if you want to change the organisation you must first change yourselves.
1,2669,1135,2294,reward should be linked to corp strat not perfomance only
1,2670,1152,2579,true - so where does the mayor&#039;soffice sit with this? they have a large influence on this
1,2671,1132,2590,We need some &#039;mystery shopper&#039; experiences played back to Mnaagement Board. &#039;Satisfaction&#039; surveys tell us little
1,2672,1148,2515,if you want it to succeed don&#039;t call it a corporate strategy
1,2673,1138,2294,With the Govt looking at restructuring forces should we be looking at the MPS as a whole.  Shift the power to BCUs and LSP
1,2674,1142,2643,there must be a realistic long term view rather than long term quick fixes
1,2675,1093,2294,make it shorter and easier to read
1,2676,1161,2540,we need people to report crime so we can deal with it, reduce it and make them safer.  would we rather live in cloud cuckoo land?
1,2677,1116,2594,we did it was called murder blues, how many of the top team viewed it ? not many I&#039;m told, if they did they might learn about the needs of the service and communities
1,2678,1155,2590,Are we clear who our customers are?
1,2679,1149,2657,you have i am here
1,2680,1124,2550,busniess group strategies are often not releted and do not link with local plans- often glossies
1,2681,1172,2622,we dont reward or recognise people for doing the everyday job only those engaged in &#039;crisis&#039; work
1,2682,1096,2294,Planning is the key to success
1,2683,1136,2294,Major org change is difficult &amp; we should we not have unrealistic expectations of immediate success - embedding may take 3 - 4 yrs
1,2684,1106,2294,We do not train staff how to interelate with the public.  Have we ever trained people to how to give feedback on incidents reports etc
1,2685,1119,2551,challenge - ditch the egos and be together to try and deal with the issues/problems, by the best placed unit/team and not who is going t pay for it
1,2686,1151,2571,Isn&#039;t this exactly what we say we&#039;re about to do with c3i, SR etc
1,2687,1115,2529,Brilliant idea - identify the critical success factors and map them onto corporte strategy implementation.
1,2688,1170,2640,does it need to be understood by them?
1,2689,1159,2294,Clear communication at all levels is the key.  Staff need to understand what it means for them.  The change programme must be integrated cross-functionally and clearly set out.
1,2690,1104,2294,the seven priorities in the Corporate Strategy and the themes from the Service Review need to be scoped and implemented coherently.  Otherwise its a top level fight for resources which is unhealthy for the organisation.
1,2691,1141,2519,to much political correctness
1,2692,1095,2294,we need to build on success - if a branch of a large company delivers particular success it is examined and copied to the rest of the organization as apropriate
1,2693,1152,2581,Need to have rewards, sanctions and PI&#039;s to make the strategy a reality
1,2694,1103,2647,not sure anyone has
1,2695,1111,2590,Ensure the CDRP&#039;s are signed up as well as the MPS
1,2696,1129,2590,take it off paper make people talk about it
1,2697,1157,2663,concerntrate on what the stragey tells us to do and don&#039;t get into a panic when things dont go right at first
1,2698,1150,2294,the strategy needs to empower senior staff this will engender creatvity and service to the locality
1,2699,1103,2657,they are here
1,2700,1149,2673,Yes but are we prepared for the accountability to local partnerships that this would involve?
1,2701,1119,2681,true
1,2702,1163,2294,will the organisation ever think about a strategy - the challenge is to communicate this - all the slides so far are too busy still
1,2703,1135,2294,early definition of sucsess
1,2704,1131,2688,yes!
1,2705,1110,2659,This might be tough love - our staff have many benefits
1,2706,1145,2577,we need to recognise and reward (not necessarily cash) good individual perfromance that supports the corporate strategy vision. This success needs to  be highly visible.
1,2707,1173,2498,careful handling here - not everyone is going to stay with the mps
1,2708,1156,2294,Greater flexibility in mamaging resources and measuring success-% change in annual crime figures  is  a poor indicator of what is being delivered or the qualty of service-longer term approach needed to encourage committment and consistency
1,2709,1109,2579,If we are going to get upstream of the the families and communities most at risk of offending, these are also the same people who are also the most at risk of drug and alcohol abuse, poor education, poor health etc - we do need short, medium and long term strategies that join up accross agencies
1,2710,1137,2518,Prioritisation needs to be given to elements of the corporate strategy because that is the steer the orgainsation is looking for from Management Board
1,2711,1166,2294,Realistic expectancy re long term continued performance improvement across all areas
1,2712,1152,2693,Good idea
1,2713,1126,2294,The dissemination of messages seem to fall down as they go across the Service. There needs to be face to face briefings from the central offices to the local boroughs. This is the ONLY way to make officers and local police staff feel &#039;safe&#039; and support the change.
1,2714,1188,2590,We need to reposition the police officer as a genuine community based problem solver and facilitator.  This may mean that the SN role should actually be expressed as a commitment to put in place properly trained and supported teams - not simply the resence of the teams.
1,2715,1106,2622,Because its fun and exciting. We need to create a new focus for colleagues as to what is important
1,2716,1168,2590,Replace 80% I call standard with more meaningful charter measures around front counter services, problem identification to problem rectification as examples.  BUT make thes have an importance..
1,2717,1113,2527,we have had several years of dismissing corporate strategy type activity from the very top - will have to work doubly hard now, esp mb
1,2718,1161,2636,the point is that we are the lowest in the country re satisfaction and confidence.  we may think we are good but the public don&#039;t think so to the same degree.  we are like the old fashioned medical consultant who knows best for the patient, without listening to her or him
1,2719,1151,2642,I dislike the use of &#039;adrenalin junkies&#039; in a pejorative way which demeans operationally competent members of the MPS.
1,2720,1171,2644,You do reap what you sow  -  if we recruit &#039;adrenelin junkies&#039;, then that&#039;s what we&#039;re have for the next 30 years......where&#039;s the emphasis on qyaiilty service the public ????
1,2721,1141,2610,have the trades unions been invited? if not why not?  Are they being excluded
1,2722,1110,2590,This is about entering into realistic contracts. Identical rights but different needs
1,2723,1117,2294,open plan offices are a start-all SMT in one place to help with communication with private space for confidential matters. start having joint working space with our partners. What about SMT with the Chief Exec and their board working closer together
1,2724,1096,2528,We need to focus on the outcomes, e.g. rolling out safer n&#039;hoods is not the endin itself; SNT&#039;s must also work to deliver citizen focus and accessibility
1,2725,1148,2531,democracy didn&#039;t deliver on 7/7
1,2726,1125,2705,like having to wait for their pay rise every year
1,2727,1153,2294,need CS to underpin decision making. Used as a reference in decision-making fora such as Investment Board
1,2728,1154,2659,speak for yourself
1,2729,1121,2590,This is not about cuts but redirecting resources to front line polcing - need to clarify this. Budget issues are making it look otherwise
1,2730,1153,2294,Where is the CS in the appraisal process???
1,2731,1119,2695,very true in partnership with the SNTs
1,2732,1123,2705,But it&#039;s not just about benefits, look at the accommodation, the lack of decent residential training, lask of suitable lockers accommodation, right offices in the right areas
1,2733,1172,2295,take personal responsibility for delivery of SN Teams
1,2734,1110,2726,There was a pay rise.  Not every private business was able to give one.
1,2735,1137,2590,Customer focus is not a priority for response policing
1,2736,1153,2294,Need to ensure junior managers &amp; first line supervisors are on board with the message
1,2737,1093,2303,management board to improve its visibility<br />better engagement with staff<br />think the unthinkable but ask the blindingly obvious as well<br />dont shoot the messenger
1,2738,1147,2590,A 12 month moratorium on MPS staff leaving London to deliver presentations on what a good job they are doing. Concentrate on the day job which is not boring but the real thing,
1,2739,1172,2303,team work !!!
1,2740,1121,2617,How do we ensure staff get it right first time. Are we investing sufficiently in appropriate training and development across a range of roles.
1,2741,1149,2295,by ensuring no police staff jobs are outsourced nor are there any redundacies
1,2742,1141,2578,how is this to be funded its called start up costs and currently that outstrips any savings we might make
1,2743,1136,2613,agree but our current performance is measured in ways the public do NOT
1,2744,1119,2695,there must be joined up strategy at government level for public services with complimentary objectivesi
1,2745,1103,2688,of course. it is the tea lady bit in nasa. their job is as central as yours.
1,2746,1109,2303,To be mature and act like they are running a &pound;3 billion organisation. To have no organisational decisions based on personal agendas, which unfortunately appears to occur rather frequently at present
1,2747,1132,2303,to remove blockers to change
1,2748,1148,2729,You can spin it how you want but come and tell that to staff on specialist OCUs facing 4% cuts meaning 20 plus officers being shed.
1,2749,1096,2295,encourage colleagues to learn from others&#039; good practice and use project mgt skills
1,2750,1112,2741,How do you know that this is not needed?
1,2751,1173,2303,clarity
1,2752,1153,2294,Proactively dismantle continuing divides between police officers &amp; staff eg on DLA intranet only DACs pen pictures given but not police staff direct line reports to Mngt Bd members - are their roles not as important?
1,2753,1134,2303,a centre of excellence that is a service to the whole corporation
1,2754,1108,2746,Can you give some examples?
1,2755,1132,2303,low operating costs high impact
1,2756,1172,2303,ongoing support throughout the full year - commitment for the long term
1,2757,1112,2746,How will you know that they have changed?
1,2758,1141,2581,obviously never been involved in pay talks with government
1,2759,1136,2303,look at reward and recognition of senior people promotion is not the answer nor is an annual increment when there are now very few
1,2760,1109,2741,In an organisation of this size we must be able to make people redundant - it is absurd to think this will never be necessary
1,2761,1162,2624,is it important to ensure that the people we recruit want to live the MPS values and not what they individually perceive being an MPS member means?  If so how?
1,2762,1134,2753,this means expertise is recognised, advertised and respected
1,2763,1120,2294,Top team needs to say &#039;no&#039; on occasion to extenal demands...........
1,2764,1175,2295,commit to leading and learning in equal parts
1,2765,1171,2741,How do you know there aren&#039;t people who would welcome this and for whom this would be the right way forward?
1,2766,1170,2295,visibility and clear communication - talking and listening
1,2767,1096,2741,Is this realistic or in the best interests of service delivery?
1,2768,1172,2295,ensure effective communication to staff and partners
1,2769,1161,2747,to sack or re-prgramme those who are not willing to change
1,2770,1132,2303,capability to respond quickly to emerging risks do it to the MPS before somebody does it for us
1,2771,1108,2747,Lets debate the blockers so we all focus on changing these concerns
1,2772,1149,2303,to stop acting as recruitment agents for the FED and to respect the trade union rights of all police staff
1,2773,1171,2749,And Change Management Skills
1,2774,1134,2753,this means that expertise is not only a uniform, but recognised professional expertise and infromed by uniform needs
1,2775,1121,2729,That&#039;s the point - was it Service Review or wasit a budget cut. Where does one start and the other end
1,2776,1108,2747,one persons blocker is another persons champion!
1,2777,1141,2581,realignment is a euphemism for cuts
1,2778,1119,2729,this in not only about SC, TP has realignment as well, with equal impact on individuals, is this about silos again as opposed to who is best place to deliver a qualitative service
1,2779,1142,2303,consistant messages that give detail and do not confuse issues  i.e Service review realingement Vs MTFP savings
1,2780,1155,2770,Be aware of the risks and influence them
1,2781,1168,2295,I have and will continue to develop a frame work that will and does drive organisational aspirations..  That, for ease of understanding, mirrors that which drives operational objectives.  Viz an organisational control strategy that mirrors NIM structures and give it the same importance and focus.  Yearly policing plaans are turgid and lack direction and impetus, three monthly organisational planned activity is agile and drivable.
1,2782,1096,2741,If we need to do this we must ensure we have fair processes, not personal agendas and informal appraisals
1,2783,1113,2748,you keep saying no cuts, only realignment. Iam looking at cuts to my front line units
1,2784,1171,2766,and hearing others views, concerns and pains from change.
1,2785,1133,2750,will you look at jobs that were outsourced but which have saved no money and weakened the MPS?
1,2786,1150,2741,This is so old fashioned and why the strategy would not work. What arogance to believe those in post are best fitted for the future. Sure there is much good but also much staleness and old thinking
1,2787,1162,2741,surely the aim must be best value not a job preservation scheme
1,2788,1151,2654,They are - that is one of the big lessons and successes from July
1,2789,1118,2303,Not to task a new senior member of staff whenever a new issue or problem surfaces without first asking whether it is already someone&#039;s job, and maybe they just need some additional support or impetus to deliver successfully
1,2790,1148,2303,if your going to cut us, are you going to promise no increase in workload?
1,2791,1132,2771,individual agendas and self preservation prevent successful change
1,2792,1095,2738,why just 12 months? why not reevaluate long term the balance between core service delivery and extra-curricular activity
1,2793,1149,2590,gettting more police officers out of offices and replacing them with properly trained police staff
1,2794,1128,2295,contribute to the debate in hr around service centres if we get this wrong it will be a huge white and expensive elephant as the police officer will do what they always do and replace with an alternative ie chief inspector personnel and we will go backwards.deprofessionalise and take away experence from the front line
1,2795,1093,2590,Our start must be to know what our job is - politicians havr to guide us we cannot do evrything
1,2796,1106,2303,The devil is in the detail.  While I am content to deliver my version of the coroporate strategy I need some well articulated guidance so I deliever mesages in a common style that fits with what is expected.  The delivery of &#039;messages&#039; needs to be carefully thought out and timing is crucially important.   The quality and in particular clarity of information given to middle managers is crucially important. Get it right first time and we delver what you want.
1,2797,1170,2784,and giving honest answers
1,2798,1141,2581,why is the MPS passing responsibility for crime reduction to our partners?
1,2799,1106,2303,trust me to do my job
1,2800,1148,2303,To ensure continuity and consistency of leadership esp. in ACPO leads.
1,2801,1138,2303,How does it become stronger - you have used the word 3 times but have not explained how?
1,2802,1103,2741,every business moves on. if they don&#039;t they go bust. if we are not to become stale we need to find new and cheaper ways of working. to do that there will regrettably be casualties. but if we don&#039;t we will become less effective and more remote
1,2803,1172,2772,move on and become a part of the team, stop sticking to personal agendas
1,2804,1132,2776,so long as they work in the interest of the community and MPS  and not self
1,2805,1155,2303,Do we understand what needs to be at &#039;the Centre&#039;?
1,2806,1103,2760,hear hear
1,2807,1119,2729,whathappens in this realignment to the older staff, who do not see a job for them it is demotivating for those who still want to work and deliver
1,2808,1104,2295,educate staff that it is not all about them. It&#039;s about what we do for others
1,2809,1161,2735,because the messages we send our response team colleagues are all about getting there quickly, not providing quality when they get there.  we need to show we value the latter over the former
1,2810,1151,2692,Hear Hear - but are we bold enough to identify where and how real success is found - might be uncomfortable for some.
1,2811,1141,2621,I hope the next phase is better than the first part.
1,2812,1103,2786,we already have too much dead wood. we have such a low turnover. we need an injection of adrenaline
1,2813,1120,2790,Stop escalating upwards accountability levels, which disempowers colleagues and diverts us from proper role
1,2814,1150,2741,the language used must be inclusive we will deliver, not you will deliver
1,2815,1149,2732,like having headquarters buildings in central london and not west nor kent!
1,2816,1161,2738,especially nypd!
1,2817,1123,2793,Absolutely - but across the board, what&#039;s good or one is good for all
1,2818,1128,2741,no redundancies is a big promise in the context of creating service centres can you make that promise to the hr community?
1,2819,1096,2803,here here
1,2820,1162,2294,the values statement is good but rather long and not in plain enough English therefore it is not memorable or easy to communicate right across the 45k staff base.
1,2821,1166,2590,Qualitative PIs and links to reward.<br />Come out of PNB
1,2822,1169,2714,this is why they are ring fenced for that very reason but already many want to reduce that protection all of us must defend their role which will be challenged in the immediate future
1,2823,1123,2795,We do know what our job is
1,2824,1172,2303,i expect the centre to really focus on neighbourhoods, not boroughs as suggetsted by AC Brown, all public services are moving towards local delivery
1,2825,1106,2303,ervice centres are a good opportuntity but also a threat to efficiency if we get it wrong.  The focus must be to improve efficiency rather than save money.  Hopefully we can improve efficiency and save money providing this work is not rushed through
1,2826,1126,2786,i completely agree. this is a business and &#039;jobs for life&#039; help neither the business or the delivery. it produces complacency.
1,2827,1114,2748,but that is what you have to do: people are being moved in order to create the SN teams that the citizens want and that is the corporate decision which this room must support
1,2828,1168,2729,We must be honest and tell our staff exactly how it is, rather than hiding behind weaks words.  Be brave !!!
1,2829,1163,2303,it makes decisions in the knwlege of the full implications and within the framework of the strategy
1,2830,1153,2303,It is invidious to say there are no cuts only redirection when the resource being redirected is currently in police staff functions which will have to reduce to pay for other functions such as PCSOs. For the people involved they do face the prospect of being cut - don&#039;t dress up the reality
1,2831,1141,2653,much more of this
1,2832,1103,2799,know what you mean. less monitors would save a fortune
1,2833,1119,2714,those teams are critical to delivery, need to be recgnised in all boroughs as part of the crime fighting team
1,2834,1137,2792,Does this mean we should be priortising our activity?  Should not the Corporate Strategy and Management Board provide the steer as to what is important and what is not?
1,2835,769,2748,Perhaps in the short term we can&#039;t do both.  I do believe that providing a better service to the public would make people feel safer - irrespective of crime levels
1,2836,1171,2801,The role of the centre is reduced but the areas that it keeps it will have a real role to control systems such as intelligence and to ensure compliance with corporate approaches
1,2837,1126,2303,trust managers on OCUs to deliver. This implies a degree of risk but it is the only way to deliver
1,2838,1161,2716,absolutely right.  we need to start putting the measures of the things the public think are important about quality of service, right up front.  they need to become the primary measures, the must do, not at the back of the performance pack as the nice to do
1,2839,1149,2760,have you not heard of re-training?
1,2840,1108,2590,has the idea of custody clusters consider the rights of the disabled appropriate adult or legal representative
1,2841,1096,2737,get out of offices - walk around - and encourage private offices to be lean and customer focused
1,2842,1098,2590,we have to take a problem solving approach to the policing issue which addresses the needs of the customer at the same time. It is not about more money and resources but a process.
1,2843,1163,2303,we sort out clear accountibilities and responsibilities for activity &amp; delivery
1,2844,1106,2825,must understand detail of what HR &amp; FR deliver on OCUs - much is locally delivered personal service that is valued by staff
1,2845,1105,2809,both have equal importance
1,2846,1173,2805,centre must deliver expert prompt advice to front line managers - no fudging or delay-not the experience now
1,2847,1147,2738,Save a fortune in travel &amp; subs!
1,2848,1103,2794,look around you at the successful businesses. you may find this results in better support services
1,2849,1128,2802,new and cheaper ways of working means more automation can this sit with the widening mission and values of personal contact with the community can the neighbourhhood teams deliver in this environment
1,2850,1148,2786,introduce very visible accountability to the support services
1,2851,1150,2741,a concern regarding leading change, this is a complex process, do our senior managers understand the requirements/whole approach to leading change ? Do we have police officers driving change without truely understanding the modern approaches ?
1,2852,1171,2789,If we did this right we would reduce duplications. Most of which have happened as each OCU/business group has designed what it thinks is needed without asking what else already exists. There is no need to control assets to get the result you want.
1,2853,1160,2303,Please think again about shared service centres.  If you take the personal touch out of HR, budget management and health and safety these vital functions will not perform so well and that will knock on into our achievements and there will be costs like ETs and prosecutios.  These are not simply transactional functions.
1,2854,1116,2678,Recognise that not all the customers are willing customers, and that their views will necessarily reflect this.
1,2855,1103,2839,yes but a van driver may not want to become a clerk. so lets not fudge it and offer choices
1,2856,1108,2303,We always talk about savings where is the ROI [Return on investment] appraisal and bus&#039;benefits realisation plan from the service review
1,2857,1096,2799,I might even have the most appropriate skills!
1,2858,1092,2749,And risk management skills
1,2859,1163,2799,does everyone understand what their job is?
1,2860,1106,2824,but not wards
1,2861,1136,2303,fouc on performance and inspection? plese remember that whether its formal or not it still takes immense time and energy tp prepare and deal with the process which is often counter productive
1,2862,1155,2805,The Centre must empower staff to take responsibility and deliver a service they are proud of.
1,2863,1104,2303,manage the strategy. Don&#039;t talk about it and then put it on the shelf you have as much responsibility as everybody else
1,2864,1152,2837,Noy all managers are signed up to improvements, that&#039;s why you need a strong centre.
1,2865,1118,2303,Not to post capable and effective Police Officers to Metcall.  It is not an effective use of resources.  Put officers back out on the streets and let the police staff resources the telephone calls centres.
1,2866,1188,2303,my expectation is that MB will start to talk about information rather than intelligence which is just one policing purpose for which information is used
1,2867,1096,2830,what about ICG - mixed messages
1,2868,1175,2850,to all parts of the oranisation.  This continuation of an us and them mentality that is not helpful
1,2869,1095,2303,you do not know the current costs of the the current transaction costs, so how can you prove economies of scale. You have no evidence for this. If the transactions are the same, what efficiencies by putting them in one place? THis was in fact a decision taken behind close doors and the service review team were asked to justify it.
1,2870,1109,2754,Too many discussions about organisational change where senior people refuse to give up any BWT because they would then have fewer than the next area/person. Size is not everything. Very little effort to really examine why the current BWT exists, how people are used, and recognising that perhaps the number could decrease without impacting negatively on performance.
1,2871,1119,2695,where is prevention, ie youths from entering the cj system partnership is key
1,2872,1148,2848,Speak to any senior manager in Barclays and they will say it has failed
1,2873,1153,2844,exactly. need to understand exactly how we do things at present and what gaps are filled by local staff because of failures in current processes. Contracts need to be fit for purpose eg. a stationary contract that does next day delivery not next week.
1,2874,1121,2590,o have true customer focus we need a professional approach to actually finding out whatimpact we curently have.  We THINK we know what they want but do we really?
1,2875,1108,2825,Are we learning from other businesses that have devolved and centralised function like a see-saw. There is a danger if we get it wrong it will costs us more in the long run
1,2876,1133,2759,we also require some consistencies across business groups in terms of renumeration of senior staff and their responsibilities
1,2877,1094,2303,I will continue to liaise and have constructive dialogue with all business groups encouraging and empowering BME staff to take personal responsibility in effecting change. My strategic approach for the MPS to reflect the community we serve incorporates the mission for change.
1,2878,1153,2843,and sanctions
1,2879,1103,2815,costs???? Could be worse. Could move the support services to other part sof the uk or even overseas
1,2880,1132,2303,much more clarity over who is LEADING the information agenda. Is it Ailsa Beaton or Alan Brown
1,2881,1125,2590,where does information stop and intelligence begin?
1,2882,1161,2852,we need to get the balance right - experienced police staff, operationally credible police officers, ideas from outside the organisation business and community - the mix is critical
1,2883,1136,2866,how true!
1,2884,1121,2303,o assist with the spread of good practice
1,2885,1144,2590,perhaps we need to benchmark with and take lessons fron other service industries in the private sector that have achieved this e.g. hotel chains, airlines etc....
1,2886,1096,2866,hear hear
1,2887,1171,2590,Please ensure that we speak to senior personnel within the Lord Chancellor&#039;s dept., Probation service, Education, ALG and Primary Health care Trusts - much of what we&#039;re doing to improve performance and customer service includes these organisations as well  - we HAVE to stop the revolving door syndrome where we have one good initiative  but it falls over elsewhere within the &#039;system&#039;.
1,2888,1120,2303,Centrally managed performance data needs to reflect B/OCU needs ie detailed sub-unit information - otherwise B/OCUs will simply have to reinvent performance units by another name.
1,2889,1175,2876,and across the police/police staff divide
1,2890,1108,2769,what about the value statement, if we act in the way the previous comment infers we will lose the very thing that makes the MPS great its people
1,2891,1148,2827,We will need to ensure serious crime falls not just criminal damage and anti social behaviour
1,2892,1126,2853,I agree. Local delivery is at the heart of the new aproach, service centres apar to be counter productive.
1,2893,1150,2303,the centre should assist with the speed of change for example there are many staff  who are on restricted that want to leave, they are not buying into the change process, we need the centre to help all concerned at a faster pace.
1,2894,1153,2853,&quot;Personal&quot; doesn&#039;t necessarily need to be co-located
1,2895,1096,2866,and recognise information mgt skills
1,2896,1170,2713,what role do you have in this cascading of information? as a senior manager is it not best for you to keep your people in touch with the direction of the organisation?
1,2897,1142,2830,This shows a need to look at the MPS as a whole.  Greater efficiencies and effectiveness can be achieved by removing duplication.  There then needs to be a redirection of the freed-up staff to other areas which do not have sufficient resources.  Whilst there may be a reduction in staff performing the same functions it is not meant to &#039;cut&#039; but improve the quality of the function or service being delivered.
1,2898,1134,2295,be both patient and impatient
1,2899,1141,2821,This the sort of simplistic statement arising from service review based upon little or no undrstandingof the PNB its previous organisation the police council or the wider political picture let alone the legal staus of PNB.  The off the cuff comments of this type shows most clearly the weakness of the service review in the area of workforce modernisation
1,2900,1123,2840,Yes - Property Serbives are working closely with the Custody Directorate to get this right.  By building modern felxible clusters we can exit the old Victorian buildings as AB had just spoken about
1,2901,1166,2864,then remove the managers
1,2902,1095,2837,we need a new solution to the old problem of what to do with managers /leaders who fail, or who work against the organizatioanl objectives - devolved power is a nice principle but where is th real accountability for performance?
1,2903,1152,2303,Custody clusters must be close to patrol sites to make it work
1,2904,1104,2303,estate strategy is interesting. It takes months to get the most minor works started, let alone completed. Will we still be talking about this at the end of 3 years.
1,2905,1134,2295,continue to have courage to say outloud what others may still be reluctant to say
1,2906,1103,2793,agree....ish. If we are a modern organisation thn think about joint skills. To make a better police manager, a police officer actually learns new skills and changes their horizons by some time spent managing police s taff
1,2907,1153,2869,We do have information on the costs of processing invoices, etc locally as versus centrally via electronic means (and its cheaper but no less effective)
1,2908,1147,2303,IF the estate strategy has not delivered in the past 10 yrs (PFI costs) how are we going to move forward with a PSD who are demoralised &amp; always teeming &amp; lading with insufficient resources.
1,2909,1161,2799,this is some times difficult to do if staff are unable to fulfil thier role. There needs to be approprite support and supervision to ensure that we have an proffessional and effective service. Howevere we cannot messure success if we cannot monitor it.
1,2910,1106,2824,some believe that disenfranchisement understanding and dealing with it has nothing to do with CT and our operational response this is dangerous and a significant challenge to our safety.
1,2911,1150,2800,too many senior officers are concerned regarding their own career profile, I would like to see the focus be more on contribution to the MPS
1,2912,1132,2800,that will be a first
1,2913,1123,2874,Is is what they want or what they need
1,2914,1163,2895,i agree
1,2915,1094,2303,To be accessible, for the centre to be more representative with the right persons from the respective minority groups visibly supported respected and equipped to assist stragically to move the agenda forward
1,2916,1103,2853,personal is not where i see some of our hr officers
1,2917,1128,2865,agree but if the first cuts are within the police staff numbers then this situation will remain a high risk
1,2918,1136,2590,one thing i have not heard is about the snt locally driven priorities our targets are becoming too top dowm removing capacity to delivery at a truely local level
1,2919,1109,2865,We heard a story from the MPA about a police officer helping to change a tyre - made a fantastic impression on him, but is this a proper use of police resources or powers?
1,2920,1137,2887,Don&#039;t just tell me - inspire me
1,2921,1152,2303,Policy takes a minimum of 13 weeks to develop, we must be less bureacratic
1,2922,1163,2880,how do we distinguish between intelligence &amp;information?
1,2923,1106,2303,Estate modernisation - great idea but experience with delivering SNT bases suggests beyond scope of MPS at present
1,2924,1129,2735,But it is  for SNT
1,2925,1175,2799,are we ready to accept a new approach to poor performers - in other organisation those who perform stay and those who don&#039;t have to leave
1,2926,1121,2741,How do we get rid of thosenot performing.
1,2927,1161,2837,we do but under performing ocu&#039;s need support to improve if they cannot then ocu commanders need to be removed not promoted
1,2928,1095,2303,please, please no more cliches
1,2929,1110,2303,really happy to deliver but need the centre to clear the path. i.e. if we are to modernise our workforce then get us out of the pnb
1,2930,1149,2904,I take it that it will cater for all staff ...
1,2931,1171,2295,Share the responsibility of finding innovtive ways forward with my staff  - they usually have the best ideas !!!!
1,2932,1156,2794,Decisions need to be made fast efore we loose the best staff and disilusionment sets in for others
1,2933,1142,2867,At a time of such change should we be decreasing our internal capability.  External consultants are far more expensive and lack organisational knowledge
1,2934,1112,2890,There are plenty of new people out there!  It is bizarre to thin we should keep the same workforce for 30 years.
1,2935,1145,2303,Corporate strategy is about making long-term decisions not short-term ones regardless of the budget pressures.
1,2936,1131,2590,Is this a good method interacting. I spend all day fending off e-mails and now I&#039;m interacting with my senior colleagues by typing. So much for networking. I&#039;d like to engage in debate
1,2937,1151,2908,evidence of best value should drive PSD performance eg entering into contracts with no penalty clauses for slippage
1,2938,1116,2295,By ensuring that Professional Standards  bonds with &#039;Together&#039;
1,2939,1106,2888,This right. The abolition of OCU units leaves us unable to conduct performance reviews.  Centrally a blip in performance will be idetified but we need staff to help us sort out why.
1,2940,1104,2801,I need to understand what the centre means, nobody knows what the Deputy Commissioner or his command is responsible for
1,2941,1113,2590,you talked a lot about internal change and the changing face of policing. Do Londoners want a chnging face, or the same face and better standards?
1,2942,1109,2922,information of all sorts can be turned into intelligence, but is not intelligence per se
1,2943,1103,2932,decisions are taken and we want to keep our beat hr people
1,2944,1127,2825,The removal of Police stations from communities will have a negative impact on local delivery and re-assurance!
1,2945,1152,2866,How will the centre develop and implement changes when some HQ teams are being significantly reduced? Madness
1,2946,1155,2746,Less MB INFIGHTING
1,2947,1160,2894,Of course it does!  An example - both commendation ceremonies and absence management strategies are more successful and have a better impact on morale if the staff organising them know their people well.
1,2948,1173,2825,people need to know exactly what these will be - staff will be asking and we do not hav aclear picture/srtucture yet
1,2949,1161,2880,or DAC Bryan or the Deputy Commissioner?
1,2950,1133,2888,Fine, if the Centre can deiver the right details at the right time at the right speed
1,2951,1168,2295,Time deadlines on support functions must be strictly adhered to, viz custody hubs commissioned, built and opened within x period.  Otherwise we will over promise but be too long in the delivery. Strict programme management must be demanded of all. There is no argument about the what I need to feel confident the how,s will arrive as promised and on time.  If we did much in July we need to do the same on this.
1,2952,1103,2946,give me an example that you have witnessed
1,2953,1123,2590,Customer focus could lead to the euphamism &quot;a camel is a horse designed by committee&quot; Whilst it is important that we listen and respond, we must also have corporate standard of response that does not create 32 &quot;post code lottery&quot; models of delivery. We must also work with the public to ensure that they understand what we can deliver - not just what they want.
1,2954,1146,2769,at a time when we about a huge part of our corporate memory i find this bizarre!
1,2955,1125,2926,reorganise to be efficient and effective and them make redundant those who don&#039;t fit the roles
1,2956,1112,2944,This is about increasing our presence - not removing police stations.  Find out about what the Estates Strategy means.
1,2957,1142,2294,Service review have assinged leads for the various strands but who will lead on the 7 corporate priorities?
1,2958,1117,2303,The centre should plan the changes required in a coherent and coordinated way, ensuring the resources are allocated appropriately (visible and robustly) to deliver the benefits.
1,2959,1150,2590,an organisation that looks  after its staff is more likely to look after its customers.
1,2960,1149,2824,And the more we move that way the more we will need to listen and amend our plans to meet local need and needs of partners -- are we really ready to do that?
1,2961,1148,2294,it must be relevant to our experience of working life
1,2962,1157,2796,ok then lets see the willingness to do this - perhaps we should publicise the first member of management board to say ok i am prepared to accept that i have to do soemthing different even if it means that i have to give up some of my power base - the commissioiner needs EVERYONES support and that icludes his top team.
1,2963,1115,2295,If Stephen Rimmer is going to be leading on Service Review, it would have been useful to have heard him speak at this conference.
1,2964,1161,2939,there is a system being piloted which will deliver this I do not think there is any plan to remove MIUs until it is in place
1,2965,1151,2303,Staff morale is not helped by disloyalty at ACPO ranks at the centre - &#039;together&#039; should be demonstrated at the top levels of the organisation.
1,2966,1133,2923,We have had great support from PSD for SN
1,2967,1147,2923,We need PSD to become a cohesive outfit
1,2968,1192,2884,we need to ensure that the organisation is capturing &#039;what works&#039; as well as what does not. Internal and external
1,2969,769,2812,Is this comment just about police staff? Are there no &#039;dead wood&#039; police officers and if so how can we make these redundant?
1,2970,1121,2303,f we had a modern pay structure for officers we could avoid the over use of non warranted staff - this would then mean we could afford to keep officers and retain the flexibilty to respond to crisis - who will lead this
1,2971,1095,2634,that is just the kind of blinkered arrogance i meant
1,2972,1152,2830,have we not done what we said we wouldn&#039;t i.e sleep walk into delivering this stuff with the same resources?
1,2973,1159,2295,Learn from the past to inform the future.  Use the expereince and knowledge within and outside the service to find the path.  Not rush in to decisions as they affect peoples careers and lives.  Value our people.
1,2974,1125,2749,these are PM skills!!!!
1,2975,1127,2295,&quot;Walk the Talk&quot; and listen/respond to individuals concerns re the proposed changes and do not just do it to them!
1,2976,1126,2295,if you are proposing to take away HR, finance etc you will lose the sense of responsibility that comes with having it locally. it will no longer be the managements problem if things go wrong hr wise
1,2977,1129,2793,strategy asks for citzen focus, not a customer focus. not clear who/what customer cf citizen is
1,2978,1110,2590,Take care with year on year success (Commissioner speaking about crime reduction in HT).  This sort of comparison can come back and bite next year.  More long term crime comparison may better reflect the community as well as focussing on what they say.
1,2979,1133,2785,admitting we got it wrong is important
1,2980,1190,2955,How do we make police officers redundant?
1,2981,1144,2590,We need to run the police service more like a business as per the private sector
1,2982,1103,2899,step into a new way of working.
1,2983,1103,2981,.......meaning whT??
1,2984,769,2794,Having a good HR manager is a key resource, we should be able to select our own. Central support is ok if all give the same answer and level of support.
1,2985,1103,2981,MEANING WHAT?
1,2986,1190,2963,Absolkutely agree
1,2987,1133,2952,hard to witness behind closed doors
1,2988,1104,2746,there is no acknowleged top level &#039;business&#039; forum to drive through business change and the right resource allocation mechanism
1,2989,1173,2303,I am not clear what the service centres will include.  Has this been defined?
1,2990,1156,2303,Right people right place right atitude-how will we reward those managers who deliver above those who exist/maintain the status quo?  How will MB demonstrate its trust in local senior managers to deliver?<br />We are bing asked to deliver as private industry but have few of the tools-rewards and sanctions/ability to loose ineffective/inefficient staff etc.
1,2991,1192,2590,the language used is wrong. Delivering what the customer wants is performing!
1,2992,1150,2590,the current PDR system for TP OCU Commanders are purely focussed on 3 crime reduction and one TNO detection, if we are truely concerned regarding customer focus this needs to be enshrined in new performance for all leaders, with the reward recognition systems geared to this new approach
1,2993,1191,2294,The proposed leaders of the Service Review clearly do not represent the fundamental need for diversity.in the MPS. Visibly the &quot;leaders&quot; comprise less than 10 members of ethnic minority members of the MPSv and an apprant token presence perhaps one or two women per table.<br />The key speakers are nearly all white men. Plus ca change, plus c&#039;est le meme chose. The MPS must look and sound as if it is inclusive as it approached the future.<br />What does the Board see as the future of the Service Review if it cannot reflect the need for diversity in the review conference itself?
1,2994,1193,2768,we are an information rich organisation but particularly poor in making this available to our staff. We need a knowledge management strategy that uses effective communication to achieve a knowledge sharing situation
1,2995,1138,2295,the energy levels in this room, which is full of - largely full of white men - do not so far fill me with optmism so far
1,2996,1149,2933,and they charge you to tell you the time
1,2997,1164,2303,professional support and guidance not rule enforcement
1,2998,1192,2747,a great way to stiffle debate
1,2999,1173,2295,Committed to culture change but uncertain about how to make it happen
1,3000,1133,2933,and tend to find more work for themselves. paralysis by analysis
1,3001,1145,2294,Need to ensure that all staff are given a clear understanding of what it really means, (not just headlines) and can see advantages and personal opportunities.
1,3002,1128,2856,are the savings real - will they ever happen
1,3003,1163,2295,A comprehensive series of briefings accross all parts of the OCU and partners. What would be of value would be a single corporate product.
1,3004,1193,2768,consider why the Metro, Sun nespapers are successful. we need to tailor our corporate messages in a style that ALL our staff understand and actually find interesting.
1,3005,1152,2901,How will the centre develop and implement change if the resouces (staff) have been reduced? madness
1,3006,1160,2842,Influencing how PPAF is constructed is critical. We have not  had a high enough profile, or sufficient influence, in this work. The component metrics within PPAF are simplistic and do not accurately reflect the delicate and complex balance of policing yet this tool drives everything we do, and how well we are seen to do it.
1,3007,1173,2303,need confidence that difficult decsions will be taken including around staffing issues
1,3008,1127,2303,Claer and visible leadership.  Centre needs to ENGAGE with the process and be part it
1,3009,1190,2590,We need to recognise who our customers are. Many support services are divorced from front line policing, and so their custotmers are internal - but just as valid.
1,3010,1193,2294,The strategy needs to be in a simple language that everyone understands. we need to make it real for people so that everyone knows how they contribute.
1,3011,1124,2303,We cannot concentrate on outcomes when we dont know what the constraints are. We want to act like business but we are the only business that sets strategy and targets without knowing what our resources are. Citizen focused outcomes will always be more than we can expect to deliver. This is why strategy fails.
1,3012,1146,2303,Clarity of message. Significant concern that Mid Term Financial Plan cuts will be misinterpreted by workforce as an SR measure.  Don&#039;t use SR as a trojan horse for other necessary unpopular measures; it will challenge the integrity of SR.
1,3013,1133,2981,Like ENRON?
1,3014,1190,2294,Why is &#039;old&#039; corporate strategy being dismissed? If the Met is so good, it can&#039;t all have been wrong.
1,3015,1190,2295,From the shop floor
1,3016,1133,2995,speak for yourself
1,3017,1190,2737,visit more police staff centres
1,3018,1124,2295,We need convincing business cases on what the benefits of these changes are.  They are words at the moment we need to know detailed savings and details on  where these savings will be used. Only then will our people be convinced.
1,3019,1127,2619,Isn&#039;t the resourcing and funding of a trerrorists incident/investigation a national responsibility??
1,3020,1095,2663,greater inflence at Govt level, make a stand, if we want to ensure citizen focus becomes a reality then ensure the issues for the public are reflected in our PI&#039;s, &#039;what gets measured gets done&#039; . simlify our perfromance targets
1,3021,1106,2852,unfortunately my experience of the MPS is such that if you don&#039;t control the assets you don&#039;t get the service you want.
1,3022,1094,2303,Not to revert to short term panics over small blips in crime figures that devalue the longer gameplan. Witness the beginning of this year when burglary and street crime rose and the &quot;widening mission&quot; became very narrow and we were micro- managed from the top down
1,3023,1115,2817,Apart from Management Board of course !!
1,3024,1106,2925,has anyone successfully challenged poor performance in the MPS with its hugely bureaucratic and rule based approached to people management
1,3025,1128,2963,is stephen rimmer going to lead on the morris observation around police regulation framework and modernising this into employment law framework? we are now looking at another bureauoctic layer of police officer ie police trainees on contracts
1,3026,1147,2738,Too much of gravy train mind set.
1,3027,1148,2590,where are the plans for co=location/multi agency one stop shops for delivering best service to community-especially for vulnerable victims
1,3028,1106,2303,The success of 7/7 was delivered by empowered, motivated and trained staff working towards a common goal free from common bureaucracy and rules. You need to find a way to replicate this for day to day business
1,3029,1108,2793,there are a lot of officers in non police jobs who would give anything to be able to do a worthwhile fullfilling job, but due to lack of imagination and the rigid application of policy plus the BWT restrictions are forced to wither on the vine, we must individuly risk assess, seek clarification around &#039;blanket no contact &#039; assesments and think out of the box. If officers on restricted duties were removed from OCU BWT&#039;s and placed on a virtual OCU all would be solved, pay disparity, fulfilling roles and general acceptance
1,3030,1159,2295,lets start by giving managers some management training
1,3031,1148,2871,additional funding and resource committment through LAAs for PPO schemes
1,3032,1145,2747,That wouldn&#039;t leave many!
1,3033,1115,2928,You can take a horse to water - but you can&#039;t stop it using cliches.
1,3034,1145,2303,That it leads and takes the tough decisons i.e. stop putting officers in charge of projects they do not have the skills to deliver
1,3035,1158,2918,there needsto be an understanding of SN at all levels of BOCUs, not just from the practioners at the ground level.
1,3036,1133,2735,not true. ask the victims. they want a fast response that meets their needs
1,3037,1171,2808,We need to work better with each other but our focus must always be on what the people of London/Uk are going to get in terms of service.
1,3038,1188,2981,meaning properly accountable for spend, efficiency and respondng to what the customer wants/needs?
1,3039,1125,2303,To lead and direct, set the framework within which others can work, and then monitor as necessary.
1,3040,1119,2303,continuity - management, consistency, people keep moving and you end up with lots of brooms
1,3041,1171,3003,This can be prepared bassed on todays presentation?
1,3042,1151,2500,acceptance that troop on the ground will not understand or accept that this is the right way forward. Their views do not involve strategies etc but the day to day demands of response policing
1,3043,1194,2303,To critically analyse why such similar initiatives and aspirations in the past have not succeeded
1,3044,1104,2825,scope of what functions we intend to deliver in a Service Centre needs to be considered carefully
1,3045,1117,2303,sharing of good practice and quickly. Often find start doing something and then find change from centre upsets the apple cart
1,3046,1117,2303,Feedback and support
1,3047,1118,2888,BOCU needs are often divorced from the corporate information requirements required of external stakeholders. BOCUs need to recognise that failing to play as a team causes enormous difficulties for the Met. All levels must play as team.
1,3048,1159,2732,my staff have an office in a basement with no windows, the air con has not worked for 3 years and during a hot spell this summer the temperatures reached 90 degress. everyone we have complained to has ignored us, would you expect to work in such conditions. how can I get 100 percent from my staff when we show them no respect or dignity. I don&#039;t care about immunity, please help the staff in the basement at YE.i
1,3049,1126,2303,primacy of deliververy is the boroughs- why are we taking issues away from the boroughs?
1,3050,1188,2793,It depends what they are doing in those offices.  If it adds value and is derived from their experience then the Service benefits.
1,3051,1192,2296,How were we allowed / or did we allow ourselves to let the budget become so unbalanced?
1,3052,1103,2976,YOU MISUNDERSTAND HOW IT WILL WORK
1,3053,1096,2296,Is the only way to stop recruiting?
1,3054,1161,3051,because the mps have mis-managed it for the last 170 years
1,3055,1103,3030,have you not had any. i would be surprised
1,3056,1096,2296,Surely not by seting business group against business group!
1,3057,1112,2296,Someone really needs to explain why we are in this financial position.  It is not clear
1,3058,1175,2298,we could start by identifying what they are now
1,3059,1192,3053,No, but it is a short-term easy option to take
1,3060,1150,2297,we need to increase police activity regarding confiscation, forfeiture POCA, and ensure that the resources gained are put back to front line policing
1,3061,1112,3057,I agree.  We need to learn the lessons and not just plough on.
1,3062,1132,3053,we need to ensure that we can turn the tap back on given the demographics of the next 5-7 yrs
1,3063,1148,2297,By learning lessons from past failures to set budgets realistically and consult with budget holders as part of the process
1,3064,1125,2298,clear out the silos and duplication across the whole organisation, then put a new structure in place with the best people in the right roles. Bite the bullet and make those left redundant.
1,3065,1112,3057,I agree too.  Staff will play their part if they understand why
1,3066,1188,2942,all information is intelligence.It&#039;s just the use you put it to.
1,3067,1096,3051,Major delivery programmes must be properly costed and resourced, and managed corporately - not undertaken on a shoestring within business groups.  This means prioritising, stopping doing things and clear accountability for spend and benefit realisation.
1,3068,1140,2303,it is about time HR/Finance/DOI/Resources  were intergrated into single facilities management structure. IT allows us to do this
1,3069,1103,3053,the thing that is not helping is overprotection of budgets and poor forecasting. we must be farmore robust
1,3070,1104,2298,why do we promote people and then keep them in post
1,3071,1161,2992,Absolutely.  We need the performance (organisation) and performance (personal) linked up with the PDRs, rewards etc linked to quality of delivery, not just the reduction and detection targets
1,3072,1168,2296,Central look at LAA&#039;s.  Allow local flexibility and leadership but give a realistic framework for engagement.  Viz. Combined activities may need charging out of certain police time in partnership activities.  Close central eye on performance reward grants both from LPSA&#039;s and new LAA&#039;s may bring extra added value or cost replacement.
1,3073,1192,3067,yes-   evidence-based prioritisation is crucial
1,3074,1132,2297,ensure that the estate and infrastructure costs are reduced early within the service review
1,3075,1103,3065,....it will mean redundancy
1,3076,1096,3067,This is exactly why we need programme management skills - they are different from operational policing skills
1,3077,1125,3067,absolutely right
1,3078,1155,2296,Do we truly know where the money is and who has authority to spend
1,3079,1175,3070,what do you mean?
1,3080,1191,2297,how much does each Borough spend year on year.?<br />Have we ever attempted to quantify the cost of crime prevention strategies as compared to the cost of detection?<br />Does the MPS Property Services Department discuss disposals with the local Borough and the Crime Reduction Partners to identify the local  needs with Projects with young people?<br />Does the Property Services Department identify how they can facilitate the work of the Safer Neighbourhood teams.?
1,3081,1148,2297,Start with top down management review why 5 ACs as well as directors replacing ACs.
1,3082,1163,2296,Ask government for the &pound;70m for Op Theseus
1,3083,1095,2927,and put where, doing what?
1,3084,1146,2296,I thought that kiosk was dismantled last week?
1,3085,1104,2298,why do we continue to allow poor manages to manage budgets - replace those who fail to come in on budget
1,3086,1168,2296,Invest to save leading to possible capital borrowing and then divestment of assets.
1,3087,1150,2297,There is enormous potential for savings without pain by just cutting down on wastage; cut the over ordering mentality , I want (not need change the throw away mentality that pervades the MPS. Cost Morality must be a key thread of the future
1,3088,1145,2296,In order to balance resources we need to make senior members of staff truly accountable for spend and ensure that all spends are truly based on need and driving the business.  This means less &quot;ego spending&quot;, it is not for senior staff to spend money on toys or kit because they want it.  Why do ACPO officers have to have offices refurbed so frequently.  Treat money as if it were own cash and not a bottomless pit of money.
1,3089,1192,3064,we should not leap to restructuring as the automatic answer. Changing culture and how we do things is just as important as the structure
1,3090,1149,3072,Where does that stop? Does each agency charge for their time? LAA&#039;s will increase expectation on delivery from us.
1,3091,1104,3070,you pay a higher rate for the same piece of work
1,3092,1169,2297,increase income overall not just poca but bocu cdrp funding plus charging for services we are often good to deliver a service but not to send the bill
1,3093,1192,3080,not just cost, but cost/benefit
1,3094,1115,3084,It&#039;s now been converted into the Borough Commander&#039;s office.
1,3095,1153,3051,We grew too quickly to satisfy political aims around police numbers and are now reaping the full cost impact
1,3096,1096,2297,Do we know our age profile?  How much of a contribution will normal retirement make?
1,3097,1119,2297,We need to xplore the partnerships - ie ODPM neighourhood renewal, CDRPs funding for police partnerships in communities - a funding officer in each bocu
1,3098,1132,2296,up to date accurate financial data presented in ONE clear doc would enable decision making to a far better standard
1,3099,1148,2297,By not micro managing pennies ie hire cars and concentrate on the waste in PSD and other large projects.
1,3100,1188,2695,Need to understand the context in which CDRPs are working: Recognise the impact of Local Area Agreements and be able to respond
1,3101,1140,3081,i agree management board is a big committee with strong egos
1,3102,1157,3082,that has been done several times with the support of MPA--treasury thinks we can find the money from existing budget
1,3103,1125,3089,keeping the same structures contributes to keeping the old culture
1,3104,1159,2296,I am a Londoner and live in an outer Borough, if I need to visit a police station after 10pm at night ther is only one  open on the entire Borough. this is some 10 miles away and I have no personal transport. Shutting police stations may save money but destrys public confidence, discourages crime reporting and has a vast negative effect on the public!!
1,3105,1114,3099,hire cars are managed disgracefully and we all know
1,3106,1153,3094,Visibility at last.
1,3107,1145,2298,Need to examine pay strategy for police staff.  Pay rates, particularly at lower levels not sufficient to retain good staff.  Band D rates very poor and do not reflect the contribution first line managers make.  If we had better pay strategy we could afford to cut numbers of staff.  Too many poor performers who should be got rid off and pay more to those that deliver.
1,3108,1103,3098,it is a &pound;3bn budget. It is complex and not as suuccinct as your own bank balance that lends itself to a simple statement
1,3109,1136,3074,it and other corp services have too high a cost at a local level eg &pound;400 for a pc world memory upgrade they charge &pound;75 for?
1,3110,1140,3070,we seem to be selecting senior staff without any selection process - is this fair
1,3111,1145,2296,Much greater scrutiny required of spends requiring real analysis of benefits of expenditure.
1,3112,1153,3098,There is up to date infomation available via MetFIN in standardised reports - your finance mngr should be giving you them
1,3113,1138,2296,why buy a second pound.  Make people get rid of the vehicles.  it is out of sight out of mind
1,3114,1157,3099,if you think hire cars is only pennies you must be living on another planet
1,3115,1125,2298,too many consultants liftd our &#039;people&#039; based costs
1,3116,1148,2298,a bit more drive and delivery on the estate strategy followed up by DoI just as quickly
1,3117,1149,2296,cut down on needless overtime
1,3118,1172,3104,why would anyone want to visit a police stn after 10pm
1,3119,1094,2296,we have to make choices - we try to do everything, the organisation is over-extended
1,3120,1153,3104,what about the telephone or internet?
1,3121,1095,3085,and do what with them?
1,3122,1145,2296,Must ensure that MB lead by example and treat corporate funds with respect.
1,3123,1117,2298,We need properly trained and waged budget managers who can balance the budgets for us. we are not experts
1,3124,1103,3117,......needless? You are the manager. Are you authorising needless ot.
1,3125,1094,2296,we need to shift resources to reflect the new reality
1,3126,1157,3081,resilience is a key issue  over the summer i can assure you they were all needed
1,3127,1192,3080,need to remember benefits of prevention can often not be measured in the short term -in financial terms - or atributed to a specific initiative as often it is the &#039;sum of the parts&#039;
1,3128,1153,3102,correction the Treasury think the Home Office should find the money not necessarily the MPS
1,3129,1161,3070,i agree, junior posts are hayed and advertised, the nearer the top of the organisation you get the less there is any fair process.  this reduces all our credibility.
1,3130,1132,3084,all very intereting however at some stage in the past a decision was made not to train middle and senior managers (ie junior command course etc) and we have a tranche of semi skilled managers. Skill us up give us the tools trust us
1,3131,1103,3122,give example
1,3132,1175,3115,do we know what our real people based costs are to make this claim?
1,3133,1120,3085,Bur first we need to ensure budgets are properly and fairly  set, so that they are achievable at all
1,3134,1112,3102,And they are probably right.
1,3135,1133,3118,ask the public - they will explain
1,3136,1145,2296,We must cut waste and profigacy, as a London resident and council tax payer am appalled at what is allowed to happen.
1,3137,1140,2297,integrate doi/hr/resources/  .... lots of managers and support resources saved
1,3138,1153,3088,Plus some sanctions
1,3139,1117,2303,Please support boroughs more by coming out-need good advice
1,3140,1160,2297,the key is to cut out the overspending from this year
1,3141,1159,3118,whoever made the last comment has quite clearly never been a shift worker and  lives in a fantasy world where everyone works mon-fri 9am - 5pm or is an MPS manager.
1,3142,1103,3130,you are a snior manager. grow up
1,3143,1148,3126,Still seems to be a 25 tog comfort blanket, there are 35 other ACPO
1,3144,1112,3106,Let&#039;s build 31,000
1,3145,1094,2296,we need better figures - i dont trust what iget told - more data quality issues
1,3146,1125,3132,yes in the department I&#039;m in
1,3147,1157,3136,what are you doing about it
1,3148,1146,2296,How much does the free-travel facility cost, is this a sustainable benefit to a part of the MPS?
1,3149,1161,3098,it needs to be integrated with other information OCU cmdrs are looking at not remote on MetFIN
1,3150,1145,2296,stop spending money on things that are less critical than others - simple!
1,3151,1096,3122,Supporting Keith&#039;s suggestion of cost morality
1,3152,1148,3143,there only seemed to be half a dozen at the time
1,3153,1106,3087,how much does leaving computors switched on 24/7 cost while in empty offuces.  We have waste everywhere
1,3154,1159,3120,Nothing like a personal touch, some people like to talk to a human face.
1,3155,1115,3126,May be room here to provide a contract for seasonal working?
1,3156,1145,2296,What budget problem? When we get to March just watch the money that&#039;s available
1,3157,1104,3104,we could open the counter and have staff occupied in a building to deal with one or two people a week. I asked my community and they wanted the officer out on the street so that the officer could go to them
1,3158,769,3099,Where is the Vehicle Fleet Review?
1,3159,1192,2297,How does all this cost-cutting sit with the corporate strategy? We have to recognise that some upfront investment is required to enable us to find longer-term gains (in performance, reduced running costs and increased effectiveness). At the same time as we are being asked to become more efficient/effective and change, we are also having to find large sums of money immediately, which means we make short-term cuts without considering the LT consequences. None of which is strategic
1,3160,1117,2297,Can work with partners particularly local authority improve situation-need to influence treasury. ODPM and home office. They need to be joined up
1,3161,1103,3125,that  is called service review
1,3162,1168,2297,Proper workforce modernisation and local flexibility(borough) to manage to bottom line icluding pay.
1,3163,1116,2297,Can we encourage/train people to manage and spend as if they were running their own businesses with their own money?
1,3164,1103,3148,cost us a lot more if we get rid of it.
1,3165,1106,3087,Did Theseus generate waste?
1,3166,1148,3114,If we were allowed to spend and buy cars then we might save something
1,3167,1153,3137,worth exploring, should produce more effective services as well
1,3168,1157,3143,MB is 12 people in total=a large number of boroughs have a higher mumber of people on their SMTs
1,3169,1145,2298,Flexible working requires technology to support it - this costs money. Also the organisation is not mature enough for this as we still have a culture of if your not in your not working! Senior staff are expected to be at their desks every day waiting for the phone to ring!
1,3170,1149,3148,yes and would it not be good if it was extended to all of us who make up one team met
1,3171,1136,3081,the mps has a different police structure because it is unique in being a regional force. we must ensure our structure best aligns to deliver not argue about individual senior posts.
1,3172,1192,3088,Agree - there must be more accountability for ACPO spending
1,3173,1152,3150,Such as?
1,3174,1146,3104,Classic paraocial thinking, try using all the technology available. Why would you visit a station after 10pm?
1,3175,1104,3121,build budget performance into their own pdr - fail to deliver then sack them and get those who can manage in - we have too many in effective managers !
1,3176,1194,3117,Where is the overtime being spent. Is it on core policing or is it in other areas. If we cut overtime what is the impact on the service we deliver. Is the spend myth or relaity - is there a benefit to covering with overtime compared to staffing up
1,3177,1153,3165,inevitably but operation had to take primacy
1,3178,1145,2296,We say we are too big. Other large organisations are very lean and use their size as an advantage; not view it as a disadvantage! We need to get a different mentality - more private sector thinking.
1,3179,1150,3165,Yes, lots of duplication of material and goods requests. We need to learn to be much more joined up, no matter the size of the challenge.
1,3180,1145,2296,The organisation needs to get to grips with the concept of spending in order to derive longer term benefits.
1,3181,1136,3143,isn&#039;t this an issue thats wider than just acpo we should inc senior police staff posts and rationalise both parts which may actually require reductions in some areas but growth elsewhere
1,3182,1175,3137,we could have it run by a police officer then!
1,3183,1161,3156,thats because you get bailed out by the government and the tax payers pay for your incomptence
1,3184,1096,3159,And how does it fit with Together?
1,3185,1117,2296,We are always predicting an overspend at this point in the year, our financial systems and forecasting skills are not sufficiently sophisticated to feed Management Bd with reliable information on which to base decision making.
1,3186,1159,3157,Why are you not making use of Police Staff in your station office as opposedto an officer!!  How many officers are employed on restricted duties that could also be utilised rather than hiding them away doing useless jobs, eg the 12 months I spent doing PNC checks.
1,3187,769,3113,Stolen cars get recovered to car pounds, where they have a forensic examination. This leads to dectections and as criminals don&#039;t specialise in crime type we catch a range of offenders.
1,3188,1106,2297,I thought we were working on three year budgets
1,3189,1103,3178,i don&#039;t think anyone is saying we are too big or thinking of it as disadvantage. This is the first time i have heard this said. We can learn form the private sector but we are a PUBLIC service and need to balance this carefully raher than jsut see alternatives - without really knowing what they mean - as the answer.
1,3190,1133,3141,or citizen focused
1,3191,1168,2298,Greater mix of part and fully sworn patrol asset.
1,3192,1103,3185,agree
1,3193,1096,3159,Budget reductions and re-direction are all compatible with the corporate strategy if you use it as a basis for decision-making
1,3194,1133,3174,you may not but we should ask and find out first
1,3195,1117,2296,Are we still recruiting more officers than we were funded for? is one target being exceeded at the expense of another?
1,3196,1192,3193,yes, but we are not using it this way
1,3197,1145,3156,I absolutely agree, budgets are not based on need, but allow some people to stockpile cash which is then spent very unwisely at the end of the financial year.
1,3198,1133,3183,You?
1,3199,1119,3095,true
1,3200,1166,3060,Put pressure on OCUs to use the financial investigators properly. There should be PIs developed. the MPS is missing opportunities - it is also v good PR to demonstrate that we take assets fron local yobs as well as criminal networks.
1,3201,1163,2298,look at costs across end to end process improvement not cutting costs in business units
1,3202,1159,3120,not everyone has the  internet or a telephone, also consider the difficulties with language now that London has an ever increasing foreign population
1,3203,1096,3064,Agree but with the most appropriately skilled people in the jobs
1,3204,769,3181,I wonder  which area the growth will be police or police staff?
1,3205,1127,2297,Counter Terrorism is a national responsibility to fund and resource!!!!
1,3206,1132,2298,be very clear regarding which units we require in their current format to support the new strategy. what units need to change, and which do we nolongerneed as do noy support the new thinking
1,3207,1126,2298,Give us greater flexibility over police numbers - anything other than policepay is only trimming around the edges
1,3208,1194,2296,So what&#039;s the message - where&#039;s the clarity between budgets and Service Review
1,3209,1150,2297,the licensing act will increase demand on policing, the centre should look to influence the Home Office/partners to contribute, we should also look at section 106 planning act , to add contributions to policing
1,3210,1136,3058,agree that its impt to understand what this means and the drivers for the expenditure eg the true cost of aid to boro is huge and prevents local delvery over time this will get worse a ring fencing snt increases amount falling elsewhere
1,3211,1127,2297,POCA &pound; to be recycled directly back into front line police enforcement.
1,3212,1133,3115,agree - we need to learn from experinence and grow our own talent
1,3213,1169,2297,a collection will take place at the end of the session credit cards taken gift aid forms available
1,3214,1130,3060,I agree, but POCA activity must be mainstreamed throughout the MPS, which will require some initial investment. All the research shows a potential criminal economy of &pound;20-40 billion - much of it in London. We need to target the assets - not just for the return but because it will reduce crime.
1,3215,1096,2298,We must work smarter - use the technology.  All should have open calendars and use the shared directory file plan - reduces duplication by a huge factor
1,3216,1173,2297,make sure that IB look at total project costs - including insurance
1,3217,1104,2297,what happens if the GLA don&#039;t redirect the &pound;2 billion for the Safer Neighbourhoods rollout?
1,3218,1146,3186,Try getting support from OH to have a Restricted-duty officer at a front counter
1,3219,1142,2296,A lot of the suggested MTFP savings are reducing staff numbers.  Where will the staff move to or will the growth bids cover the losses? Are these real savings
1,3220,1103,3140,glad you are listening
1,3221,1135,3107,define core business then stop doing non core
1,3222,1117,3058,and then benchmark. benchmark with other forces, particularly on discrete areas of activity
1,3223,1161,3139,who would you like to come out from the centre more often to support you?
1,3224,1152,3200,Trouble is we only get 1/6th of the return. Need to put pressure on Govt to change us.
1,3225,1136,3210,the lack of risk mangement reducing aid committments needs to be addressed
1,3226,1141,2298,what about capping?
1,3227,1161,2303,what are our expectations of the MPA
1,3228,1126,2298,ensure that boroughs have an accountant or the like to manage budgets - borough commanders are given huge budgets yet are not provided with any budget management training.
1,3229,1096,2298,Reduce private office staff.  There are PAs with assistants.
1,3230,1144,3178,what about our ludicrously exspensive outsourced contracts?
1,3231,1145,2297,Why have HQ branches been allowed to have budgets which are out of all proportion to work delivered, the delivery end (boroughs) have so little access to money in comparison, no wonder staff are keen to leave when they therefore have so little access to decent kit and training opportunites.  Staff working in key delivery areas must not be treated as second class citizens - they are key to delivery and must have access to a fair share of assets.
1,3232,1106,2296,Theseus is a national issue that played out in the capital city, why should MPS absorb all the cost. Should there be a topslice from other forces that would reimburse the MPS to a point where some money could be rolled forward to next year.
1,3233,1163,2297,start looking at delivering the real benefits from change programmes - what we do is invest in a new piece of kit but never drive out the real benefits so overall the whole process costs more not less?
1,3234,1094,3122,Impressed with Empress, Impressed with the the transition however, how comes it takes so long to gain a pass to enter my place of work
1,3235,1129,3113,To facilitate the forensic examination of vehicles that are the subject of crime
1,3236,1161,3155,yes please
1,3237,1135,3107,reward functional responsibility not management responsibility
1,3238,1127,3226,good point is a 5.5% increase on precept likely ot acceptable to central government
1,3239,1148,2296,no sacred cows, so that we deliver Safer neighbourhoods for the Cr, and prevent the unchallenged complacency of pre 7/7
1,3240,1157,3201,we have a system called abc activity based costing. i have not heard anyone mention this - it can wk if we want it to.it does however ask soemawkward questuons that we ave to answer - this is ther crux of this debate. if you are seriuus about costing things the world might look different !!
1,3241,1151,2590,which customer has priority<br />one member of the public can have an influence if they are literate and have an ability to gather support on a political format which can then place unwaranted demands on resources
1,3242,1112,3085,Does that mean sacking the Management Board?
1,3243,1117,2297,Need to be clear about budget setting not just relying on history to inform budget allocations-daft way of doing business
1,3244,1103,3182,oh it will be alright then!
1,3245,1135,3107,reduce overseas travel
1,3246,1127,3229,Isn&#039;t this fiddling around the edges - need more fundamental thinking here
1,3247,1120,2590,balanced performance data and conversations from those holding boroughs accountable - starting to happen (again) but still some way off
1,3248,1170,2880,best its  AB
1,3249,1133,3123,We need to move away from trnsactional Finance to transformational, but they need training and mgt.
1,3250,1155,3162,Should pay be locally debated
1,3251,1194,3211,if it was it might lead to greater incentivisation to undertake FI on all arrested
1,3252,1124,2297,far too many ACPO - each commanfder costs &pound;250k with all on-costs - give supts and senior staff proper responsibility
1,3253,1106,2296,Why do TFL have enough money to fund a 68 million pound policing unit.  Why was it not given directly to the MPA
1,3254,1138,3113,That is of course true but I guarantee 75% have been there for 3 months plus because no one has bothered to dispose of them
1,3255,1160,2298,Incentivise prudent budgetary control, allow more flexibility to those who do it well. Enable carry over of surpluses from one period to another. Make empowerment real.
1,3256,1132,2298,Be realistic about what our requirements are. We often define a Rolls Royce (in business process and infrastructure) but can now only afford Ford Focus. Unit coosts must be aligned to Actuall business need
1,3257,1126,2297,Put some budgetary constraints on the use of POLSA - no one seems to own them
1,3258,1151,2695,what consultation has benn undertaken with chief execs and where is their accountability in this strategy
1,3259,1159,3218,Seems to be ok at Colindale.
1,3260,1166,3092,my local authority were keen to invest millions in local policing but are frustrated at our inability to deliver on simple contracts and have now withdrawn, central beaurocracy has killed this enthusiasm.
1,3261,1194,3211,I was amazed to find that we get so little back from our investment. W
1,3262,1150,3204,Inevitably the Police Officers, but how many posts are held by  ACPO because they have pips on their shoulders and our partners believe it is only such who can represent the MET!
1,3263,1136,2297,actually devolve budgets at the moment its non-exsistent
1,3264,1156,3219,Changing staff from cops to police staff relies om finding the right people at the right time with the right skills-it is not realistic to identify these as savings before April 2006 -and where will the current incumbents go?
1,3265,1162,3173,Holding too many events off site in rented accommodation eg like today.
1,3266,1171,3173,How much do we spend P.A. on newspapers ?  How much is wasted on copies of the job which litter the canteens ?
1,3267,1125,3233,spot on, but stop changing the objectives time and time again in such work
1,3268,1192,3160,These opportunities need to be developed in tackling cross border issues. Many of our crime hotspots are cross border but there are very few cross border initiatives outside of enforcement.
1,3269,1188,3097,This highlights the need for greater awareness of LAAs with all the potential they have for affecting CDRP - and thereby policing related - funding.
1,3270,1104,3188,How come we are &pound;40 million short now - we were only &pound;26m short before the Deputy Commissioner&#039;s latest review of the savings
1,3271,1194,3261,was amazed to find that we get so little back from our investment. We doove 40% of the national total and get a very small proportion back
1,3272,1145,2298,Make budget holders build the budget from the fround up i.e. justify every &pound;. We reward overspending with bigger budgets!
1,3273,1148,2298,stop doing so many things at once.  this drives up mgt on costs
1,3274,1096,2299,Support collegues who are brave enough to challenge the cultural icons
1,3275,1188,2301,There are 3 words that would make a huge difference to the MPS. They are &#039;please&#039; and &#039;thank you&#039;. .....Easy isn&#039;t it.
1,3276,1145,2296,Need to go to zero based budgets, stop depts getting money based on past need.
1,3277,1119,2301,what happened to our values of openness, honesty and transparency? These are what the public are looking for
1,3278,1169,3217,it is 32 million not 2 billion we have to make our case to govt and the mpa the mpa i am sure will deliver this for us
1,3279,1162,2299,Reflect the values in everything we do both on and off duty.
1,3280,1123,2297,There seems to me to be a real tension in the proposals of service review which will significantly impact on budget.<br />On the one hand we are setting out a strategy to enshrine the locl borough (BOCU) as the unit of delivery. I suport this - why then are e removing all flexibility from them for hiringfiring staff and buying resources to deliver services. This will be the real impact of centralising support services under &quot;service centres&quot; andwill increase bureaucracy and on cost. If we really trust in devolution then lets prove it by giving out the power andcontrol for all aspects to BOCU.
1,3281,1156,3219,I havebeen asked to make savings locally and I am very happy to set about the task for the prupose of delivering Safer Neighbourhoods and other aspects of Service review.  However we still do not have a definite figure to work to.  I NEED to know the finalised figure as quickly as possible as there is great uncertainty within  my borough as to how we will meet this particular challenge.  The sooner I know the sooner I can strt a meaningful process that will allow proper consultation and time to recruit etc.
1,3282,1145,2299,Senior managers must learn to understand the effect of their actions especially when they conflict with their words - actions speak louder than words, or alternatively talk is cheap.
1,3283,1125,2300,stop doing so much management and admin and start acting as leaders
1,3284,1119,2301,Are we becoming too internally focused and inward looking? The values feel too internally focused...
1,3285,1161,2299,recognise those who exemplify them both formally and informally
1,3286,1110,2301,must remember that we are public servants. The public are often seen as an irritant. This must change first
1,3287,1096,2300,Resource the Together programme and recognise it as a very challenging programme to be managed
1,3288,1145,2300,All managers must have total integrity in staff reporting and must challenge staff when their behaviour and actions are inappropriate.
1,3289,1155,2299,Think before we act and treat others as we would want to be treated
1,3290,1132,2301,We need to stop offers of a &quot;rope and public hanging&quot; and P45s for some one round this table - both of which have come from membersof the management board.
1,3291,1114,3274,need to distinguish between icons which are obstructive and must go and those which contribute to excellence and must be celebrated
1,3292,1194,2299,What people feel about their work and what they think about the orhanisation will reflect in the way they deal with people in their day to day work - How we deal with each other and our staff can make a huge difference
1,3293,1095,2299,promote transformational leadership and end the blame culture
1,3294,1148,2301,Get back to London being policed by Londoners
1,3295,1096,2301,Use first names as a matter of course
1,3296,1145,2299,Agree what they mean and ensure everyone has the same meaning.
1,3297,1103,2300,start doing the type of management that most organisations do and we do not. See time spent talking with staff as time well invested not a cost. See staff development as good and stop constraining our prople by removing or stifling their initiative
1,3298,1161,2299,as leaders we can also challenge those who do not live them - support those who can change, remove from the organisation those who can&#039;t/won&#039;t
1,3299,1145,2299,We need more leaders not task orientated managers.
1,3300,1108,2301,Disabled staff do not feel valued and supported, they feel undermined and disadvantaged. Budgets come first adjustments second. do we really want to reflect who we police. the morris enquirey clearly flagged the largest percieved disadvantaged group was the disabled yet this is never spoken of.
1,3301,1095,2299,collaborative management as an essenial steptowards becoming a genuine learning organization
1,3302,1096,2301,Finally abandon the &quot;Band C Smith&quot; title in written work
1,3303,1172,3294,what does that mean - no immigrants or people from other parts of the UK
1,3304,1192,2301,We have to ensure that the frontline - those who have regular contact with the public - understand what it means to &#039;respect your customer&#039;. Recently there was an incident very near my flat, and the way I was treated - simply as a member of hte public - by the officer on the cordon made me incredibly angry. The only way I can explain her attitude is one of arrogance to me, a mere member of the public, who was daring to ask what had happened right outside my home. No answer of any kind was provided - I was essentially told to go away. all I had asked was &#039;what happened?&#039;<br />This is what we have to change to make citizen focus a reality
1,3305,1170,3294,Does that include management board
1,3306,1169,2299,are our people really that bad we must not make such sweeping generalisations of over 40000 people.
1,3307,1194,2299,Not keen on the first value &#039;Have pride&#039; - quality service - how is that going be defined or measured. Let&#039;s have something thats on the tin - Protect and serve there can be no greater priority
1,3308,1145,3285,And ensure that those who do not are not rewarded.
1,3309,1162,3286,the (poor) front office experience must not be underestimated.
1,3310,1148,3295,This smacks of tokenism, our staff want us to be leaders not mates.
1,3311,1096,3291,Interesting!
1,3312,1170,3294,There is only one member of management board who lives in London
1,3313,1161,3290,what does this mean?
1,3314,769,2301,Our poorest areas of performance on boroughs are accessibility at front counters and control rooms and response team stafing levels.
1,3315,1170,3312,sorry that should be one police officer
1,3316,1165,2301,Fair and right first time must be the basis from which we work
1,3317,1133,3310,If we use their first name they should use ours&#039;. It&#039;s called manners
1,3318,1168,2299,Beware the cynic and the loudtalker.  I do not see a force of supremicists.  I do see a pressurised service that is &quot;the front line&quot; facing disatisfaction from a public that is concerned about life in general.
1,3319,1148,3295,It&#039;s still a disciplined service and respect see Values) is an issue internally and externally
1,3320,1153,3303,This isn&#039;t about geography, all who police London make  a valid contribution as London attracts people from all over the globe.
1,3321,1145,3285,You need to explain why we need values i.e. value driven organisations outperform non-value orgs i.e. it is tangible and impacts the bottom line - otherwise why do it?
1,3322,1096,3306,The vast majority of our people are not bad, we just have to use them properly and value their skills - let Fido bark
1,3323,1157,3297,a very general statement.  Many of my friends work for other organisations and they say the same/  I think we are better than we give ourselves credit for.  A lot to do I grant you.
1,3324,1110,3309,is this an excuse?
1,3325,1140,2301,include and embrace those who are different or say things that are different in everything we do
1,3326,1148,3317,There is a time and place
1,3327,1140,2301,more listening than talking
1,3328,1103,3309,we all form first impressions. and if it is bad, it is almost impossible to recover. I like the right first time mantra. But not everyone in this room appears to understand it
1,3329,1118,3295,Modern day policing is a long way from Sirs and Maams and the modern day service needs to both recognise that and respond to.  It serves only to boost the egos of &quot;superior&quot; officers.  Respect is gained from effectiveness in role and not metal on shoulders.  It is time for change !
1,3330,1131,3294,Your arguement would be valid if London was populated solely  by Londoners. It isn&#039;t. It is what the person can deliver for Londoners and what they bring to the organisation. NOT where they happened to be from
1,3331,1145,3285,A radical overhaul of promotion and selection processes is required to ensure that those who progress are those who truly put the organisation first and are not merely self serving.
1,3332,1153,3327,Hear hear!
1,3333,1123,2298,Devolve cost centres - dont create service centres
1,3334,1096,2301,The hierarchy is a blockage to Team Met; we must move away from judgemens of worth based on seniority of rank/grade.
1,3335,1103,3327,....and doing the work
1,3336,1114,3312,perhaps you might reflect on the sacrifices that entails for them and their families.
1,3337,1133,3326,For both managers and staff. one rule for all
1,3338,1140,2301,look at this room - does it represent londons make up .. it is getting worst
1,3339,1145,3274,We need to create a climate where to challenge is not an act of bravery, but where challenge is welcomed.
1,3340,1133,3329,absolutely
1,3341,1129,2301,manage careerism (pesonal career agendas) that frequently undermine Team Met principles and values
1,3342,1156,3310,Smacks of common politeness , good manners and mutual respect-we should not need to be called Sir/Ma&#039;am to feel respected-much more honest to risk being called by your name and take respect when offered, not demand it in a title
1,3343,1160,3329,Agree - this makes a real difference to teamwork and effectiveness.
1,3344,1095,2300,understand the impact of the myths an legends we create and set the right example by acting with utmost integrity
1,3345,1131,3315,and isnt that mistake entirely symbolic of the second clss satus ofpolice staff!!!
1,3346,1119,3304,the trick is to mobilise discretionary effort in our staff-this is values based
1,3347,1132,3313,It means we are some times more oppressive than we need to be . When things do not deliver to plan on occassion very senior people have crossed the line about what we would expect in this new culture. To be threantened with a P45 in a public meeting is not the language we need.
1,3348,1140,3327,thats why god gave us one mouth and two ears
1,3349,1133,3338,not worse - not better quickly enough
1,3350,1118,3300,Disabled staff are well towards the bottom of the diversity hierarchy sadly and this seriously needs to be addressed.
1,3351,1153,3338,Its a start, we have a 170 years worth of errors and ommissions to improve up on.
1,3352,1194,3298,We should use the values to select and promote. They should be the core basis of measurment - PDRs etc.
1,3353,1188,3299,we need some task orientated managers if we are going to delivery well on the day to day!  This isn&#039;t incompatible with living the values  - we should not give ourselves the &#039;opt out&#039; of thinking we can&#039;t live the values and deliver.
1,3354,1103,2301,must always talk the game up. everyone else will knock us. Praise and gratitude are important so is talking with colleagues.
1,3355,1149,2301,stop promoting white middle aged men
1,3356,1096,3313,I think it means being offered packages as operational necessity - that&#039;s the excuse for not using a fair process
1,3357,1148,3329,call me old fashioned but the success of the mps is based on leadership, discipline (balanced) with professional standards! agree that egos of superiority are not right. but lets keep this in perspective
1,3358,1168,2299,Beware too many glib phrases
1,3359,1163,3295,lets get on and do it - then worry about the bigger issues
1,3360,1133,3341,why should snr officers all want to be on SMT. there should be recognition of work below that level or we will lose good people
1,3361,1194,3299,We need to take the time to lead. Communication is key aspect of leadership and we should pay more attention this area of leadership
1,3362,1103,3338,look at the numbers It is etting better but it is a slow rate of change
1,3363,1103,3360,agree
1,3364,1146,3334,Why are we separated by rank at these tables bar one table?
1,3365,1194,3299,I agree if we get the communication right we could move mountains
1,3366,1104,2300,feedback or blame? Positive or negative
1,3367,1140,3338,also ones who do the work quietly for others to take the glory and enhance their careers
1,3368,1145,2301,Operational focus; police officer V&#039;s police staff.
1,3369,1151,2299,By leaders / managers respecting their staff enough not to use patronising, cliche ridden pseudo management speak.
1,3370,1103,3355,i agree the setiment but at the end of it I got the job because i beat off others
1,3371,1150,2301,there are still many barriers to advancement and retention for our diverse workforce, these still exist today, we need firstly to understand and accept there are issues it is only then we can move forward
1,3372,1118,3338,At this time, Team Met does not adequately understand or respond to gay issues and I feel demotivated by the MPS and at this time do not feel wanted by Team Met.
1,3373,1156,3355,Develop all those with the skills/potential for the futUre- irresepctive of colour/gender/orientAtion
1,3374,1153,3370,Well Done.
1,3375,1133,3330,Londoners are people who live here and love here. not use it for career advancement and then get out
1,3376,1114,3355,that really is a dreadful comment: why not rephrase as promote on ability and on ability alone
1,3377,1120,3355,That smacks of a sexist racist assumption - would be tolerate sucha comment in reverse?
1,3378,1105,3355,We should be looking for the right person with the right skills to do the job, rather than diversity issues
1,3379,1125,3355,so where does this help if they are the right people for the job?
1,3380,1163,3290,theres a lot of picking on MB here - they want the MPS to succeed.  Lets all get on with it
1,3381,1118,3357,You are old fashioned !  Jump into this millenium.
1,3382,1159,3288,Iin fact all members of staff must challenge unethical behaviour. Unfortunately the culture still exists where staff are too frightened to do so for fear of reprisal or being victimised. I have experience of this personally and the managements willingness to turn a blind eye was nothing short of disgraceful.
1,3383,1166,3286,The &#039;moment of truth&#039;, ie the metaphorical handshake which constitutes first contact between the MPS and its customers, must be the focus. First impressions are lasting impressions!
1,3384,1163,3336,this is irelevant rubbish grow up
1,3385,769,3368,What does this mean? there are a large numbers of police staff who deliver a key operational role.
1,3386,1194,3327,Listen, hear then do something with the information and then let people know what we did with it and how they contributed to what&#039;s being done.
1,3387,1096,2301,Do we still need an officers&#039; mess?  Surely not.  All staff may have a need to entertain colleagues and partners - not just senior colleagues.  And it might save some money.  And the staff could be redirected to feeding service delivery colleagues
1,3388,1118,3357,Being old fashioned is one of the biggest problems for the Met, that needs addressing.  Can you please flush out these old fashioned non movers and get some real modern passion into key roles.
1,3389,1151,3369,At last, some honesty. Policing is essentially simple, let&#039;s not obscure that reality by complicating that simplicity with self serving management speak complexity. That is the real culture that needs changing.
1,3390,1103,3312,4 actually
1,3391,1152,2300,Deal with bullies
1,3392,1156,3355,How do we recognise and reward those who are willing to get on and do their job well instead of pursuing promotion .  I would suggest that at the moment we dont do it very well!
1,3393,1194,3368,May be it will be forever thus - police officers are from venus and police staff are from Mars or is it the other way around
1,3394,1145,2301,The organisation must seriously address the issue of bullying, this is normally perpertrated by people in positions of authority and is very hard to challenge.  The MPS must look long and hard at how to deal with this, it could be painful and mean asking really senior staff to examine their own behaviour.
1,3395,1159,3391,Many of whom seem to get promoted
1,3396,1172,2300,value and support inovation and diveristy of thouhgt
1,3397,1133,3342,well said
1,3398,1148,3323,we are ahead of many organisations...........stop beating ourselves up
1,3399,1152,3391,Past leadership set the scene that said bullying was OK!  Now it is different but we need to repair the MPS
1,3400,1163,3314,and this has been the case for years. Is the MPS ready to address this key public service issue - it must
1,3401,1157,3252,that  also applies to those below acpo as well--it  is easy to knock others
1,3402,1130,3395,Some got the very top job!
1,3403,1153,3367,This happens a lot.
1,3404,1155,3392,There must be an alternative to promote and move. Different kinds of reward.
1,3405,1112,3395,Does that then apply to everyone in the room?
1,3406,1168,2301,Response teams must be promoted from the basements of police stations away from the sewage outlets and the boiler rooms.  Maybe they would leave the police stations feeling valued.
1,3407,1162,3295,On the theme of a &#039;civilian&#039; police force, how about taking a bold step and abandon ranks but obviously retain appointment titles?
1,3408,1156,3387,Do you still have one?  W e don&#039;t on boro
1,3409,1145,2299,Values and behaviours must be part of the performance review and affect how you are rewarded. If you deliver but do not live the values this is not acceptable or excusable!
1,3410,1119,2300,Feedback - the 360 degree process is a salutory lesson for everyone, not just managers, I learnt by it and hopefully am better for it
1,3411,1108,3347,I totally agree you hear this in certain quarters and it goes against the ethos of TeamMet where we should all help others and where we have problems collectively work together to resolve issues - not use the sacking or transfer solution.
1,3412,1096,2299,Stop bullying and undermining each other.
1,3413,1103,3387,i agree
1,3414,1117,2299,believe many of us do, but those that don&#039;t are not challenged and are actually rewarded as they drive and bully people that achieves in the short term but can never do in the long term. Need to reward decent behaviour and good leadership
1,3415,1148,3391,need to define bullying it is probably a perception more than reality of leadership style
1,3416,1159,3309,You&#039;re assuming that the public can find a front office that is actually open when they need it!
1,3417,1132,2301,given the future we need to to able to take more well judged risks without &#039;risk&#039; of condemnation. This is a great enabler to understand what could work in a different way
1,3418,1096,3408,Two at NSY.
1,3419,1194,2300,Engage our people in the process of change. Communicate with them, listen to them, hear them and respond
1,3420,1140,2301,integrity has been ditched
1,3421,769,3355,Whilst people admire our operational effectiveness, is it any wonder that we are simultaneously a laughing stock?
1,3422,1161,3378,but how can our staff who are disavantaged by discrination ever be in a postition to play on an equal playing field, if we do not look at the diversity issues
1,3423,1149,3377,have a look around the room
1,3424,1145,2299,Please do not suggest 360 degree feedback - this organisation is not mature enough for real honest feedback. Telling your boss what you really think of them is not a position to go for straigh off.
1,3425,1152,3415,when our staff hate the idea of coming to work or working for a particular boss, that is bullying
1,3426,1160,2299,Very interested in not treating people differently because of rank or grade. Are we really ready for this?
1,3427,1153,3394,This won&#039;t ever be done as there are too many who cover up the casualties and damaged people, that get damaged when identifying this sort of behaviour by the organisation. They are the problem and the perpertator gets promoted.
1,3428,1136,2300,i would welcome more time to be visible and lead but the org drive and demand often prevenst this
1,3429,1103,3420,keep in perspective
1,3430,1095,3394,it undoubtedly would require some very senior officers to examine their own behaviour
1,3431,1138,3368,So when will the center stop pulling in the poor BCU commander when his/her crime rises and compliment them for how well their community supports them
1,3432,1096,3394,Working with staff support associations will help - it&#039;s one of the things they are there for
1,3433,1157,3375,tosh
1,3434,1133,3404,absolutely. need to have an organisation where getting more metal on shoulders is not a sole career goal.
1,3435,1128,3372,why what has made you feel like that is the staff association helping - opefning doors?
1,3436,1194,3297,Don&#039; be too quick to don the sack cloth. Many organisations would consider us to be good.
1,3437,1162,3387,Here is a golden opportunity to demonstrate that the MPS is a &#039;civilian&#039; police force as espoused in the Commissioner&#039;s speech.  Close the AC&#039;s Mess down.
1,3438,1150,3394,managers must also be empowered to ask difficult performance questions holding people to account without being labelled a bully
1,3439,1119,3391,there is a fine line between bullying and being held to account, each of us will have a different perception, BUT that should be considered by the manager on an individual basis
1,3440,1108,2301,We will not get colleagues to be honest and open if there is a threatening culture around failure. Failure is often a team issue rather than a single individual. Blaming and acting inappropriately against an apparent colleague who maynot be performing for some reason is not acting to our values.
1,3441,1133,3418,key to the executive washroom died a death in other sectors many years ago
1,3442,1148,3357,whats your definition of old fashioned
1,3443,1192,2301,Not exactly a symbol, but I think re-defining the role of Commander has a role to play here. Currently there is a lot of disillusionment and frustration within ACPO and with those who are not ACPO but work with them. In particular I see this with people newly promoted to ACPO. Much of this seems to be driven by the fact that many Commaner roles are poorly defined, do not have clear accountability  (operational or other) and often are not linked to goals relevant to running an organisation. This is driving an unhealthy competition between ACPO as they fight for a purpose, for job satisfaction etc. This in turn sets a poor example for those near them
1,3444,1157,3420,evidence please
1,3445,1145,2300,All managers must take greater responsibility for dealing with those members of staff who have no interest in contributing.  Greater use of inefficiency regs and lobbying needed to create Police Regulations which really enable staff to be dealt with effectively.  At present good staff can have no confidence that their inefficient colleagues are being dealt with.
1,3446,1117,3410,Need to incorporate this in appraisal system and objectives
1,3447,1096,3400,Some of us very experienced colleagues rememeber this being an issue in the Priority Programmes back in 1984.  Spooky!
1,3448,1131,3420,Whose? I have faith in the integrity of the vast majority of my colleagues. Have you ditched your integrity and if so why?
1,3449,1171,3400,When will those boroughs who are trying to tackle this problem, get some support and acknowledgement for improving front line delivery service ?  Or will I continue to get &#039;beaten up&#039; on performance figures ?
1,3450,1095,3339,the corporate stretegy of the mid 1990s was explicit in saying that middle managers must challenge the culture to find better and smarter ways of working - but there was great resistence to anyone who actually tries it - we need to grow up
1,3451,1096,3316,this needs to be rewarded/sanctioned apporpriately
1,3452,1140,3443,i agree ....
1,3453,1191,2299,Significantly improve and modernise the initial courses for Ps and Insp. Get in early and get it right.
1,3454,1132,3355,promotion or any posting should be on merit and available to all this comment is a sweeping generalisation and shameful
1,3455,1151,3355,Even on the occasions when  they do the job best?
1,3456,1133,3423,this room is a result of recruitment from 20 years ago not today&#039;s
1,3457,1119,3424,as a boss, it was a salutory experience, not to abuse the respondees but to change myself!
1,3458,1145,2300,Make sure that HQs are not staffed by people who have lost touch (or never had) any understanding of what occurs at the &quot;sharp end&quot;.  Policies and strategies must have genuine input from those people who live in the real world.
1,3459,1161,3438,I doubt there is anyone in this room who could not distinguish between bullying behaviour and management action.  Let&#039;s start by not announcing role changes in open meetings involving those affected.
1,3460,1194,2299,Ive seen that one work both ways it&#039;s not just the preserve of police officers
1,3461,1120,3423,I challenge the statement itself, as a &#039;minority&#039; member of the room. If you said &#039;stop promoting women&#039; would that be acceptable language? I would expect it ri to be challenged and rightly so. Sauce for the goose etc
1,3462,1136,2295,whilst i have a plan to communicate this to my colleaguse but  i don&#039;t have the means to- simple things like the cash to hire a room big enough to get the whole boro in one place -this doesn&#039;t exist locally. some cash to implement locally pls
1,3463,1153,3438,I agree.
1,3464,1171,3430,As a senior woman officer now with the MPS for the fourth decade, I can tell you I did not encounter any sexism or bullying until I reached Supt. ranks.  It&#039;s still there !
1,3465,769,3286,How do we take the optimism, commitment and desire to serve that is so apparent on day one at Hendon, and convert this into negativity, cynicism and a sense of contempt for the public and colleagues?
1,3466,1117,3410,can we continue with things and build on it, for example cultural audits in the past have then been ignored rathr than used as baseline for future. need to stop wasting peoples time and energy otherwise will see everything as short term
1,3467,1145,2300,Make sure that all staff are given and understand personal development as opposed to promotion.
1,3468,1118,3357,Some stuck in the past and not positively embracing the community that you are now apparently serving
1,3469,1128,3355,stop knocking them as well - they are part of the community and a lot of them are working hard to engage and we need them as well - there are still a lot of cultural barriers within minority groups which stops them considering the police as a career. I am white female with a son and this attitude makes me sad because he has lot of diverse friends but this attitude will not help him his friends integrate.
1,3470,1140,3435,watch in this era of inclusiveness it happening to other areas
1,3471,1133,3433,as opposed to your view?
1,3472,1194,3420,We shouldn&#039;t need to state this, it&#039;s there it exists.
1,3473,1145,2299,What are you going to do with those who don&#039;t live them?
1,3474,1096,3275,This is a real quick win.
1,3475,1098,3387,We still have an AC&#039;s  mess and a senior officer canteen at NSY. They are mainly used by MB, however the senior officer canteen is more acessible to senior staff members. I think it is a disgrace and should be available to all.
1,3476,1095,2294,remember what the police demography was like 25 to 30 years ago - actually we have done rather well to allow a disproportionately large number of women and veisible minorityofficers to progress, given how few are in the relevant service bands
1,3477,1171,3363,Without whom we would achieve NOTHING
1,3478,1126,2299,stop dealing in sound bites - judge people on what they are not on what others say or on short exposure to them.
1,3479,1145,2300,This is huge cultural change management programme. We need skilled change managers to drive this through the organisation - do we have them?
1,3480,1103,3424,I am happy as a member of man board to do this. I have little doubt that my colleagues would also
1,3481,1163,2301,well done Bill on the &#039;troops&#039; point - about time I hate it.
1,3482,1094,2301,Under representation across the specialisms and in middle &amp; senior management must have special attention to bring a different perspective of policing. Our rituals prevent or disrupt the motivation of BME staff who wish to positvely contribute to the modernisation process
1,3483,1145,3457,That requires alot of trust and I&#039;m pleased your learnt from it but others will use it as a stick to beat people!
1,3484,1117,3458,Can we ensure a clearing house for all policy as each individual policy has impact on other policies so add them together and can&#039;t achieve them. prioritise policy and then we will deliver it some policies actually contradict others.
1,3485,1108,2301,Thanks Bill!!
1,3486,1148,2301,We are obsessed with this bit fill in some of the others
1,3487,1104,3481,i&#039;ll pass it on to the troops
1,3488,1096,3481,and &#039;cops&#039; while we&#039;re at it.
1,3489,1140,2301,was bill selected through formal process
1,3490,1162,2301,Reinforcing the need to get away from the military model - it is a block and quite frankly doesnt reflect today&#039;s military culture anyway - it is still based on the &#039;between the wars&#039; military culture when Commissioners were all ex miltary.
1,3491,1123,2301,understand what cultural changes take place in our constables after the first introduction to the public that leads them to want to get out of 247 policing within 6 months.
1,3492,1133,2301,Small thing but please can we just have one lanyard which says MPS and not which business group you belong to. Eg SO13&#039;s lanyards are bigger than anyone elses? Why - it&#039;s not for operational reasons, surely!!
1,3493,1128,3394,there is no normality in bullying this is a poor attitude and values nothing to do with rank band or grade they should not be in the organisation
1,3494,1096,3481,And sporting ones - on the right foot
1,3495,1113,2299,language in the met is changing, remember that all of us here have contributed to some big changes in how wespeak to and about each other. More change will come, but don&#039;t make it artificial and forced
1,3496,1117,3419,totally agree
1,3497,1155,3295,Lets not forget Ailsa when we talk about MB
1,3498,1119,3424,Bill-your great. That was inspirational
1,3499,1093,2300,If I can cal you Bill can we now accept that we should drop the title detective?!!!
1,3500,1096,3494,Sorry - on the front foot.
1,3501,1148,3485,He is still my hero, make him an AC!
1,3502,1117,3445,totally agree but more effective rewards for good staff
1,3503,1140,3481,call police a social service
1,3504,1096,3492,Another quick win.  We&#039;re all Team Met
1,3505,1150,2301,learn the lessons from &#039;Animal Farm&#039;
1,3506,1118,3355,I agree in promoting the right person for the job, but how can the MPS be unrepresentative of the community that we serve - It cannot be so !  If positive actions needs to be taken, then lets do it and support people.  However lets not just leave that with women and ethnic minorities and extend it to minorities such as faith, LGBT, disabled, etc.  At the moment, the MPS are giving priority to certain minority groups and this must stop.  The MPA are perpetuating this and this is completely unacceptable.
1,3507,1166,2299,the values must become the currency of the service ie the means by which our people inter react on a day by day basis.
1,3508,1148,3485,but he is still a sir
1,3509,1131,3481,MPA has been banging on about lexicon issues for years - and  IBs point about officers being civilians. I suppose the moral is that change in these practices has to come from within.
1,3510,1116,2301,Don&#039;t get hung up on language before addressing the very powerful message about values, otherwise we are in danger of accusations of superficiality.
1,3511,1096,3485,No Bill - we police staff need you
1,3512,1159,3394,Perhaps the MB could push government to include Police within the protected employees who are catered for within the &quot;Whistleblowers Act&quot; . At present the MPS states that it will follow the spirit of the act and support all staff who blow the whistle. This is a miff, I am a living example who was made ill by the lack of support I received, in fact I was moved stations, put into a role I didn&#039;t want to be in and the isolated. It then became apparent that I had been forgotten about and it was until I approached an AC that I was actually allowed to get back to doing the police work that I actually joined the Job to do.
1,3513,1160,2299,It is essential that we develop tools which enable us to evaluate how cultural changes are/are not taking place.
1,3514,1145,2299,Visibility, accessability, approachability - terms that are used to describe safer neighbourhoods. They are equally relevant to how MPS leaders should relate to their teams.
1,3515,1163,2299,There is a real and significant amount of energy that needs to be put into this combined with commiting time to those you lead
1,3516,1117,3458,need to rotate people around organisation-more movement between centre and borough and specialisms. redistribute staff and skills
1,3517,1119,3498,Bring back John Grieve - a team with Bill, both of whom have given me such support/advice where others had criticised. We should have learnt from the few
1,3518,1131,3475,Yes!
1,3519,1152,2301,interesting irony......the response to july bombings was predicated uopn the humanist team without rank or grade etc yet still we remain this military based structure that responds to shoulder badges
1,3520,1145,3275,And a basic courtesy - how have we forgotten it?
1,3521,1163,2298,The culture around overtime needs to be dismantled
1,3522,1169,3391,we must not confuse holding to account with bullying we have a responsibility to deliver and to be held accountable
1,3523,1146,3510,Laanquage is everything! We must be hung up on it!!!
1,3524,1191,3424,An excellent presentation which was a sincere and persuasive argument for chnage driven by leadership and respevct at all levels.
1,3525,1106,3495,We are changing and the evolutionary process has started.  The trick is to speed it up rather than drive it. Otherwise it will be regarded as PC rather than ideological change
1,3526,1126,2301,be careful of changing some of the symbols thathave stood the test of time - they serve a purpose
1,3527,1135,3003,a corporate package for the delivery of the values message do not leave to individual senior management interpretation
1,3528,1146,3523,and spelling
1,3529,1163,2299,Top down please!
1,3530,1133,2299,Why can&#039;t we have joint promotion processes for police officers and police staff which test generic skills?
1,3531,1173,3285,not enough of this - inconsistency means that some will be recognised and many not - loss of morale and desire to change
1,3532,1095,2299,there are now hundreds of responses on here - from the top leaders in the organizationa - and a depressingly large number of them appear to be negative or narrow, reactionary and defensive, or pursuit of personal agendas - how are these people going to find the professionalism to join in the progressive journey that lies before us?
1,3533,1157,3424,i completely disagrre with you - as a much criticised memeber of acpo - i can only start to do my bit if people are honest enough to tell me what i need to do
1,3534,1156,2300,Need to rationalise the amount of information circulated to all for digestion we have to take risks to weed out what doesn&#039;t get read-acknowlede that more time in front of computers is less time leading our staff and challenging poor behaviour/changing the culture-we are slaves to te e-mail!
1,3535,1117,2301,stop running down what we have achieved so far! Last year the theme was &quot;building on success&quot;
1,3536,1106,3498,absolutely agree
1,3537,1115,3289,I think you should treat others as &quot;they&quot; would want to be treated, not as &quot;we&quot; would want them to be treated
1,3538,1145,3286,Without them there is no police service
1,3539,1191,3498,Bill for AC!
1,3540,1146,3526,baby and bath water!!
1,3541,769,3408,Something for the troops to aspire to
1,3542,1150,3310,all managers should read &#039;Who moved my cheese&#039;
1,3543,1093,3458,bring back tenure - there was nothing wrong with it
1,3544,1152,3338,it is changing the stars are women officers and staff. anon male
1,3545,1153,3443,We promote and then decide what roles they peform (often ones thta could be carried out by police staff)
1,3546,1096,3533,Giving feedback isn&#039;t the same as 360 degree reporting
1,3547,1117,2590,Stop using theterm performance was a derogitory expression.! Once we develop the quality agenda we will need performance indicators.
1,3548,1106,3424,It is unhelpful to me that I presently can&#039;t get 360 feedback including partners&#039; perspective
1,3549,1125,2299,do unto others as you would have them do unto you
1,3550,1153,3491,Not just the public, wait till they meet thier collegues
1,3551,1106,2299,change our performance measures to make values and public service more central
1,3552,1171,2301,Please don&#039;t forget how much good change we introduced post Lawrence.  We must not forget our &#039;corporate memory&#039; and learn some of the often difficult lessons we learnt in 1999.
1,3553,1117,2590,Dont forget we have a huge legacy of knowldege around QOS and customer focus from a few years ago (contact the former QPP unit)
1,3554,1195,2300,What gets measured get done seems to have been the anthem of the mps for the past 28 yrs of my service. Unfortunately they are all short term. If we are going to break the cycle, we need to ensure that we have s/m/l term targets that are multi-agency and for London. Control Srategies need to be developed for London, not just &#039;police&#039;.
1,3555,1119,3485,Bill your points are clear - change the internal culture and our externalculture will change
1,3556,1127,2301,Look at the rank structure (police and police staff) and consider how we hang notions of status, power and influence on it.  Look at roles within every policing function and work out how to flatten the structure and build in more respect and our values (and rewards?) around skills and roles.
1,3557,1148,2301,stop all this being self absorbed, and do some &#039;doing&#039;
1,3558,1148,2300,embrace the problems and constructively support solutions. add some value to achieving the task. &#039;high level&#039; help should do just that -  help, NOT hinder
1,3559,1151,2300,My son is a PC and listening to him, his views on supervisors, the short cuts / antics some officers get up to and the total lack of any strategic thinking at this level is frightening. If we are going to bring our staff with us we must accept  these views are there and deal with them at the ground floor level. Put a group of PC&#039;s in a room like this with this technology and see what you get to understand the problem that we have to address with our staff.
1,3560,1106,3288,our systems discourage challenge - they too easily turn the spotlight onto the manager trying to improve things
1,3561,1151,3304,did you challenge this behaviour?<br />We all have a responsibility to address poor performance
1,3562,1106,3391,the hard bit is distinguishing between bullying and the appropriate challenge of staff who then resent management action
1,3563,1095,2725,so what did? disrespect and discourtesy? i don&#039;t think so
1,3564,1151,2729,Look at the overtime at Air Port security and Manpad cover. Speak to the PC&#039;s doing this work and find out where money is being wasred.
1,3565,1159,3530,Good idea - this could at least encompass the skills around values.
1,3566,1104,3415,Here is an example : The OCU commander walks into the busy CID office and shouts out, at the top of his voice,  &quot; (officers surname) you havn&#039;t been in the charge room with a prisoner all week, is it&#039;s because you think it is a battlefield and being a typical Italian coward you&#039;re too scared to go in it. &quot;  This goes unchallnged by any witness as they are all scared of the OCU commander. The victim complains and is then branded a liar despite having witnesses who are prepared to support him. Now that&#039;s bullying and a true story. By the way, those involved know who they are and no doubt will be reading this today.
1,3567,1106,3314,but achieving better service at Met front counters will not win re-election but if we were to reduce crime and increase sanctioned detections ........
1,3568,1095,2531,the principle comes from a piece of research from the criminological researcher Marion Fitzgerald - one of her practice papers during the Policing London research - and it is worth considering her quote in full:<br />&quot;It may be unrealistic to expect patrol officers:<br />- to exercise authority appropriately, with fairness and consideration for the feelings of others;<br />- to approach people with respect, regardless of their status;<br />- not to prejudge situations, but to listen;<br />- to see things from others&#039; points of view<br />if they themselves are not treated accoding to those principles. We need to think throuh the long term consequences if they continue to take the frustration that (double standard) can generate both into their personal lives (by which she is referring to the high levels of domestic violence amongst police officers that we do not like to think too much about) and out into the streets.
1,3569,1095,2687,i agree
1,3570,1106,3338,should I feel guilty for being a hetrosexual, white, male?

1,3892,1153,3879,Investigate problems that upset staff
1,3893,1153,3890,how will you manage feedback
1,3894,1202,3591,Post inspection
1,3895,1152,3883,is ten days feasible for a corporate package?
1,3896,1153,3890,will  you set a standard?
1,3897,1152,3895,If it&#039;s important enough the organisation should do it.
1,3898,1149,3598,POST REVIEW
1,3899,1191,3884,Q -how are you going to share the information with staff?
1,3900,1094,3581,post inspection
1,3901,1152,3895,you need to address some difficult issues then the organisation should give people the tools to deliver it
1,3902,1191,3884,Q - how will you ensure what has touched and inspired you today will inspire someone on late turn at borough?
1,3903,1153,3879,Is this just about values?
1,3904,1191,3902,A - personal commitment needed from everyone here today
1,3905,1094,3900,why do you think it will take 10 months to get to that stage given SR have put their strategy together.  In response, finance, and we do not want to repeat mistakes, we want to think it through thoroughly rather than rush out and put together.  if you keep having to change what you go public with you dilute the message
1,3906,1152,3883,How do you measure how this is getting through to staff?
1,3907,1153,3879,how different will you look in 10 months time?
1,3908,1126,3882,Concern that by defining objectives at 10 months you&#039;re not going to empower individuals
1,3909,1191,3884,Q - How will you get sign up and ownership?
1,3910,1116,3881,value champions.how would you choose them in an inclusive way.<br />A: from across themet. those who have interst and skills. self identification. people who know anout these issues. Can cove issues of inclusivity. Cascading has natural blockages. Key people who can make a difference at al levels are needed.
1,3911,1094,3900,There has to be achievability in what needs to be done.  Learn from outside orgs, they say very little about it unitl they are ready to go live with it.  We are not so good at that.  This is a 3 year programme.
1,3912,1095,3576,Results of the discussion
1,3913,1152,3906,get a group of people around you that you trust and who understand the message and they will get the feedback to give to you. we can also do online surveys to see how well the messages have been received
1,3914,1191,3909,A - would need an implementation plan with clear milestones.  Timing is suitable now to do this as we all in planning stage of year, can build this in now
1,3915,1126,3908,Concern that you&#039;ll be spending too much time defining timescales etc and telling people what to do
1,3916,1128,3887,What different roles are the individuals going to play
1,3917,1126,3908,are the key messages being developed corporately or locally?
1,3918,1094,3900,What will you do with non-compliance with regard to communicaiton strategy.  Has to feature in PDR, sanction and reward process, which is why a lot of behaviour and values cannot be changed overnight.  Need to incorporate into selection, DPA and HR.  When moving and selecting people into and across the org, should use values to select
1,3919,1116,3881,Why only bill?<br />why not others?<br />bill underpinned everything across the strategy.<br />others may receive it differently<br />Its got to be put out quickly ad impactively. it is based on the views of all
1,3920,1153,3892,We have heard there are problems but have had no feedback as to what the specific problems are.
1,3921,1128,3916,Roles to be defined as part of the strategy - will depend on the OCU and the SMT
1,3922,1147,3588,Inspection
1,3923,1142,3886,what about the PSA targets - how are you going to influence them
1,3924,1126,3917,today hasn&#039;t given us the key messages - is it finance or safer neighbourhoods for example?
1,3925,1095,3912,How get across to late turn van driver?<br />Very difficult messge, is there anything now, maybe later
1,3926,1142,3886,How will people be held to account
1,3927,1126,3917,preference would be to have corporate key messages
1,3928,1147,3922,What are you going to tell local people?
1,3929,1191,3909,A - in order to make this different from previous changes/schemes, need to give staff something immediately, that has instant impact, gives you something to hang the other messages on
1,3930,1128,3916,Overall responsibility at OCU cdr, head of business group etc
1,3931,1151,3880,THere is no mention of training
1,3932,1126,3882,do you not think it&#039;s necessary to discuss with staff why there is a need for change
1,3933,1116,3881,the change agents can work with bills messages.<br />The tie that binds was together. had the most resonance. we have to get to grips with this message if we are t deliver
1,3934,1142,3926,Through the PDR process
1,3935,1126,3932,was it not done under Service Review?
1,3936,1205,3733,Post inspection review
1,3937,1126,3935,could it be tested locally?
1,3938,1128,3916,Important to identify local levers for change - be clear about their role
1,3939,1142,3934,Would you sack  people for poor performance
1,3940,1152,3883,big question. are the values we identified five years ago for new recruits the same as we need now for delivering safer neighbourhoods. we need a mechanism to reward and sanction positive behaviours. PDR is that mechanism but some work needs to be done to identify the correct behaviours.
1,3941,1151,3880,Re looking at policy, use policy as guidance
1,3942,1205,3574,Post inspection review
1,3943,1126,3908,Been clear so that it does happen
1,3944,1094,3900,Have you considered a programme board at the 10 week stage to balance out the silo working?  Those involved in the programme board will take more than 10 weeks to get together.  The PBoard will sit above those setting objectives to hold people to account.<br />Who will set up the Prog Board - Deputy will be senior responsible owner.  The programme board will look at what can be done within budget.  Budget and elements of SR can be included in this board, what for SR can be done now and what in next three years and what are the critical pathways.
1,3945,1128,3887,This is a model / framework that can be used at any level in the organisation
1,3946,1126,3882,what is the marketing/communication strategy?
1,3947,1205,3942,What is significantly going to change, when we have been through this before on a number of occasions
1,3948,1116,3881,difficulties in knitting together service review and together?<br />some we have to get on with. It HOW we do these things. \\yes we will have to move to service centres but its how we treat our people whilst doing so
1,3949,1152,3940,or should the organisation simply be underpinned by these values so that it just becomes the way we do things
1,3950,1205,3942,How will this succeed when other attempts at change have failed
1,3951,1142,3939,Will need people to succeed on things other than just the volume crime targets - qualitative improvements in service delivery shouyld be rewarded
1,3952,1151,3880,RIPA, CHIS, how will these be affected by these issues / values
1,3953,1126,3946,It will be delivered right from the start<br />But need clarity from the centre first
1,3954,1205,3947,This time we are culturally different
1,3955,1193,3575,what do you mean by moe sensitive information?  --&gt; enables you to pinpoint exactly where problems are.  individuals&#039; displays of behaviour
1,3956,1126,3953,It will include Staff Associations, Unions etc
1,3957,1205,3947,We have moved on as an organisation
1,3958,1151,3880,Pull apart the process and look at the implimentation
1,3959,1191,3884,Q - if you were asked to pick out the nugget in all of this, what bit of the strategy would that be?
1,3960,1193,3575,POST-REVIEW COMMENTS
1,3961,1128,3945,Experience suggests very important to have a clear framework where the roles of individuals in the change programme are clearly defined
1,3962,1126,3882,Why should the community engage with us?
1,3963,1205,3947,The focus is on deliverables and capitalising on the momentum
1,3964,1116,3881,The values are the messages that lead into conversation re corporate stratgy and service review (e.g by MB PERSONALLY)
1,3965,1142,3926,Back to point about Commissioner holding MB tgo account for quality of service provided
1,3966,1151,3880,Representative group from the OCU to see how this is to be implimented.
1,3967,1094,3900,cont from last comment.  Can look at Overtime and FR now.<br />A scenario - the Commissioner is keen to progress, can we afford 10 months before the programme board is running.  If we set up in an adhoc pattern it would not be so effective.  Can set up programme board early but they need some time to work in  a systematic manner.
1,3968,1116,3881,Vlues are the glue that binds allof the pieces this morning
1,3969,1152,3883,although it&#039;s not captured in the strategy, we need to conduct a skills gap analysis to see whether people are in the right place and have the right skills
1,3970,1191,3959,A - name change, how we address others
1,3971,1095,3912,Can you deliver these clearly defined strands?<br />deliver a consistent message, not a different message. Not necessarily only by champion. You can give a message in the way you behave. Champion can challenge where message not being delivered. Deliver in a way that helps people undertsand how they fit. &#039;segmenting&#039; gives feel of different messages, &#039;relevant&#039; is better.
1,3972,1126,3962,The partnership approach on Borough has told us they want to
1,3973,1205,3947,We have learned as an organisation
1,3974,1152,3590,Post discussion
1,3975,1193,3960,How can you communicate with staff when you don&#039;t know exacly waht is happening?<br />Corporate Strat is start point as is most ready document.  Start with the high level objectives for the organisation.
1,3976,1205,3947,What will get the message across?
1,3977,1151,3880,What external links will there be
1,3978,1128,3887,Overoptimistic about what can be achieved in the first 10 days
1,3979,1141,3885,Innovation in communicating, to make the strategy fresh is welcome
1,3980,1147,3928,Use internet, CPCG, &amp; variety of other methods.  Write column in local newspaper.<br />What about partners?<br />We need to do the internal stuff first to ensure we can deliver best service to public.<br />At boro level this is more about how we do things, not what we do.  We will continue to deliver to the public to same standards.
1,3981,1126,3882,Where is the prioritisation coming from?
1,3982,1126,3981,It needs to come from the centre
1,3983,1205,3976,A clear, innovative communication strategy at a number of levels, reaching out to everyone in the organisation
1,3984,1094,3900,How will you ensure local level delivery for consistency of message.  The monitoring and evaluaiton of the message will be important.  E.g. getting the communicaiton package right and getting commitment from all here to ensure the message was received and well understood, and to find out what was done with the message.  Should communication be a part of the inpsection process.
1,3985,1205,3947,What are the key messages we are going to deliver
1,3986,1151,3880,Not all of the strategy is of interest / use to all business groups.   It should all be focussed to the group
1,3987,1126,3882,We do need to do more on values and standards
1,3988,1152,3974,There is a real thirst for knowledge now as a result of the questionnaires that have been completed etc. so now people need to know what is the result if all this consultation.
1,3989,1193,3960,How can you communicate about the uncertainty of jobs etc in the future if you still do&#039;t know what the changes will be?<br />Cmsr said that there should be no reducndancies.  Staff are valued comodities in a growing organisation and there is scope for staff to be retrained and use their skills in other parts of the organisation.
1,3990,1128,3978,Will vary depending on the size of the unit - in some locations will be achieved - in others can only start the process
1,3991,1205,3985,There are going to be key changes
1,3992,1205,3985,We will be open and honest
1,3993,1126,3962,We are hoping to get more from the community
1,3994,1152,3974,ask you teams for help in delivering this final model
1,3995,1153,3892,Will you have specific measureable goals ? How will you know if you have been sucessfull?
1,3996,1205,3947,Who is going to take the output from today forward and turn it around in ten days
1,3997,1151,3880,Diversity, is there a need for regulation / deregulation.   Is the right person doing the job
1,3998,1142,3923,Need a national recognition that crime reduction targets are not the be all and end all
1,3999,1128,3978,Important to start the process in the first 10 days
1,4000,1205,3947,We need to make the uncertainty certain
1,4001,1191,3909,A - needs personal resp, if this doesn&#039;t happen, we&#039;ve all failed
1,4002,1094,3900,What role will statutory bodies play?  They will demand progress reports etc.  The programme manager should have an MPA member on the programme board.  We have to get out of the silo working. The leadership academy will start the foundation for this new way of working.  It will also feature in the budget process in feeding back to the authority.
1,4003,1116,3881,what about other training?<br />Training is sporadic. We need it generic and centrally. QA process are needed locally. it related to how we value our staff. Centralised approacjh wold ensure same message. Transformational influences need to be brought together structurally. THey need to sing together
1,4004,1141,3885,Need to communicate on wider basis with other agencies
1,4005,1205,3947,Be clear about what we dont know, what we can answer and what we cannot answer
1,4006,1191,3884,Q - HOW will you make people live the values?
1,4007,1193,3960,There will have to be reducndancies becuase of the specialist neature of some posts.  How do you deliver hte SR message and drip-feed it to give coleagues enough reassurance as we don&#039;t have all the answers?<br />Transparency.  People need to know where we are at the moment.  There are a lot of unanswered questions in SR.  We are failing to inspire staff to try something new in their lives.
1,4008,1126,3962,Need to look at the customer satisfaction: satisfaction with the police goes down after contact with them.<br />Need to think about who the customer is.<br />Who is going to mesure this satisfaction?
1,4009,1152,3974,we need to start the process now as the changes will be catastrophic. hopefully the results of those changes will be incredible too.
1,4010,1205,3947,What tangibles can we show to demonstrate change and progress
1,4011,1141,3885,Infrastructure changes will take longer than 10 months
1,4012,1193,3960,Need to think more laterally
1,4013,1116,3881,How are you going to get the balance between central message and local environment and the cultural differences
1,4014,1144,3777,How will you manage uncertainty? Everyone has their say - moving out of comfort zones - read opportunity not uncertainty - identify vulnerable staff/roles -ability for staff to raise issues without fear -bringing staff on board with changes -reaching the hard to reach staff - benefits/gains to staff - C3i model success/failures - lessons learned - threat is that some staff will vote with their feet - painful proces - reskilling staff opportunities for development - keen dialogue with line managers - best fitted staff will get the opportunities - danger is that good staff will explore opportunities outside MPS - effort in keeping best people - some will not want to be re-skilled - handling resistance to change
1,4015,1128,3887,Too long before engaging citizens
1,4016,1205,4010,Give out the key messages
1,4017,1153,3892,Can you deliver on performance and values?
1,4018,1204,3894,Strategy
1,4019,1191,4006,A - build it into PDR procesess, set actions...
1,4020,1205,4005,Be honest with our staff
1,4021,1191,3884,Q - how will you measure the success of the change in values?
1,4022,1142,3923,There are broader roles, eg intelligence, orcommunity engagement that cant be measured in the same way as burglary reduction
1,4023,1151,3880,Corporate image.   Image given by first contact - words used, way of introduction (not PC SMITH, but John Smith from the Met Police)   Professional image
1,4024,1128,4015,Recognised - importance of ensuring that fully understood within the organisation
1,4025,1126,3882,What about Staff associations, Federation?
1,4026,1116,3881,Thsi is why the idea of an academy is so goo. Passing thru an academy and giving that corporate message back into the work place is important  (How about a VALUES ACADEMY)
1,4027,1193,3960,We do have to be honest but avoid scaremongering.  From what you are sugeesting, the emphasis is very heavily on Corp Strat;  perhaps there should be more of an emphasis on SR as there will be many questions about it.  How much information should we give?<br />You ought to be able to give as much  as you can as far as you go.  But at the end of the day, they don&#039;t know! THere are less answered questions than unanswered ones.
1,4028,1151,3880,Do you need warranted powers to do that / this role
1,4029,1193,3960,But when will we be in a position to know?<br />As it happens!  But we need to be able to dismantle it and communicate as we go
1,4030,1191,4021,A - ask the same question at the start and then again after set period, eg how do you feel about..., compare responses, possibly do focus groups with staff and external stakeholders.  We are talking about major culture change, takes time for this to take place
1,4031,1128,4015,Focus on ensuring that changes will achieve the outcomes
1,4032,1116,3881,Where is performance measurement in this
1,4033,1205,3947,There is an enthusiasm for change
1,4034,1116,3881,maybe a customer survey / a citizen focussed based performance indicator
1,4035,1205,3947,There is going to be a change in focus and we will work in a different way
1,4036,1095,3912,examples of behaviour? how would it work - needs to be made explicit what cutlture change requires.<br />are behaviours up for negotiation? for managers to address if get resistance, any scope for discussion? Together should lead.<br />Care not to rush in to this, until some more info from together.<br />listen to the rationale of people who question this - we may not be right. e.g. the term troops may be considered worthy by staff so should not be changed - be clever about what changes not didactic.
1,4037,1142,3934,staff are not interested in those roles which maximise the overtime, they would prefer ones that allow them to have a satisfactory work/life balance
1,4038,1128,3887,How to integrate this into the planning process for 06 - 07?
1,4039,1205,3947,Don&#039;t be cynical.  See the changes as a positive and rally people to get involved in the changes and welcome them
1,4040,1151,3880,Clarify things such as &quot;not to meet the public &quot; for sick / disabled officers / staff ... does this mean not able to interact, of simply not able to go on a raid
1,4041,1148,3679,Yes but in Bombay
1,4042,1191,3884,Comment - need to add the practical examples that you speak about to make this happen
1,4043,1149,3898,good point is to take time to understand the messages yourself  before communicating to others.  Strong centre will need to monitor performance against strategy.  Barriers identified but not enablers.  Main enabler is the communication itself.<br />How do you get the PCs and ground level staff to buy in?  Staff associations and unions, living the values and direct honesty.
1,4044,1144,3777,What would success look like or you and how would it look for you? Only once criteria had been established - constant evaluation of success - timescales for success - another set of measures around organisational change -  balanced scorecard - not too much impact on core business - identifying risks - ccontrol strategies
1,4045,1191,3884,A - need to look at who does what...
1,4046,1147,3922,How do we get to determine the quality of service?<br />Staff survey.  Important that we baseline current level of service quality and regularly measure the improving qulaity.<br />Should it be external as well as internal?<br />Should be external as well as internal and need to ensure consistent improvement on both sides.
1,4047,1205,3942,What are the quick wins
1,4048,1128,4038,Need to ensure that two activities are linked and integrated - clear accountability

1,4248,1193,4145,There is a recognition that we do some things very well, but our routine encounters are not well received.
1,4249,1106,4145,The Strategy and Service Review are opportuntities for Londoners and the MPS, especially staff for the future.
1,4250,1149,4145,In order to move forward the mps must treat us all with respect and we must respect each other so you tell me what you think?
1,4251,1116,4145,Adapt or die (or have a non-living experience).

1,4253,1147,4145,The attitude of staff is far more professional than it has ever been
1,4254,1095,4234,We have desire to enable them to be as successful in future
1,4255,1201,4145,The citizen focus of this strategy has to be real to make it work, and the way we live our values is crucial to delivering it successfully

1,4262,1125,4145,The train is about to leave the station, if you fancy the journey get on board, if not..................
1,4263,1104,4145,This is not an option we must move forward.<br />This is an opportunity for the MPS to be at the forefront of police reform in the 21 century.<br />This strategy will improve life for everybody in the MPS.
1,4264,1112,4252,And encounters between Met staff matter too, live the values internally as well as externally
1,4265,1128,4145,opportunities for the organisation - redundancy
1,4266,1160,4145,Time for change<br />Reasons to be positive about the future:<br />SNTs<br />Teamwork after July events<br />Olympics<br />Why we need to change:<br />Six key strategies<br />Many opportunities to be grabbed
1,4267,1153,4145,we have to accept that the transition period will be difficult and there will be uncertainty along the way.
1,4268,1195,4145,What we need to be saying is what all this means for people individually: what it means for them, the timescales involved, any personal impact (financial or otherwise) on them -  but we are not yet equipped to do this
1,4269,1202,4145,The succes of Team Met - building on the past [such as response to 7/7] and ackknowledging the need to change.
1,4270,1148,4145,facing a new normality
1,4271,1152,4145,Clarity will come, but we always be evolving as an organisation.
1,4272,1133,4145,first impressions matter
1,4273,1206,4145,Change involves:Corporate strategy; together and values; service review and budget changes
1,4274,1201,4145,how can we get you (the staff) involved so you feel part of the process and support the values of the organisation. not because you have to but because you want to
1,4275,1144,4145,Service review will necessitate change and will present opportunities for everyone
1,4276,1095,4145,An honest statement about job prospects
1,4277,1094,4145,call me bill
1,4278,1147,4145,Every contact with the public (as well as our contact with our staff) is what counts
1,4279,1132,4262,who&#039;s driving it
1,4280,769,4145,Paint the picture - achievement, major incident/event response, resilience and a thank you. Then the opportunity, the imperative to do even better - citizen focussed, quality service, responsive, open and engaged
1,4281,1112,4145,Team Met is a really simple way to explain it all
1,4282,1148,4145,if it&#039;s an issue for you, it&#039;s an issue for us
1,4283,1197,4145,The ideas have been developed in consutation and colaboration across the organisation - everyone has a voice use it
1,4284,1160,4145,Our new values
1,4285,1111,4251,Is there not a better choice of words to use ?
1,4286,1202,4145,We are seeking a greater level of satisfaction in the service we provide. Which will improve community safety.
1,4287,1095,4145,This is about chnaging the way people interact within and outside the organisation
1,4288,1216,4223,Mr Mannering
1,4289,1195,4145,That the MPS will be an even better place to work
1,4290,1200,4145,Be honest, say it as it is. Promise to keep them informed and part of the process.
1,4291,1132,4277,But my names Tony
1,4292,1201,4166,No we can&#039;t because not everyone will sign up to and live the values or be sufficientlhy customer focused - do we want them in the MPS?
1,4293,1128,4157,who are you? give me your contact details
1,4294,1092,4145,Enthusiasm
1,4295,1191,4145,We need to apply the same standard of excellence to daily interactions with our customers as we achieve in critical incidents
1,4296,1197,4145,People will need to have be flexible - that way there will be room for everyone in the organisation
1,4297,1136,4145,Translating the strategy into what it means for people&#039;s role
1,4298,1147,4145,You don&#039;t get a second chance to make a first impression (PLUS programme circa 1988)
1,4299,1173,4145,This is not about cuts but there will be realignment.
1,4300,1197,4277,Hi Bill
1,4301,1118,4145,Support visible/front line/customer facing/operational service deliver.  Put the money and resources where it matters to the customer.
1,4302,1141,4172,Do you mean the Sub Standard?<br />not fit to wrap chips in!!!!
1,4303,1129,4145,There are changes coming to support the Corp. Strategy<br />The changes will or may affect you as they are a re-direction or alignment of resources rather than a cost cutting exercise<br />The details is not clear yet so wait for more thorough briefing and informaton.<br />Team ethos is pivotal to success of the changes, known as &quot;Together&quot; and you are part of Team Met.
1,4304,1119,4145,Whilst achieving our performance targets we need to increase public satisfaction in all areas
1,4305,1200,4145,This time it&#039;ll happen
1,4306,1195,4145,we need to know the plan first, then we can deliver the key messages. Do not have enough clarity yet
1,4307,1160,4145,Some of these changes will have a significant impact on some individuals. They will be treated well, in accordance with our values.
1,4308,1206,4145,Why we are doing this;the key outcome
1,4309,1197,4277,Howya doing Bill
1,4310,1125,4262,There is a lot of difference between refocus and cut
1,4311,1131,4167,Who is they? WE mean it
1,4312,1197,4277,I&#039;m fine Bill
1,4313,1108,4202,The Met needs to reform, its all about &#039;citzen focus&#039;  being at  the heart of our business and delivery our services to all
1,4314,1173,4145,We will keep everyone up to date on progress
1,4315,1160,4145,Not change for change&#039;s sake
1,4316,1148,4145,we are first and foremost law enforcers not social workers
1,4317,1197,4277,they named a programme after me
1,4318,1115,4262,And which direction are we going in?
1,4319,1093,4172,or the Mail
1,4320,1216,4277,How much do i owe you Bill?
1,4321,1197,4277,Operation Bill has now commenced
1,4322,1191,4145,Change will affect you in the following way.....
1,4323,1094,4187,do we have a common understanding of consultation?
1,4324,1160,4145,Exciting
1,4325,1191,4145,We are changing because.....
1,4326,1108,4202,We are capable of dealing with any major incident that effects London
1,4327,1181,4279,YOU ARE
1,4328,1104,4305,where?
1,4329,1148,4145,if it&#039;s an issue for the community it is an issue for us
1,4330,1118,4172,Will be difficult to make the change
1,4331,1111,4314,How ?
1,4332,1125,4149,we need some to get the show on the road, the odd planner
1,4333,1195,4262,Hopefully we can deliver this message in a more positive manner
1,4334,1129,4277,can I call you old bill? (58)
1,4335,1095,4145,WE don&#039;t know the full extent of chnage yet, but this is going to happen.
1,4336,1132,4277,Who are you
1,4337,1147,4145,Don&#039;t read the Mail!
1,4338,1191,4145,You can contribute to change by.......
1,4339,1173,4223,This is not only about MPS staff but the people of London and the service we provide
1,4340,1197,4277,Protect and Serve there can be no greater priority
1,4341,1130,4305,Thats what they said last time!
1,4342,1160,4252,The world is watching us
1,4343,1190,4262,and can police staff have free travel?
1,4344,1142,4262,we really need to be clear about the re-focussing and cuts issue.  A lot of comments are not seeing the bigger picture.  This is about changing the way we work.
1,4345,1133,4311,The SMT - we need them to mean it if we are o deliver
1,4346,1118,4145,The change process will be difficult.  Not all staff will embrace it and we need to ensure as many staff as possible are ready for change,
1,4347,1197,4145,Protect and serve there can be no greater priority
1,4348,769,4262,next stop Hogwarts
1,4349,1149,4145,we value you, so if you are moved we will fully re-imburse your additional expenses
1,4350,1093,4172,Stephen Rimmer is coming
1,4351,1112,4149,Start the change today - don&#039;t wait
1,4352,1172,4316,but we are agents of social change
1,4353,1164,4146,have a clear plan and stick to it
1,4354,1125,4305,we have to do something, we cannot do nothing, remember something is better than nothing when it delivers what is required when it is required
1,4355,1106,4251,Some of these comments reflect a lack of respect  for the values out lined today.
1,4356,1110,4145,Its not just change - its improvement.  It will bring opportunities.  There&#039;s a bright future for those who are ready to take the opportunities
1,4357,1094,4223,choose your exit strategy
1,4358,1216,4285,Dont the Daleks use this in their induction meetings?
1,4359,1118,4145,Listen to staff as well as talking to them - communication is a two way process.
1,4360,1197,4146,Don&#039;t change direction half way through after I have delivered the message
1,4361,1153,4145,The biggest obsacle for change is the dickensian police regulations that require updating.
1,4362,1204,4145,The background - changing face of London and society; Olympics etc
1,4363,1136,4145,We consider our staff to be our greatest asset - the changes that take place will not happen without negotiation. Service Review will open up opportunities
1,4364,1108,4146,Take note of your own strategy and lead my example
1,4365,1104,4353,then change it
1,4366,1113,4146,clear and simple messages
1,4367,1155,4146,Act as a team
1,4368,1193,4146,don;t let the agenda slip
1,4369,1147,4145,The Times is off message
1,4370,1149,4146,listen to their staff and address their concerns
1,4371,1148,4146,clarify what the messages are - be concise
1,4372,1206,4146,Remove uncertainty
1,4373,1197,4146,Be patient change on this scale takes time
1,4374,1119,4146,Allocate an equal proportion of their time and set milestones
1,4375,1173,4146,Their actions must support their words
1,4376,1160,4146,Pull together, maintain a united front even in private
1,4377,769,4316,Should we also be social engineers?
1,4378,1206,4146,Walk the talk
1,4379,1202,4299,If you are being realigned this will still feel like cuts
1,4380,1190,4146,clarity of message
1,4381,1216,4360,Or even two weeks into it.
1,4382,1125,4146,stay on messqage, stay together and support your direct reports
1,4383,1193,4146,don&#039;t hide the bad news
1,4384,1200,4145,This is not just more the same. This time it&#039;ll be different. We can&#039;t ignore the realities. Change has to occur for your good, the good of the organisation and for London.
1,4385,1096,4146,Stop operating in silos
1,4386,1205,4146,show us the business case!
1,4387,1135,4146,do not have simplistic means of measurement
1,4388,1188,4146,stop the turf wars
1,4389,1197,4146,Prioritise which bits we can do
1,4390,1199,4146,Display the values that we are asking our staff to display.  Leaders make culture
1,4391,1092,4146,give us some quick wins to show our people change is tangible
1,4392,1119,4146,Lead by example
1,4393,1111,4146,Simplify the message, let everyone understand what it is that we are doing and then deliver ..stick to the plan and hold your nerve !
1,4394,1096,4146,Don&#039;t multi task
1,4395,1095,4146,Need realistic resourcing of the change plan, or change the plan
1,4396,1096,4146,Work together
1,4397,1193,4146,laugh sometimes
1,4398,1154,4353,360 degree feedback
1,4399,1146,4146,Don&#039;t move me half way through this process!
1,4400,1149,4146,before reaching conclusions think dont just go for the cheapest option
1,4401,1116,4146,Demonstrate how you live by the values
1,4402,1095,4146,MOre realistic targets
1,4403,1108,4146,MB should tells us quickly the key message we can then use
1,4404,1190,4146,get out of your silos
1,4405,1157,4146,please practise what you are asking us to preach
1,4406,1113,4146,be open and transparent - don&#039;t let rumours circulate and obscure the message
1,4407,1152,4146,Please, please, please give us a simple and clear message
1,4408,1096,4146,Use your first names, not ranks
1,4409,1206,4146,Act as a visible team
1,4410,1133,4146,Work as a team
1,4411,1193,4394,please please don&#039;t multi task
1,4412,1172,4146,The moving finger writes and having writ moves on.  Nor all your piety nor wit can lure it back half a line nor all your tears wash out a word of it.
1,4413,1135,4146,how long will street crime drive management agendas
1,4414,1096,4146,Stop protecting your empires
1,4415,1195,4146,Make it clear that TeamMet comes before individual mgt board agendas. Need to know that you respect one another first
1,4416,1173,4146,Provide information about service centres and realignment as soon as possible to reduce uncertainty
1,4417,1199,4146,Dont be diverted by external politics
1,4418,1092,4146,Be aware of the risks to the achievement of this strategy and manage them
1,4419,1096,4146,Egos are a thing of the past
1,4420,1163,4146,Is Team Met exclusionary and gimmicky - (developed by a PR company) will staff by in? Does it incorporate partners?  Does it relect our new values?
1,4421,1205,4386,yes we need rationale to sell
1,4422,1116,4146,Show us you really are &#039;Team Met&#039;
1,4423,1206,4146,Give clarity re what business groups will do
1,4424,1197,4146,Help us to make this happen - be enablers
1,4425,1132,4146,Stay in post and deliver your plans
1,4426,1125,4372,but not by making us do thinks like a prescription
1,4427,1142,4316,we are a Policing organisation.  This is about more than law enforcement, despite the recent central government focus on &#039;crime statistics&#039;.
1,4428,1204,4146,By creating a clear, simple, affordable  and achievable plan and sticking to it.
1,4429,1096,4146,Work with staff associations at a strategic level
1,4430,1201,4350,what does that mean
1,4431,1096,4146,ACs are assistants to the Commissioner
1,4432,1095,4146,protect us from political buffeting
1,4433,1104,4383,not everthing requires a positive spin - accept the situation..then ask what can we / you do about it?
1,4434,1093,4146,Check your messages are being passed further down through the command chain - ask how often do you meet and tell your people what is happening!!
1,4435,1197,4146,Clarify which bits are budget cuts and which parts are Service Review
1,4436,1129,4394,Limit the spin
1,4437,1132,4419,Oh no theyr&#039;e not
1,4438,1126,4146,trust us to deliver
1,4439,1153,4146,The commissioner needs support from the ground up by all staff. DPA are not doing enough to change his profile from a perceived politically driven person to one who has the interests of the officer on the beat at heart.
1,4440,1144,4146,Hear the bad news as well as the good
1,4441,1163,4146,Should the new strategy be branded? ie Plus, London Beat?  Together is good, but it is only one of the 7 priorities.
1,4442,1135,4146,demonstrate the need to flattern management cost at the top
1,4443,1193,4394,recognise day to day operational delivery is still important - don&#039;t become a corporate strategy junkie
1,4444,1119,4146,Be prepared for a drop in performance as a consequence of change and support the longer term vision
1,4445,1216,4146,Influence Home Office / Govt thinking re PI delivery over time
1,4446,1150,4146,there needs to bemore clarity of key messages, regarding the direction, roles of MB, eg Steven Rimmer&#039;s role
1,4447,1197,4146,Keep to the key messages don&#039;t change them
1,4448,1104,4381,or three weeks
1,4449,1113,4146,split the messages - service review, budget, corporate strategy and workforce modernisation and together are all big subjects
1,4450,1164,4146,help prevent other organisations changing or deflecting our progress e.g. MPA, GLA, Govt
1,4451,1096,4146,Communicate to your staff everything they need to know about what goes on at Mgt Board rather than your own interests
1,4452,1201,4146,remove the managers that do not want to change
1,4453,1105,4146,when refreshing the strategy don&#039;t make any fundamental changes to the direction
1,4454,1160,4394,Don&#039;t have HR service centres and take all my brilliant staff away.
1,4455,1191,4146,The message earlier was that there is a widening mission and yet if we do not give some priority to parts of the Corporate Strategy we are in danger of becoming avearge across the board?
1,4456,1115,4412,Somebody needs to get out of the office more !!
1,4457,1120,4353,provide a bit more flexibility about safer neighbourhood team deployments/restrictions etc
1,4458,1206,4146,Be highly visible
1,4459,1130,4146,Personal agendas have been mentioned earlier - if they exist (be honest!) - mitigate them in order that corporacy genuinly comes to the fore.
1,4460,1195,4360,Think and deliver strategically
1,4461,1125,4146,when you delegate don&#039;t interfere, remember the law of subsidiarity and don&#039;t take away peoples responsibilities that are rightfully theirs
1,4462,1204,4419,Display cost morality in all that you do.
1,4463,1096,4146,Let us help you - we have strategic management skills
1,4464,1163,4146,Will MB demonstrate the together philosophy in a different way of doing business
1,4465,1206,4146,Make the difficult decisions
1,4466,1147,4146,Give us a model for what the call centre looks like to &#039;sell&#039; to our staff who feel threatened by not knowing
1,4467,1095,4146,Not taking constructive dissent in the wrong way
1,4468,1146,4456,No, they need to stay in more!
1,4469,1149,4146,dont see the Trade Unions as obstacles to change but as Partners
1,4470,1205,4394,just do it
1,4471,1200,4146,Let us know in clear tangible terms what you think this&#039;ll look like so that we can translate that into deliverables at the coal face.
1,4472,1172,4456,filistine
1,4473,1096,4146,Have a proper plan for communicating to everyone
1,4474,1164,4394,have the same rules for all staff at all grades and ranks
1,4475,1095,4146,MB need to be prepred to say what the priorities are at any one time
1,4476,1125,4146,keep out of the binking weeds, you pay other, probably more able people, to do that
1,4477,1096,4146,Get out of your offices
1,4478,1193,4389,explain why we cant do the bits we can&#039;t do
1,4479,1115,4419,Egos are alive and well - I say so, and I&#039;m the one who matters !!
1,4480,1195,4360,Establish a mature and strategic approach to how we relate to Whitehall departments - we can  help influence the national (or even London) agenda more that we do now
1,4481,1197,4419,Team met must come before personal ambition
1,4482,1190,4449,yeah
1,4483,1150,4146,There must be clarity about who on Management Board i s leading on what: Stephen Rimmer; Bill and Paul Stephens
1,4484,1216,4444,Citizen focus is not compatible with performance obsession because obsession means exclusion to all others
1,4485,1096,4146,Walking the talk
1,4486,1111,4419,influence a change in necessary legislation to make police officers employees, so that we could start doing things differently and for the better
1,4487,1104,4419,empower your sergeants they communicate with your constables and will make or break your strategy - hold the accountable
1,4488,1160,4146,No mixed messages
1,4489,1153,4394,Publicise the good things more robustly so that the public can see that we are proud of our day to day achievement and they can then measure this.
1,4490,1193,4392,and try not to do everything
1,4491,1172,4413,so long as HMG wish it
1,4492,1200,4372,Consistency - in for the long haul
1,4493,1216,4431,can u explain
1,4494,1108,4394,stand up against inpracticle and immorral policy direction from MPA and the Home Office
1,4495,1154,4450,Don&#039;t bite the hands that feed you
1,4496,1197,4146,Make the values core to everythig that we do. Hire, fire and judge on that basis
1,4497,1132,4146,Trust senior managers to deliver
1,4498,1093,4146,I wish management board could do this to us!!!
1,4499,1095,4146,Encourage a joint approach to problem solving
1,4500,1163,4146,ensure that all decisions are anchored in the strategy
1,4501,1115,4472,Someone needs to get a dictionary !!
1,4502,1205,4146,Do you want devolvement or centralisation - just be honest.
1,4503,1096,4146,This is not a good question.  It should be collective responsibility
1,4504,1117,4444,agreed
1,4505,1155,4466,It would be good to see where it has worked to be able to point to success
1,4506,1125,4485,stop talking the walk and then sending others
1,4507,1153,4472,can&#039;t spell
1,4508,1104,4444,empower your sergeants they communicate with the PC&#039;s they will make or break this for you
1,4509,1204,4146,Be bold
1,4510,1110,4146,What do you want us to be? World leaders? What can we afford to be? We need investment in priority areas.
1,4511,1195,4146,Say positive things about one another. I often hear from Whitehall colleagues that no MPS officer ever says anything positive about another officer. Management Board has to lead the way in changing this perception (or is it reality?)
1,4512,1193,4419,igloos are a thing of the past
1,4513,1147,4146,Time is now to flesh things out better. You are telling us again what you told us 2 weeks ago.
1,4514,1202,4146,If it&#039;s not working or it goes off course, come and talk to us about why it isn&#039;t working and then LISTEN
1,4515,1163,4146,dont be too down about all this trivia
1,4516,1160,4146,Don&#039;t bully, be forgiving, things won&#039;t be right first every time
1,4517,1120,4146,let the DACs take on more of the control of the running of the organisation - MB to be less hands - on (not written by a DAC)
1,4518,1172,4501,we are being ironic and postmodern
1,4519,1157,4146,try to accept that when people present you with alternative views of seeing things that they are trying to help you and are not saying that you are wrong - i would expect my own people to debate things and at the end agree that we have a common objective - it is the same for all of us
1,4520,1131,4146,show some maturity. Please?
1,4521,1106,4353,The first port of call will be cultural change.  Well meaning individuals could do a lot of harm to the corporate message.  In our experience there are few people in the organisation that have delivered a cultural change programme of this magnitude.  We need a plan and guidance and soon
1,4522,1104,4146,empower your sergeants they communicate with the PC&#039;s they will make or break this for you
1,4523,1125,4502,you can have both if the responsibilities are defined, and then stuck to
1,4524,1119,4146,I am really concerned around the number of priorities, some hard decisions need t be made so we can deliver the necessary changes - it&#039;s about time we focused on a qualitative service, an outcome in it&#039;s own right
1,4525,1200,4372,Recognition of good practice/achievement in this area needs to be high within the communications strategy. Let&#039;s trumpet our success.
1,4526,1201,4146,cut the distinction between service review, MTFP, etc clear messages
1,4527,1147,4146,What do MB think OCU Commanders are doing to drive the messages forward?
1,4528,1150,4146,there needs to be a full risk review of this major organisational change with nominated managers responsible for show stopper risks
1,4529,1128,4146,strict governance around the service centre delivery - if it is not managed properly managed then the bocu commander will fill the service gap with a police oficer
1,4530,1112,4450,Let&#039;s have constructive partnerships
1,4531,1163,4386,we must maintain the external focus during this internal change period - it is the public we ultimately serve
1,4532,1152,4449,Create some more ranks
1,4533,1199,4452,We despartaely need the tools to put the right people in the right place and work out a way of parting company with those who continue to display bad attitude!
1,4534,1195,4146,Be aware the impact that throw-away lines can have (eg the earlier comment re Tim godwin - &quot;the best Deputy we never had&quot;). What does this tell us?
1,4535,1117,4444,an we have results of this
1,4536,1125,4517,oh dear another &#039;Officer&#039; centric comment, what about the senior police staff.
1,4537,1112,4431,i.e. to work with/assist him rather than anything else....
1,4538,1131,4450,You are accounable to those who are democraticallly elected and you are paid from the public purse, What arrogance!
1,4539,1195,4413,We can shape the HMG agenda more than we do now, and we have to!
1,4540,1141,4404,Do n&#039;t cattle eat out of silo&#039;s before going nto nslaughter  Only kidding I think!
1,4541,1125,4515,so you&#039;re not on board? why not make a positive comment
1,4542,1142,4526,These are different, SR is about redirection and smarter working - MTFP is about reducing the budget overspend.<br />But these things will all need to come together.  It is unhelpful if one is played off or blamed on the other.
1,4543,1125,4509,Charles Handy, the best management consultant in the world, said good organisations are always ready to forgive and give their people a chance to make a difference
1,4544,1199,4146,corporate publications NOW with examples of acceptable and un acceptable behaviours for the new Statemnent of Values
1,4545,1148,4485,communities defeat terrorism
1,4546,1201,4450,sorry its all our process we work together to ensure the best possible service and the mps could not have achived all they have without the mpa/gol/gla. It took the MPA to sort out our finances and ensure that we do not go over budget.
1,4547,1201,4450,clearly you cant want to work in a partnership and have no place here
1,4548,1119,4544,code of conduct - measured on all our pdrs
1,4549,1153,4544,Focus on Hendon and start with the instructors
1,4550,1151,4549,where is the mps i relation to the national programme for the modernisation of initial training
1,4551,1153,4146,Jonathan, you need to do this with all rank and file officers, staff, Traffic wardens, PCSO&#039;s etc.That way they can all be part of the consultation process and you will have a true picture to then take change forward.<br />This is a very effective method of seeking the views of the staff, do it as an interactive front page over two days, well publicised so that staff will make a point of contributing.  Its not all about MB.
1,4552,1153,4146,10,000 volts is a fantastic way to obtain an end product from all the staff f the MPS. You may be surprised. There are risks associated with this however, the benefits are measurable.
1,4553,1119,4393,There is every danger that the MPS will be defined by the events of July. Can we reflect on Stephen Rimmers comments about the excellance he has seen in every area of the MPS
1,4554,1119,4382,can we disengage from intimate socials with the media-they are poisonous and damaging our credibility
1,4555,1093,4145,YOUR JOB IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE KEEPING THE PUBLIC SAFE AND ARRESTING CRIMINALS
1,4556,1153,4429,Staff associations should be seen as partners within the MPS. they should be afforded similar budgets to other partnerships

1,4571,1187,4570,Its about belief
1,4572,1187,4563,What about the reality of the change?
1,4573,1187,4572,We need more detailed research and consultation into how things will work
1,4574,1187,4572,Need to assess the impact of all changes on each other so we have a full clear picture
1,4575,1187,4567,Be quick to capture the best staff and get them enthused about the possiblities

1,4765,1222,4580,stress<br />long hours<br />constant changing priorities
1,4766,1242,4739,public lack of confidence in the police ability to investigate major crime i.e. Stephen Lawrence
1,4767,1267,4580,Lack of training
1,4768,1245,4644,including direction of staff on completion of poliy entries
1,4769,1262,4580,unable to both manage and investigate
1,4770,1251,4580,lack of knowledge and procedures<br />allowing self and others to work long hours/ health and safety<br />lack of staff support<br />accountability for self and others
1,4771,1250,4580,lack of understanding of role in relation to that of SIO
1,4772,1258,4739,actions of partner agencies
1,4773,1245,4646,what does that mean
1,4774,1267,4580,Demand exceeding ability to deliver
1,4775,1266,4579,Work life balance for self and staff<br />Maintaining professional investigative practice in the face of overwhelmimg demand.<br />Stress Management<br />Mission creep - ie no longer the D/Sgt.
1,4776,1258,4739,New home office guidance
1,4777,1247,4682,Allowing probationers to become detectives
1,4778,1241,4579,SMT placing officers into crime group as a &#039;punishment&#039; posting.
1,4779,1240,4772,which agencies and how can their impact be managed
1,4780,1259,4657,hear hear
1,4781,1253,4657,Absolutely right - detectives at the top end built by career path, but more important is the confidence borne of experience
1,4782,1260,4670,The buck stops with you and when complaints decend there is no consideration to your workload at the time of the mistake
1,4783,1258,4739,media
1,4784,1257,4579,driving an enq to a conclusion before the next major incident deflects attention and resources elsewhere
1,4785,1265,4579,how to handle the media
1,4786,1243,4739,Pressure to steer investigation in certain directing due to media coverage from SMT members
1,4787,1254,4578,Policy decisions and how to best summarise these as opposed to &#039;how to write a policy book&#039;.
1,4788,1249,4636,this is a big problem, more and more di&#039;s are being appointed with little or no cid experience, also when very young in service. this is affecting the quality of investigations and also the training of cid officers who are supervised sometimes poorly by di&#039;s without the relevant experience
1,4789,1265,4580,media spotlight
1,4790,1247,4647,An enquiring mind
1,4791,1256,4739,Too many competing agendas
1,4792,1241,4739,too much new legislation/guidance to keep up with - makes individuals and organisation vulnerable
1,4793,1222,4739,in high profile cases interfence from politicians<br />extractions for world wide disasters
1,4794,1253,4689,Should DIs worry about budgets ?
1,4795,1243,4580,Expectations to be available even if only on thened of the phone 24/7 all year round regardless of leave etc
1,4796,1246,4579,be aware of restraints with finances.<br />ensure that officers do not overload.<br />be aware of employment law concerning civilian staff when restructuring within a working enviornment.
1,4797,1256,4739,Exposure, vulnerability, challenge.
1,4798,1242,4651,abolish level transfer in order to ensure quality and detective experience
1,4799,1260,4636,In our force the carreer detective is almost a dirty word and something to be discouraged therefore you struggle to get that level of experience
1,4800,1261,4579,constant change<br />reduction of importance of role opposed to community Policing including finance<br />call outs and being on the spot<br />budgets<br />demotivation of staff due to Spp etc<br />regionalisation<br />managing personnel<br />performance culture
1,4801,1245,4579,cid role wihin major incidents - lack of thought/concern from Gold Commanders to resulting long term investigation
1,4802,1262,4657,is that experience as an investigator or a manager
1,4803,1243,4758,17 weeks actually!
1,4804,1254,4578,Movement through the rank/departmental structure so that there is clear role understanding as there is progression.
1,4805,1247,4578,Sufficient time in uniform to understand the basics of the job
1,4806,1251,4579,lack of staff, resources and ot budget<br />achieving targets without sufficient resouces<br />working with safer neighbourhoods nwho have different targets and a full compliment of staff<br />training all staff to keep up to date with current legislation
1,4807,1253,4689,We have number crunchers for that surely - awareness fine, responsibility no
1,4808,1258,4779,Social services, health, education etc. Managing can be done through national guidance/legislation, protocols, early meetings, general close working relations, planning
1,4809,1256,4739,Challenges to personal confidence
1,4810,1252,4739,Obsession of Govt. / Chief officers with league and performance tables
1,4811,1223,4739,pressure to deal with the latest &quot;hot issue&quot; but ignoring that the previous one may require long term investigation
1,4812,1248,4739,High expectations which are almost impossible to meet with the volume of work and resources available.
1,4813,1254,4739,Public perception and media hype
1,4814,1262,4805,what about career pathways
1,4815,1245,4641,no longer able  entrust DS / DC that a task will be completed effectively, a need to check everything
1,4816,1258,4772,Rain
1,4817,1259,4777,Experience? Would a Probationer have the skills/experience/confidence?
1,4818,1244,4691,How do other Forces operate &#039; on call&#039; in view of the recent home office directive?
1,4819,1266,4580,Lack of support from inexperienced managers.<br />Over exposure in areas of professional weakness<br />Misconduct/Criminal Investigations as a result of professional mistakes.<br />Failure to meet performance targets due to demand of major crime investigation responsibility.
1,4820,1243,4657,Being a thorough detective doesn&#039;t necessarily transform into an effective DI as many examples have proved
1,4821,1262,4578,delivering strategy through effective tactics
1,4822,1258,4739,snow
1,4823,1254,4580,Lack of knowledge of best practice.
1,4824,1253,4662,Others should set agendas - we should be about professional delivery underneath those agendas
1,4825,1248,4739,Performance culture takes emphasis away from quality investigations onto the amount completed.
1,4826,1242,4777,Met CID office - 90% of staff with under two years service - probationers coming off street duties and going straight into the office due to lack of staff. Becoming a DC with three years service!!!!!
1,4827,1258,4739,sun
1,4828,1249,4810,permorfance is measured on figures. competency in role, leadership skills, experience, service to victims and witnesses are not measured.
1,4829,1259,4777,At what stage of the probation period would it be acceptable?
1,4830,1258,4739,wind
1,4831,1267,4739,Lack of knowledge and understanding of requirements and intricacies of role by others leading to unrealistic expectations and misinterpretation of actions
1,4832,1247,4739,The massive impact of the ever changing work environment, what seems to be a culture of &quot;keep shaking it until they don&#039;t know where they are&quot;by the government
1,4833,1268,4739,government driven performance culture-adopted by forces with unrealistic expectations-no challenge by ACPO
1,4834,1262,4739,public expectation
1,4835,1261,4739,expected to work in partnership now
1,4836,1254,4580,Exposure to expectations of &#039;all hours worked&#039; for comparatively little reward.
1,4837,1257,4754,I agree for the first time in my service CID is no longer considerd to be an attractive proposition for probationers
1,4838,1250,4580,lack of appreciation by ACPO that proactive experience is quite different to reactive experience and that the latter is more relevant to an SIO
1,4839,1258,4739,price of beer
1,4840,1262,4739,partnership and funding
1,4841,1259,4579,Getting Trainee Investigators through the National Investigators Examination
1,4842,1247,4762,If only that were true...
1,4843,1261,4739,often seeking finance from outside the organisation
1,4844,1243,4739,Continously changing targets
1,4845,1262,4739,public support
1,4846,1253,4818,Going to conciliation at PNB - more Forces beginning to pay `on call&#039; - recent ET result shows it cannot be dictated and is purely voluntary
1,4847,1256,4739,The expectation of the media and therefore the public is impossible to satisfy
1,4848,1264,4810,Yes but it feeds down to us all office to office,shift to shift and it is not all bad if it challenges areas of less performance or exports good ideas.
1,4849,1266,4579,Promoting the CID as a rewarding future.
1,4850,1245,4739,move towards sanctioned detections / nwnj etc
1,4851,1262,4739,changing policing landscape
1,4852,1242,4818,Met Pol Homicide - 9 teams for east london - each team does a week &#039;on-call&#039; i.e. 10-6pm core shifts then on a pager out of hours. Typical example - 10-6pm then 11pm call-out working until 11am the following day before handing murder over to &#039;in frame team&#039;
1,4853,1259,4578,Operationally competent level 2 investigator and be able to evidence this
1,4854,1251,4739,police targets and community targets are often different with variance of objectives<br />iag members<br />partnership variance re police action
1,4855,1268,4739,everything...EVERYTHING is a priority
1,4856,1261,4739,think media to please bosses and justify money
1,4857,1248,4739,Investigations can vary enormously in the amount of time needed to resolve them. This makes defining successful performance criteria almost meaningless, but the pressure remains upon DI&#039;s to reach ill defined targets.
1,4858,1223,4709,why does a DI need to know about firearms ops?
1,4859,1254,4580,Poor knowledge by senior management of the demanding role when performance management still needs to be maintained.
1,4860,1253,4694,Organisation needs to manage - but the individual is also responsible and sometimes needs help from themselves
1,4861,1260,4695,Training in your role is very important given the responsibility and your right the issues around complaints. we deal with serious crime therefore when the complaints come they tend to be serious.  My force currently do not offer training in the DI&#039;s role
1,4862,1246,4767,distance learning.
1,4863,1248,4762,You must be working in a vacuum then!
1,4864,1247,4739,The government policy of &quot;modernisation&quot; aka do it on the cheap is building massive problems now and for the future of the service
1,4865,1250,4728,Any decision making and the knowlede of the impact it can cause
1,4866,1263,4739,can effect overall moral if negative comments are made by person who know nothing about an investigation
1,4867,1256,4580,Retention in post
1,4868,1262,4828,&quot;quality assurance commitments&quot;
1,4869,1253,4714,like you can lead a horse to water - you can read the book or manual but it does not help you `walk the walk&#039;
1,4870,1254,4579,Circus management-plate spinning, and the lions den when it goes the proverbial &#039;up&#039;
1,4871,1251,4579,trying to achieve detections and also crime reduction
1,4872,1250,4579,Ability to delegate, take a step back and trust the team to do it
1,4873,1242,4858,You are the ACPO Silver commander
1,4874,1245,4580,no mentor / knowledge based review from senior management within division on your ability, performance
1,4875,1246,4657,do your apprenticeship within a divisional enviornment
1,4876,1243,4580,Lack of firearms operations experience
1,4877,1254,4739,Prioritise the priority-don&#039;t you understand?
1,4878,1253,4762,Professionals do not allow negative impact
1,4879,1248,4840,Wasting time engaging with partners for a political sop.
1,4880,1259,4799,Entreched attitudes that promotion must be achieved through uniform postings does not help - if industry were run in the same way, businesses would go bust!!!!!
1,4881,1247,4829,It wouldn&#039;t because they need to get their experience on the street dealing with bread and butter matters, give them three or four years on the streets/proactive units etc before going into a CID office as TDC
1,4882,1249,4736,why is there a need for people to sacrifice their own time to wait by a telephone for no extra payment
1,4883,1261,4832,agreed enough change, stop now
1,4884,1267,4579,Need to rely on team to preserve reputation
1,4885,1248,4840,What does partnership and community engagement really mean within volume crime?
1,4886,1262,4739,opportunities not threats
1,4887,1241,4579,lack of support of officers within phase 3 icidp
1,4888,1245,4579,no training in presentations/briefings to large groupos
1,4889,1261,4580,poor training
1,4890,1253,4864,hear hear
1,4891,1259,4887,How about through all 3 phases?
1,4892,1251,4691,on call 1 week in 5 do 8 hour day and get called in for critical incidents, no extra pay no car any extra hours worked can be taken off the following day. unacceptable tie on family and self. often work long hours and unable to ake time off

1,4899,1271,4893,entry to course when DI or selected for this role
1,4900,1275,4926,The contents of the SIO development program, not nec to the same level of knowledge but a good understanding is required to be able to effectively deal with the initial stages of any major/serious crime so as not to lose any forensic or investigative opportunities
1,4901,1274,4894,best practice/experience from a practicioner - case studies<br />Thinking outside the box but appreciating the ramifications - policy decisions<br />learning from peer group
1,4902,1274,4894,Assessment/recognition of DI&#039;s innovation - freedom to be creative/manage - avoid micro management of DI&#039;s<br />Thorough training for role

1,5010,1247,4914,Good as family friendly etc but has draw back becuase often takes some time to complete all the modules
1,5011,1248,4951,For CI&#039;s that are Crimes they have primary responsibilty in the intial stages. They must understand how to ID such an incident and what the appropriate action might be.
1,5012,1243,4954,Suitable accomodation is essential to enhance the role of the DI and the perceived value of the role
1,5013,1261,4910,distance learning loses all classroom discussion and sharing of experience
1,5014,1254,4895,Operational planning and risk assessments
1,5015,1250,4908,The actual process of decision making
1,5016,1247,4915,Who is going to mentor, we have so few officers with the experience to be able to creditably mentor someone
1,5017,1248,4945,ACPO definition
1,5018,1256,4945,It is the responsibility of officers of all ranks to recognise potential critical incidents, this applies equally to the rank of DI
1,5019,1261,4927,don&#039;t think so, about 25% investigator 75% manager
1,5020,1268,4939,PII/Court applications
1,5021,1262,5008,Its not and should not be reflected in the course
1,5022,1253,4964,This almost needs to be achieved at national level before anything can be done to redress the downward performance of CID, the perception that it is detrimental to careers - and the massive recruitment and retention problems in CID in every Force
1,5023,1257,5011,only the initial stages?
1,5024,1250,4927,This is surely a comment that is not reflective of all 43 forces
1,5025,1260,4956,Not to many else it will become distance learning cause it&#039;s much cheaper!
1,5026,1267,4894,Publication of rewards and recognition events/activities
1,5027,1268,4931,including NIM diary..DMM/Level 1/level 2
1,5028,1254,4945,There is an agreed definition, but this is open to interpretation. When does it end-it always has abeginning, but not an end.
1,5029,1253,4893,Management of staff:- to include input on professional standards, welfare, Regs, working time, unsatisfactory performance
1,5030,1276,4913,the role of a di needs to be established and defined in order that their specific needs can be catered for
1,5031,1252,5000,practical hydra style exercises are critical to learning decision making skills and developing confidence in new DI&#039;s<br />Recording and explaining decsions made is a skill
1,5032,1262,4903,nonsense, it is tested by other means, eg ospre, lets move on
1,5033,1259,4956,Are to be avoided - they are often ignored because they are too lengthy and complex - their subject matter is often repeated in the course - how do you ensure thry have been read? - will the DI have time to read it?
1,5034,1256,4895,Decide first on the role of a DI before you try to assess what that person needs to be able to do
1,5035,1250,4893,What about ongoing development, after the start of a DI&#039;s development what next
1,5036,1260,4990,Please not more input on this. Weve all had it we should all be aware of it on the course without any further input.
1,5037,1261,4898,this is becoming increasingly difficult to acheive,and will take less training to acheive than all the other bits of the role now required ie the management bits
1,5038,1241,4894,CPD
1,5039,1253,4895,Investigative standards - some Forces have them, many do not
1,5040,1254,4951,Does the gold and silver group actually understand the commands it sends to the practitioners and how does this correlate to policy/decision logs.
1,5041,1244,4901,ensure lecturing practicioner has proven track record with credibility/ still active within field of investigation management
1,5042,1267,4894,ensure that the valuing of creativity and flair is a competency area of supervisors for which evidence must be gathered
1,5043,1268,5005,Difficult as DI&#039;s have numerous specialist roles<br />proactive<br />CPT<br />serious crime<br />policy,etc etc<br />Needs to be for a generic DI&#039;s post based on Division
1,5044,1260,4973,These are inputs that should be given upon promotion within ranks and have no place in a DI&#039;s course.
1,5045,1253,5039,This is not about being able to act as a detective by reading manuals or taking a distance learning package, but having a corporate standard and knowing risk assessment between standards as you prioritise
1,5046,1261,4903,why? dont you know it already by now.
1,5047,1276,4956,distance learning will never work unless<br />1. support is readily available for the person undergoing the distance learning<br />2. sufficent WORKING TIME is given to the individual and not expected  to do the work in his/her own time
1,5048,1254,4893,A NATIONALLY AGREED POLICY LOG/FILE AS THEY VARY TOO MUCH ACROSS FORCES.WE HAVEHOLMES 2, SO WHY NOT A GENERIC POLICY FILE THAT LINKS TO HOLMES THAT ONLY REQUIRES ONE LEVEL OF TRAINING AND UNDERSTANDING.
1,5049,1250,4933,Both crime and performance/management
1,5050,1223,4914,our group had envisaged a &quot;basic&quot; DI&#039;s course which would incorporate some things which would be equally applicable to uniform inspectors, but also overviews of more specialist areas eg covert work, but expected that if a DI went into this area of work they would need additional training...one course could not possibly equip a person to carry out all these different roles so modular in that you would need &quot;bolt ons&quot; for specialist roles
1,5051,1259,4979,Difficult to achieve?
1,5052,1272,5007,The modern role of the D/Sgt largely centres around case officer responsibility a DI will often act as the Deputy SIO gathering evidence/experience to partcipate in the SIO course.  Do ACPO understand this position I am not sure they do!!
1,5053,1268,4895,performance management must be primary
1,5054,1253,4917,we need to reintroduce high standards of pass/fail to re-establish that being a detective of any rank actually means something wortwhile and worth attaining - status
1,5055,1254,4894,Trust by senior management
1,5056,1259,4990,This should be left out - it is the auto turn off
1,5057,1223,4965,but if you situate the course far away this causes problems for some people with home commitments!
1,5058,1222,4893,policy books for major incidents<br />training needs for cot deaths and deaths in custody<br />awareness of employment law in relation to civillian staff and grievance procedures
1,5059,1250,4893,Scenario based training utilising hydra
1,5060,1276,5044,sorry, but it is vitally important for a di to be able to manage their staff, constant knowledge of issues, police regs, welfare, diversity iss vital to di&#039;s!!!!!!
1,5061,1260,4903,please no it&#039;s hard enough to get di&#039;s as it is without putting in another obstacle

1,5127,1240,5123,and this means?
1,5128,1246,5122,Yes incorporated into the six weeks.
1,5129,1280,5064,1. D/Supts, DCIs and DIs who are considered to have the potenial to be successful as SIOs<br />2. DSs with potential for development as SIOs
1,5130,1223,5113,Why Sergeants?
1,5131,1265,5111,The environment is suitable for ALL investigative training (and beyond). The MSC exercise can provide value to all who have done the SIO development programme. Refresher exercises are good idea.
1,5132,1240,5126,who is responsible for this maintenance
1,5133,1277,5110,Involvement of BCU staff in syndicates to provide an alternative interpretation on the scenario eg community impact assessment / critical incident management
1,5134,1254,5127,Identifying changing practices and procedures, keeping in touch with reality in the work place, relaying good practice into the event,
1,5135,1223,5064,Professional Standards, Managers.
1,5136,1264,5064,future users are ds and above who show potential in workplace or identified through imsc
1,5137,1256,5110,Ability to differentiate between Policy Decisions and actions. The latter, in my experience, tend to end up in Policy log which gives the wrong message as to the purpose of a Policy book.
1,5138,1280,5110,Introduction of a Review element
1,5139,1251,5110,Case study material requires constant updating - needs a simple methodology to achieve this.<br />Requires more analytical products in case material to test candidates reasoning and rationale in their decision making processes.
1,5140,1258,5110,Need for more detail around the scenes to complete assessments
1,5141,1260,5137,absolutely correct.....log training issue?
1,5142,1260,5124,correct use of the syntax?
1,5143,1262,5110,More IT support. An alternative scenario to prevent contamination.<br />The flexibility to bring in new legislation to the feeds
1,5144,1240,5110,Greater use of the independent advisors and other external agencies such as probation
1,5145,1280,5110,Facility to intoduce &amp; share good practice
1,5146,1264,5110,varyation in outcomes / names so as to avoid contamination
1,5147,1277,5110,More time to reflect after the incident is concluded, this is where the real learning and development occurs. Maybe a reflective journal per student
1,5148,1254,5132,there lies the problem, once upon a time the MSC deliverers met every 2-3 months and exchanged views and innovative ideas,
1,5149,1265,5115,MSC exercise can help &#039;close the loop&#039; for others such as Professional Standards DCI / DI / Dsupt, especially if part of SIO Development Programme &amp; competency based workplace evidential portfolio building
1,5150,1280,5110,Introduction of specialist inputs in evenings to cover issues raised by students
1,5151,1258,5110,Automatic system for upgrading thedates used in the exercise
1,5152,1277,5110,Burn out of role players - H&amp;S considerations bearing in mind the nature of the material
1,5153,1260,5138,how can we achieve this?
1,5154,1223,5121,Surely not as students of the SIODP. Perhaps as Commanders that would be affected by such issues.
1,5155,1264,5110,could consider an office manager / typist in syndicates to focus more on decision making of students
2,5156,0,0,What difficulties or frustrations do you have about the delivery of the course -
1,5157,1258,5147,Reflective journal as part of SIO pack
1,5158,1277,5145,Vital - share and share alike we should complement not compete
1,5159,1256,5140,One of the drawbacks of the system. There is nothing like an actual scene (albeit mockup) to make an assessment.
1,5160,1253,5147,We sometimes task the groups to review decision logs and pick a good/ productive example and a poor/negative one. This exercise works well but we seldom have time for it.
1,5161,1240,5158,do we?
1,5162,1254,5146,why not different scenarios, a library of exercises and the ability to pick at random which one to deliver. This might also help in the ongoing development of the SIOs with refresher training!!
1,5163,1223,5117,This raises the issue of the subject material being homicide focused as opposed to being more generic or developing courses for such specialists.
1,5164,1280,5110,Introduction of new case studies as the existing one is being recognised by students with a lessening of impact
1,5165,1265,5136,IMSC can include Hydra exercise aimed at DS rank, leaving SIOs to the MSC exercise
1,5166,1251,5110,All material used needs to have currency i.e. policy, law, SOP&#039;s etc. We require a single repository for this, so that all training centres can contribute.
1,5167,1277,5155,We use experienced D/Sgts as loggists everybody learns and develops
1,5168,1258,5155,System used in PSNI D/S per syndicate for this purpose
1,5169,1267,5155,definately - the entering of decisions ends up being a focal point with some groups as opposed to the actual decision making process - problem would be resourcing this ie finance
1,5170,1223,5156,Finding and keeping suitably trained and credible trainers.
2,5171,0,0,How similar is the programme across the sites does this matter and if so who will police
1,5172,1256,5155,Resource intensive, but alot of student time is spent typing which, when they are, is time lost in the learning process.
1,5173,1277,5156,Time management
1,5174,1240,5170,does this include facliltators
1,5175,1265,5117,Separate exercise required focused on the special requirement s of the target audience
1,5176,1277,5156,Identifying Suitable role players
1,5177,1267,5161,in my experience - yes
1,5178,1280,5156,Considerable variations in knowledge and experience of students hampers progress
1,5179,1262,5156,Varied skill/experience of delegate. Keeping the role players up to date with changes and not burning them out
1,5180,1240,5176,Do you pay them?
1,5181,1251,5156,Lack of knowledge and understanding of HYDRA concept by Senior Mangers, regarding time and energy require to keep material and exercise current and relevant. It&#039;s seen as just another course!!!
1,5182,1260,5166,a dedicated Hydra research centre - providing enviromental scanning/feedback ?
1,5183,1253,5150,Other than the resident consultant SIO dealing with the issues how would this be managed?
1,5184,1265,5133,works really well, particularly in conjunction with community leader role play
1,5185,1256,5147,Reflective journal now part of the new 3 week NSLEC course.
1,5186,1277,5171,I dont know...I have run our programme for 2 years only recently have we really started to come together as practitioners
1,5187,1240,5181,there is a need to develop a DVD that explains both the Hydra concept and the course
1,5188,1264,5156,students often have unrealistic expectations of when to get results of actions eg forensics just because they percieve they are in training environment need to balance giving info to move scenario on with accurate expectations when return to operations
1,5189,1280,5156,As the course is not assessed there is no recognition of skill level,commitment or performance or lack of same
1,5190,1277,5180,Yes but we cannot get long term commitments
1,5191,1240,5186,did you know that the whole Hydra concept was designed around a zero cost community of ideas
1,5192,1267,5150,This could also be opened to a wider audience to attend to assist in CPD
1,5193,1223,5174,No, facilitators are achievable with perhaps not the level of experience and credibility one would desire. The actual course director/trainer is critical I feel to maintain the learning &amp; development.
1,5194,1254,5153,The 2nd pilot of the SIO exercise at Wyboston introduced a review on the final day by selecting  different areas of the investigation and moving the syndicates into their neighbours room and tasking them to prepare a critique of the syndicates action/decisions in one of these areas. This was followed by a lively debate in the plenary room. Worked very well
1,5195,1260,5121,perhaps use them in briefing role-plays?
1,5196,1262,5173,Are you referring to the speed at which the scenaro moves and keeping on track?
1,5197,1265,5150,the days on the MSC exercise are long enough - students are immersed in their case study and may not want to switch off from that
1,5198,1264,5171,my perception is the scenario and learning objectives are the same how trainers reach the objectives may well vary but doesnt really matter
1,5199,1240,5190,is there any opportunity to develop a pool of role players that would be available to all
1,5200,1277,5185,Is it?
1,5201,1267,5178,Similar issues when attendees are from different forces and have different policies over certain issues or the set up of departments is different
1,5202,1240,5189,will be dealt with in a section all to itself
1,5203,1260,5187,this is a great idea - perhaps JC could be the main character
1,5204,1280,5156,Suspicion that officers are being &#039;signed off&#039; to fill existing vacancies rather than because they have actually achieved the relevant competencies
1,5205,1277,5169,Collaborative arrangement with Force MIT
1,5206,1251,5171,In general, fairly similar, but it must allow the development of material to address local issues.<br />Concerned there has been no review of learning outcomes from the various tasks. Do we all deliver the same tasks? - I don&#039;t know.
1,5207,1253,5156,Lack of individual coaching /review at the end of each day or the week when weaknesses are evident or the student has been coasting  within the team.
1,5208,1280,5171,How can we know?
1,5209,1258,5110,Amapping system attached tothe exercise would be useful
1,5210,1265,5156,the recognition of the performance of individuals within syndicates is an area that would benefit from research
1,5211,1277,5191,Yes. Great in theory but not my experience in practice
2,5212,0,0,Asessment Assessment Assessment whats the real story
1,5213,1277,5196,Yes pressure on the facilitators is also intense
1,5214,1256,5204,Should be picked up by IV or EV (NSLEC) under the PIP L3 process
1,5215,1258,5212,Makes students defensive
1,5216,1280,5171,When do SIOs or trainers meet to share experience and identify gaps in learning outcomes
1,5217,1222,5191,what does &quot;zero cost community of ideas&quot; mean?
1,5218,1277,5202,When will that occur
1,5219,1254,5193,I disagree the facilitators make or break the exercise, they need to have either the operational experience themselves or the benifit of experts in the room to call on, resident SIO. This has issues if they are still operational in being called out mid course.
1,5220,1240,5208,what has the support of the NCPE been in both the design and maintenance of the programme
1,5221,1265,5110,new scenario needed even though the existing one hits all the right spots
1,5222,1246,5212,who asesses the assessors ???
1,5223,1251,5208,At one time there were regular meetings managed by NCF and ideas and material exchanged. Mismanagement by NCF!!!
1,5224,1258,5216,This could be the start
1,5225,1280,5171,By what criteria are SIOs selected?
1,5226,1240,5212,what about the confict of a safe learning environment and an assessment centre
1,5227,1265,5212,research required into performance of individuals within syndicates
1,5228,1252,5192,Shouldn&#039;t this learning take place during the 3 week SIO course - a good idea to open evening lectures to previous students
1,5229,1256,5210,A concern is how to monitor and address the student who hides behind the experience of others in the syndicate.
1,5230,1262,5212,Do the trainers and consultant sio need to be trained assessors
1,5231,1277,5212,In the very dynamic arena that Hydra generates how do 2 facilitators fairly assess 12 students
1,5232,1253,5171,allowing for local variations and procedures is just about okay but if we accredite all SIO&#039;s nationally then they need the same input eg if a force does not use the IAG system then they have to have it in their training
1,5233,1268,5230,what would they be assessing
1,5234,1246,5230,For credability the answer must be yes.
1,5235,1223,5215,But they will have to evidence the NOS&#039;s for their role so why not start  now! It is not as if they&#039;ll be sacked because of it.
1,5236,1251,5212,This element of training shouldn&#039;t be assessed - they get assessed in the workplace and this should take place before they come on the course (MSC) - otherwise they shouldn&#039;t be there.
1,5237,1254,5186,Not quite true, we used to but it stopped as some key players were no longer involved in this event to the same degree
1,5238,1258,5230,I wouldthink they need to be A1
1,5239,1277,5212,Hydra is a developmental tool - assessment should take place in the workplace. Discuss?
1,5240,1260,5212,&#039;safe learning environment&#039; ethos?
1,5241,1256,5170,A problem across all areas of police training. Very little in way of incentive / reward for trainers
1,5242,1264,5212,there is no getting away from assessment at some later stage of the program but the key is who does the assessing and what is their credible right to assess and against what criteria also what do you do with those who arn&#039;t yet competent must have processes to identfy and be strong enough to action plan
1,5243,1254,5223,Hence we are here today to get back on track
1,5244,1267,5226,The assessment should be for development needs and not a pass/fail scenario - after all, is there any such thing as a perfect investigation?
1,5245,1258,5225,There is nowa National criteria for entry to the programme
1,5246,1223,5230,Due to the introduction of PIP it would be useful and credible if they were, so that they were creating the right context in which their students would be working.
1,5247,1256,5176,Local drama groups or colleges
1,5248,1258,5225,Need more of this type of user group to share information
1,5249,1265,5212,assessment is part of all of our working lives. The way in which this can be achieved in syndicate based activities needs research. The credibility of the assessors is crucial.
1,5250,1251,5231,In fairness to the candidates and facilitators this cannot be objectively achieved.
1,5251,1268,5239,absolutely where would creativity and flair be if the assessment criteria were known by the students, they would be playing to the gallery like perfoming monkeys.  The would deliver on the Occupational Standards but become focussed on just that, surely, discuss
1,5252,1267,5235,They may not be sacked but they could be extremely vulnerable next time they are in the box
1,5253,1260,5239,absolutely right - people should enjoy/look forward to this fantastic training tool - not fear it for fear of being &#039;scored&#039;
1,5254,1280,5156,What process should be in place to monitor the success ir otherwise of the SIO DP.? Will reviewers be asked to comment on the performance of the SIO as part of terms of reference.  Will Head of CID do this as part of CPD
1,5255,1262,5233,Does the current/new scenario need to have specific assessment areas written in to support continued development under the pip process.
1,5256,1256,5178,shouldn&#039;t be a problem if PIP L3 selection criteria is rigoursly applied
1,5257,1268,5212,Are you aware of the self assessment model that has been developed supported by evidence from the field
1,5258,1264,5212,you have to show competency under pressure sooner or later if british airways have a pilot who could not land a jumbo jet in a simulator would they still let them have a go for real?
1,5259,1280,5254,If so how will that be fed back to centre
1,5260,1253,5212,Occasionally we get a student who &#039;performs&#039; throughout the week as if it was an assessment centre. This is detrimental to the group and the course and convinces me it should be avoided
1,5261,1258,5212,What about the problem when someone is assessed in the workplace already as competent then they fail the hydra where does that leave us
1,5262,1256,5189,A very valid point
1,5263,1223,5239,Assessment focusses the mind. All learning is an opportunity and failing now and again happens.
1,5264,1254,5240,I can try it out and if it works talk about why it did, if it did not likewise talk about why it did not but without the burden of a failed prosecution, public enquiry or worse a disaffected family and community. I can learn without limiting my career
1,5265,1277,5253,Completely agree despite the fact that they are investigating a horrific scenario the process must be an enjoyable one or credibility is destroyed.
1,5266,1265,5236,what&#039;s the purpose of the exercise if not to allow the students to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding?
1,5267,1280,5257,How reliable is self assessment?
1,5268,1260,5261,self assessment is another issue altogether. Professionals must learn from their own Hydra experiences
1,5269,1222,5212,You can&#039;t simulate everything
1,5270,1251,5246,A necessity for the overall programme, but HYDRA Simulated exercise cannot be assessed - is this not contrary to NOS guidelines?
1,5271,1268,5250,it would cause massive problems if disclosed in a court case and the officer then suggested that the assessment was not fair or realistic in an environment where he or she was beholdent to the performance of other members of their team
1,5272,1223,5269,You can try!
1,5273,1256,5231,I am confused. I thought that the 1 week exercise was only a self assessment by the students themselves.
1,5274,1254,5263,Assessment can get the student to regurgitate the words from the book, not nec the understanding
1,5275,1260,5264,exactly why assessment is a negative word in Hydra world!
1,5276,1253,5212,Same as &#039;education education education&#039; = lots of hot air very little tangible progress from the norm
1,5277,1268,5267,hugely if it is the basis for discussions with the course director and the joint completion of a development programme that would be evidenced in the workplace
1,5278,1265,5239,It&#039;s a great environment to demonstrate to individuals the areas they need to improve upon. Is their any research on methods of &#039;self-assessment&#039;?
1,5279,1268,5276,yes yes
1,5280,1258,5156,Sometimes the MET  influence in the exercise turns some delegates off
1,5281,1223,5270,Not that I am aware. Surely trainers need to know the context in which their students will be working and the pressures they will be facing.
1,5282,1252,5163,The skills learned are generic and equaly applicable to any specialism
1,5283,1254,5242,The development program if not defective should highlight deficencies before they attend the final practice on hydra.
1,5284,1277,5212,What is so wrong with student created action plans, facilitator endorsed following individual tutorial
1,5285,1256,5261,Can you fail HYDRA? what is the assessment criteria. I have asked before and told that there isn&#039;t one.
1,5286,1265,5258,And Hydra is the ideal environment to demonstrate competency and good judgement - but how do we recognise it?
1,5287,1254,5268,The way forward surely, I must feel safe to participate, if I do then I am likely to be self critical, if you assess me I am going to try and hide my failings and see if I can get away with it, this leads to incompetent SIO&#039;s. defeating the objective surely
1,5288,1260,5171,Trainers &amp; SIO consultants could commit to spending once a year to visiting and running other Hydra MSC sites, to encourage cross fertilisation of ideas
2,5289,0,0,How could we work together more effectively
1,5290,1260,5289,a monthly MSC forum on 10Kv on the web?
1,5291,1254,5289,By consultation
1,5292,1246,5289,Regular contact / working group.
1,5293,1267,5289,a chatroom - not dissimilar to this system but accessible through the web
1,5294,1240,5291,what would that look like
1,5295,1223,5289,I understood there was a Hydra Managers forum. Do they not share products, innovations etc?
1,5296,1262,5289,web site forum?
1,5297,1277,5290,Excellent idea - why not?
1,5298,1277,5289,Trainer exchange programme supported by user Forces
1,5299,1260,5293,see above!
1,5300,1267,5295,I think that tends to be more from the tecchy angle rather than the products
1,5301,1256,5290,saves having to travel 3 1/2 hours each way to take part
1,5302,1254,5289,As I commented in the earlier question, bring back the regular meetings, with a purpose not just a jolly, The networking is important
1,5303,1222,5298,Swop Shop?
1,5304,1264,5289,trainers could cross over to other facilities and train at other centres to spread varyation and other angles to approach same objectives
1,5305,1267,5299,patients is a virtue - some are not as quick on the keyboard
1,5306,1260,5290,perhaps less often - three monthly?
1,5307,1222,5298,On a bridge...foggy morning...Berlin?
1,5308,1246,5298,excellent idea good opportunity for cross pollination
1,5309,1268,5289,what about an alumni conference where graduates could meet and talk about the developments in the sio world, run exclusively for them
1,5310,1267,5305,spelling is also an issue!
1,5311,1223,5289,Within the NCPE &#039;communications strategy&#039; a protocol could be developed.
1,5312,1277,5302,Completely agree - specific achievable agenda items For example community impact assessment
1,5313,1262,5298,I will work on any abroad!
1,5314,1251,5292,6 monthly meeting and exchange of material.
1,5315,1265,5289,a national product with national learning outcomes
1,5316,1260,5310,if curse it si
1,5317,1254,5289,How many of the sites have run an MSC without asking for the attendance of an SIO or facilitator who has experience in running the program?
1,5318,1265,5292,6 monthly meetings by exercise leaders and staff would be advantageous
1,5319,1268,5290,10kv did operate on the web for the borough commanders for the london bombings, it is not difficult to set up and would operate say for a whole day allowing the team to dip in and out of the discussions
1,5320,1260,5309,like it
1,5321,1256,5298,Who going to foot the bill for travel, food and accomodation?
1,5322,1251,5289,Do we need to have a review of exercise and supporting material with all centres contributing?
1,5323,1258,5315,do the debrief points and the aims and objective be thesame as the 3 week course
1,5324,1268,5300,there needs to be a specific professional group around the sio programme with invitees from the DI programme so that they can be developed in parallel
1,5325,1223,5304,This would meet collaboration agendas but perhaps unrealisitic.
1,5326,1253,5289,A 10000 volt type system where each centre can answer a set of criteria to be entered at the end of each MSC along the lines of, elements that worked well/poorly new material/updates accessible from all sites. web site?<br />Repetion of above - oops
1,5327,1260,5319,lets do it
1,5328,1254,5295,There are sites around the country such as our colleagues from Avon and somerset who run the MSC but not on hydra. They have valuable ideas so to restrict it to Hydra user groups would exclude them
1,5329,1277,5321,Think outside the box - why be negative - sponsors
1,5330,1265,5292,a meeting would enable  critical evaluation of new media (audio/video) which could then be shared
1,5331,1268,5317,this is such a major weakness as the whole event is reliant on the skills of the facilitator
1,5332,1222,5329,Who?
1,5333,1268,5311,another strategy heh?
1,5334,1260,5290,Still necessary for regular face to face forums, but an hur every quarter would be very dynamic in creating new ideas and developing not only MSC but any Hydra course?
1,5335,1280,5289,Regular conferences arranged by NCPE, to share experience both good and bad, and agree common standards &amp; best practice on the lines of current Negotiator Coordinators and  Heads of CID conferences.  Reviewing Officers should be able to either feed into or directly participate in these conferences so that training reflects experience on the street,
1,5336,1256,5332,Good point
1,5337,1251,5295,I thought this was more to do with addressing technical and IT issues?
1,5338,1265,5292,if a new exercise is imminent, we will have a national product, but if not, what don&#039;t all existing centres who have run the msc for some time get together to run through what works for them and why?
1,5339,1268,5321,surely this is a cost for NCPE to bear, if it takes the credit for the course surely it should keep it fresh
1,5340,1254,5325,This has been done, and can be effective, needs the local aspect bought in by a local rep
1,5341,1223,5317,I cannot believe anyone would run such a course without an experienced SIO involved! Where&#039;s the credibility?
1,5342,1267,5324,One could influence the other without too much cross over
1,5343,1256,5329,Not negative -realistic and practical
1,5344,1264,5321,swing and roundabouts comes to mind
1,5345,1268,5342,exactly but now they seem to be in silos
1,5346,1260,5339,commitment
1,5347,1280,5289,Clone Dave Crompton and issue one to each centre
1,5348,1258,5322,This would seem to be a logical starting point
1,5349,1278,5312,Must be limited to key players only,this was part of the reason for the failure of the users group before. Too many people throwing in ideas, nobody able to action everything, it became a talk shop.&#039;
1,5350,1277,5336,Hardware - software manufacturers?.<br />Private Companies in the crime prevention field?<br />Michael Winner....?
1,5351,1265,5309,sounds like a jolly - it&#039;s difficult enough to get operational offciers on to the exercises anyway. Aren&#039;t their enough means by which regional &amp; national best parctice are shared anyway?
1,5352,1222,5315,National products do not always do the job - there should always be flexibility to deal with more &#039;local&#039; issues
1,5353,1223,5347,We couldn&#039;t afford one!
1,5354,1265,5309,Have all those running the existing MSC been involved in the development of the new exercise or consulted?
1,5355,1256,5323,nationally agreed QA process, results fed back into NSLEC
1,5356,1264,5304,there are times when co-trainers are unavailable rather than draft in a sub from force who is unfamiliar with process or training environment then mutual aid a trainer from another centre and reciprocate when necessary
1,5357,1277,5289,There is a place for technology - web chat?  alongside personal exchange - face to face meetings why not a combination of strategies
1,5358,1265,5347,His name is Dave Niccol
1,5359,1223,5347,Can we have one that tells jokes too?
1,5360,1260,5326,difficult as MSC&#039;s are run at different times at different centres - who would run the 10Kv - not every centre would participate....
1,5361,1222,5347,Dave - stick your hand up
1,5362,1251,5296,I thought this was set up by NCALT a few years ago - does it still exsist???<br />Some forces had difficulty getting access because of security firewalls.
1,5363,1260,5347,god forbid!!!
2,5364,0,0,Great ideas team but now the reality what are we going to do?
1,5365,1222,5357,Face to face meetings are vital - e-mail me with more of these good ideas
1,5366,1264,5347,signed dave crompton
1,5367,1240,5364,in the next 10 weeks
1,5368,1260,5357,co-ordinationon on a national basis
1,5369,1256,5309,Would fit in with the CPD requirement of the PIP L3 re-registartion process
1,5370,1240,5364,in the next 10 months
1,5371,1254,5367,Next ten minutes lets talk :)
1,5372,1260,5365,e-mail address?
1,5373,1223,5367,Task NCPE with developing a strategy within 4/6wks for formal sharing of material and a forum in which in can be done.
1,5374,1246,5367,Go spread the Gospel and make the regular forums happen !
1,5375,1267,5367,The question before - whose responsibility has to be answered before any realistic decisions can be made
1,5376,1254,5367,Lets identify who should meet when and how
1,5377,1277,5367,create a current  national user / interested parties circulation list - should take 10 minutes
1,5378,1256,5367,focus group looking at all the delivery centres to identify good /  bad practice and disseminate out to everyone
1,5379,1265,5370,if the new exercise is ready in this timescale, let&#039;s get together and let the developerstalk it through so their ideas aren&#039;t misinterpreted
1,5380,1262,5364,Create a feedback sheet, make an agenda schedule a meeting of a user group? Set specific tasks to each Hydra force user?
1,5381,1223,5373,I agree this must be a Centrex/NCPE responsibility.
1,5382,1246,5376,Has to be Hydra practitioners ( and those coming on board).
1,5383,1253,5364,can we know how often the MSC will be run nationally within the next 10 weeks/ten months?
1,5384,1265,5367,establish who has ownership and the national remit for the development of the MSC
1,5385,1264,5367,need to analyse and prioitise the workshop statements and work towards discussion of what ideas to implement / discard
1,5386,1280,5373,As this probably means leaving one or two very busy people to do the work can we agree a way forward today
1,5387,1251,5367,agree the formation of a steering committe/group to review comments of today and formulate a stratgey to progress some of the great ideas.
1,5388,1265,5373,task Kevin to do this
1,5389,1277,5367,Cancel all leave for DI Kevin Smart
1,5390,1254,5370,Lets start the process and aim to have completed an identified program of alignment, so we all deliver to the same basic standards and same aim/objectives. this would still allow the flexability for individual local needs
1,5391,1265,5378,who would be the focus group - sounds like assessors coming round to assess what we&#039;re doing
1,5392,1267,5380,create a feedback sheet and ensure it is downloaded onto an accessible website by users - best practice can then be exchanged
1,5393,1223,5388,If you want something done ask a busy man!
1,5394,1268,5382,yes there is a user group this should be specifically for the MSC it is so important
1,5395,1258,5370,need to collate at NCPE all future planned courses
1,5396,1260,5392,INCSCID?
1,5397,1268,5375,no I disagree this is where it all goes wrong, lets just take control of this ourselves the ones who have the task of delivering the product, the strategy will follow
1,5398,1223,5370,Evaluate the ten week plan and make it better!
1,5399,1277,5364,Get some provisional agreement around the room / around the country
1,5400,1251,5370,delegates from today and others all to meet and review in depth the new case scenario before it formally launched
1,5401,1254,5382,I disagree, it should be those delivering the MSC, the non hydra users will soon learn that they are perhaps missing a trick, if NCPE (kevin) allow non users to continue to deliver when acreditation is fully implemented
1,5402,1258,5367,National feedback form available now
1,5403,1264,5399,can we keep the lap tops
1,5404,1268,5396,www.incscid.org will show you about it.. in a mo
1,5405,1280,5376,I thought this was why we came here today. How many of those present today want to  be actively involved and are in a position to make a useful contribution.
1,5406,1253,5367,Have a similar exercise after the next course to be run ie all meet in Sth wales , if it is there,and work throught the issues. Move the review group around the country on a four monthly basis to the site of the latest course.
1,5407,1268,5403,intimate search at reception unfortunately followed by deep cleansing of the laptop
1,5408,1265,5380,all Hydra centres should contribute but resources levels vary widely between centres
1,5409,1254,5379,Absolutely, we will need to have a good understanding of the route the exercise is designed to take the group
1,5410,1260,5403,help us pack them away at the end and we&#039;ll think about it!!!
1,5411,1265,5403,can we keep the sweets?
1,5412,1251,5384,Surely we all have ownership, remit for development must be with NCPE?
1,5413,1268,5411,ok
1,5414,1252,5383,MPS will run 3 over next 10 months with capacity for one or two more
1,5415,1265,5400,definitley to the last comment it has resource implications
1,5416,1253,5364,10.10.10. have we gone decimal?

1,5538,1564,5511,Risk is dynamic and subjective; it cannot be successfully reduced to &#039;tick box&#039; criteria
1,5539,1552,5511,The identifying of areas of concern that  that could impact on:<br />An individual<br />A group of people<br />An organisation
1,5540,1568,5511,should enable you to develop a balanced strategy to deal with a specific problem.  The risk assesment is an evolving process which should be reviewed regularly to ensure the correct approach.
1,5541,1544,5511,Is based on the known and what can reasonably be anticipated having considered that information. It is a constantly evolving process which must be centered around an individuals risk to personal harm.
1,5542,1564,5511,Risk and danger are concepts that lack common understanding engendering confusion and poor decision making
1,5543,1548,5511,How to weigh the relative advantage/disadvantage in deciding to take (or not to take) action in any given situation
1,5544,1571,5511,Any review of danger to people or organisation with a view to taking action to minimise that danger. Can include physical dangers or danger to reputation.
1,5545,1574,5511,Risk is future - not past: It is what is foreseeable or anticipated and the overriding factor in determining risk is information. Once you have information you can determine its significance by attributing weight to it according to the circumstances.Therefore, the first step in any risk assessment is the steps taken to obtain information and then to give it some weight by evaluating it over time and in light of information you already have and information that emerges.
1,5546,1561,5511,risk is reduced through clarity of thought and direction to others
1,5547,1555,5511,Risk should be about asessing the agencies/stakeholders involved in the arena and understaning the criteria then scoring accordingly.  Interventions can then implemented against high risk areas and a plan can be developed
1,5548,1559,5511,Risk - a perception, based on experience and interpretation of data available or not available, of potentially undesirable outcomes. Risk in a policing context is invariably a negative, although in other areas in has a stronger association with opportunities as well as threats.

1,5553,1549,5511,understand the longer term consequences and determine if preventive action can be taken
1,5554,1561,5511,risk is never really eliminated
1,5555,1541,5511,Risk assessments will change depending upon changing factors around which the original assessment was made.
1,5556,1563,5511,There are risks of someone having things done to them and risks of someone putting themself in harms way
1,5557,1566,5511,might need to be dynamic in order to be effective
1,5558,1550,5533,no - rosemary is the spice of life
1,5559,1565,5511,*Agencies set off &#039;acting&#039; on problems without sharing knowledge.<br />*Some agencies STILL think their clients personal information cannot be shared until they are dead or in prison.<br />*Task number one is to open up the information or the respnsible authorities to each other.<br />*Task number two is to have jiont assessment of risks to prevent harm or reoccurence.<br />* A problem solving approach - Scan all info. - Analyse - Then respond - further assessment.
1,5560,1543,5511,Risk is a spectrum, not a static concept.  It refers to the judgement/ perception of likelihood of harm (mental, physical, emotional).  It is assessed, and its level is calculated by, the quantity/ type/ severity of known factors, and professional expertise and experience.
1,5561,1547,5511,This is a gathering and analysis of information available to determine current  risk to safety. It supposes that :<br />this helps determine further information required,<br />assessment is ongoing<br />that the process is within a collaborative system<br />that decisions are clear and actioned, with agency lead responsibilites agreed<br />that risk is considered within a framework of assessing family and child &#039;s needs.

1,5564,1557,5527,what if you have not even started working to avoid it  - have not recdognised the problem?
1,5565,1561,5511,there is a risk that we become so bound by strategy that we never take action
1,5566,1573,5545,You are assessing future risk but part of a risk assesment must take in what has happenned in the past including near misses
1,5567,1562,5511,There is a need to be trained in assessing risk
1,5568,1548,5538,It might be possible to reduce matters to a &#039;tick box &#039; in those circumstances where the consequences of taking action/not taking action are actually known in precise terms
1,5569,1574,5519,This far too simpllistic as definition - although a useful tool fir H&amp;S pourposes it is rather two dimensional
1,5570,1549,5538,are we so overwhelmed by risk of very seious harm that wecannot identify risk which can be mediated

1,5584,1573,5574,culture, race or belief will create barriers to communication.  During the golden hour of a potential critical incident the lead agencies will have to revert to their primary objective and try thier best to deal with these barriers.  After this initial stage is achieved ie, (Save life, preserve evidence and secure witnesses) then the agencies will then be able to use extensive consultation and advice from faith and diverse groups to plan strategically.
1,5585,1546,5577,This is an age old problem of organising joint events; ensuring that all groups are equally represented. No matter how well you market the event, no matter how well you cajole your colleagues, no matter how much you plead with them to come..you cannot guarantee that there will be an effective and fair spread. &quot;You can lead a horse to water......&quot;
1,5586,1574,5572,The reality of info sharing is that not much of it goes on with confidence. There is no real guidance that encourages practitioners to be proactive (i.e. &quot;I will share unless there are good reasons not to&quot; as opposed to &quot;I won&#039;t share unless there are good reasons why I should&quot;) abd tghe recent X govt guidance only heightens that fear abd uncertainty.
1,5587,1568,5574,This is an important element to all agency interaction with the community they serve, it should not be a bar to information sharing or appropriate action as the child irrespective of race colour or creed must come first.
1,5588,1546,5583,Exactly what part are the police expected to play in the CAF ?
1,5589,1573,5578,one problem about info sharing from a police point of view is the potential of long term damage caused by the source of the information being identified which in the long term may prevent intelligence that may save many lifes

1,5592,1566,5572,fear of legislation/ignorance prevents effective info sharing
1,5593,1549,5583,Useful to run the exercise using the CAF - Would it have helped us?
1,5594,1552,5582,the day has focussed on the Child Protection procedures and processes, I would like to support the development and recognition of the policing role in Preventative Early Intervention work with children and young people
1,5595,1574,5589,agreed to a point but you cannot hide behind this statetment about protectiing sources. What you are talking about here is so very rare (compromising vulnerable or protected sources that is) that the principal has little significance in child protection info sharing
1,5596,1562,5579,A clear understanding across the police service that there is need to be more actively involved in the wider issues relating to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of all children
1,5597,1548,5578,There has to be some police specific training for each level of the service.  HOWEVER, we must not overlook the fact that without there being an additional tier of training on a regular basis between agencies then we will not expose/address the key issues which will lead to sub-optimisation of the PREVENTION  agenda
1,5598,1566,5572,we need to develop genuine cross organisational trust and awareness to achieve effective information sharing
1,5599,1545,5579,If we agre that multi agency teams are the way forwrad we should be looking to the teams already in existence and take that learning forward really accelorate this agenda.
1,5600,1561,5583,There are so many things that patrol officers are required to record/undertake that to expect them to complete a 1 hour assessment of every child they encounter would bring policing to a halt.<br />In order to ensure that what may become a vital piece of the jigsaw is not lost, they would have to do it for every child for the PC would be unaware who is subject to a SS investigation
1,5601,1568,5578,To be able to maintain a global overview of any strategy has got to be advantagous.  Perhaps that responsibility could be shouldered by a designated agency or independant body i dont know.  Some interaction may need some expertise...
1,5602,1557,5584,Culture race or belief if not see as a barrier might weel be the key to unlocking some of the perceived problems.
1,5603,1564,5578,There needs to be a common understnding of the level of commitment to which each agency should agree.
1,5604,1562,5579,Inter disciplinary training which goes beyond child abuse
1,5605,1566,5579,Joint training needs to be achieved - so how can this be made to happen?????
1,5606,1544,5572,How good is the data we wish to share?The Police have difficulty with sharing information with each other ( IT systems which don&#039;t communicate across boundries)  what chance do we have at  multi-agency level.
1,5607,1549,5582,This child was failing to achieve any of the five outcomes
1,5608,1551,5575,Although training at this level, with appropriate inter agency support is excellent for joint investigations, there is as has already been mentioned a large void of knowledge within the police service and possibly across other agencies where children are not the only work priority, this type of training cannot be deliverd to them and time should be spent developing a national training framework to deliver this level of understanding. We do not want 43 police services providing different training when one package could suit all.
1,5609,1571,5582,It is really important that operational non specialist police officers should have some understanding around these issues as they are coming into contact daily with these children. What is often lacking with operational cops is the understanding of other agencies&#039; roles. A basic course based on today&#039;s work would be really valuable as it would put their experiences into context and give them confidence to address these issues.
1,5610,1563,5579,Need to give safegaurding issues in the broad sense some real priority within police planning/performance measurement.<br />Need a concise statement of good practice in inter-agency working.<br />Need to make effective use of structures which already exist/are emerging - like Local Safeguarding Children Boards.
1,5611,1574,5597,Be re-assured that an essential component of the child abuse investigators trianing programme calls for, on a masndatory basis, muti-agency trianing to the DfES standards for target groups B &amp; C AS A MINIMUM..
1,5612,1546,5600,Let us not forget the roles and responsibilities of the special constable and the PCSO - They too may become the first responder to a potential/suspect child abuse.
1,5613,1552,5579,Multi-disciplinary teams are delivering services now to vulnerable children, what an they tell us about good prctice and learning
1,5614,1573,5579,Get each boroughs public services to risk assess whether partnership/communication and information sharing are good enougth to prevent another Victoria Colimbe.<br />where all the agencies agree that partnership, communication and info sharing are good.  prioritise them lower down list that those who say it is poor or those who do not agree
1,5615,1548,5578,What leverage points can we use to bring agencies together?  At senior (interagency level) notwithstanding our individual and collective will we may be committed but we may need &#039;honest&#039; brokers who place clear EXPECTATIONS on all relevant agencies which are backed at Ministerial level and against which we are individually inspected/assessed.
1,5616,1544,5574,Essential to effective problem solving
1,5617,1554,5575,I thought I had come here to contribute to a discussion on what the police service required in terms of training provision for the whole of the Every Child Matters agenda, not just child protection, which is only a small part of it. It also happens to be the most developed part of the requirement having 15 years of experience behind it. In terms of the five outcomes for all children we have evidence that 80% of it has a direct relationship to policing but the concept behind it is new to the vast majority of police officers and staff at all levels. There are a few of us who understand the need and are desperately trying to ensure adequate training is made available to benefit our colleagues.
1,5618,1553,5582,Single agency training is needed for practioners to thoroughly understand what the other agencies can and cannot do, legally and in terms of resources and expertise, before joint training is embarked upon.
1,5619,1564,5582,The link between early identification and safeguarding needs to be clearly articulated.
1,5620,1561,5574,Policing culture must be taken into account.<br />It is  arrogance to suggest Police have &#039;cracked&#039; child abuse investigation with out taking into account the beliefs of other agencies
1,5621,1543,5573,This is more about the people rather than agencies; it would be interesting for those of us here today, and other managers/ training organisations, to observe this same exercise being completed by four front-line practitioners (one each of health, police, social and ed.) (maybe on video?)and see how multi-agency co-operation operates at this everyday, practical level.  This could be used to identify further training needs and barriers to integrated working, some of which we may have overlooked today.
1,5622,1550,5572,Informatiom sharing is vital if we are to progress the out comes of ECM.<br />It may take further deaths for &#039;Health&#039; to change their mind set of restricting their input into the multi agency approach. When they have to justify the reasons for not sharing information after more deaths of children; they may run out of excuses and change their &#039;Victorian&#039; approach to sharing information.
1,5623,1568,5578,The key here is to keep lines of communication open.  Respect best practice.  Be self critical and adapt where necessary.
1,5624,1549,5596,Can this be driven thru the CAF?

1,5627,1566,5582,Don&#039;t get bogged down in procedure and protocols and do what is right - things happen!!
1,5628,1545,5582,Early interventions which address issues before they reach the thressholds of child protection are the responsability of all agencies. Police training should reflect the very early access Police often have to families with &#039;early risk indicators&#039; built into every strand of Policing, not leaving the issue for specialist posts
1,5629,1562,5579,Officers need to be clear on what is now expected of them when dealing with children, I am not sure that current police training does this.
1,5630,1555,5575,Through the review of the national occupational standards training can be built upon to ensure that it is consistent, fit for purpose and sustainable.  These reviews are happening currently and are planned for the future. The common core will be integrated into the reviews as is happening with the child abuse standards.  This exercise needs to be capitalised on.
1,5631,1544,5579,Get on and do it, and don&#039;t make excuses because it could be too late.
1,5632,1574,5609,Be reassured that this is recognised and is under development
1,5633,1546,5590,They are certainly areas that would require the completion of CAF, but what would the first repsonder actually have to do - the thought of &#039;first responders&#039;( Police officers, Specials,PCSO&#039;s ) having to complete an hour long form, albeit for a very good reason, is maybe too much to expect in reality ?
1,5634,1571,5578,I think the idea of an influential  and independent champion for this training is a good one.
1,5635,1564,5572,Until there is a positive duty to share information, this issue will remain unresolvable.
1,5636,1552,5575,From a Social Work perspective, the group I was in (mainly police officers), we all agreed on the strategy, action, level of risk, there was a consensus
1,5637,1542,5579,Multi agecy training starting from ground level but progressing to senior managers.<br />Giving the practitioners the support to make unpopular decisions.
1,5638,1566,5573,It is important to get a good balance of the lead agencies, without it the genuine multi-agency working doesn&#039;t take place
1,5639,1561,5617,There is no magic in recognising injury/neglect and acting on the information.<br />The magic is in opening the eyes of the partners and encouraging them to act/report
1,5640,1557,5584,the viewpoint that culture race or beleif WILL create barriers to communication is not helpful - indeed taking these aspects inot account is likely to enhance communication.
1,5641,1547,5578,I think SCIE&#039;s r&amp;d work on working with families with drug, alcohol and mental health problems could be useful to this debate, including but not only about brokerage , which our research identifies as &#039;cross-over posts&#039;<br />This is freely available on the SCIE website www.scie.org.uk , within the Children &amp; Families publications.<br />We also host a  large and active &#039;parental mental health &#039; network (details on the site) which has grown out of the original research and includes professionals, parents and young people. It demonstrates the keeness with which people work together when encouraged!
1,5642,1550,5579,Invite Health.
1,5643,1563,5578,Brokers need a clear and agreed set of objectives/best practice to broker.<br />They need some persuasive authority - a big stick!
1,5644,1562,5579,We need a long term plan which will cover the training needs of front line staff, middle managers and ACPO ranks.
1,5645,1546,5579,Senior Managers in all agencies need to recognise the importance of inter agency pro-ctivity, which includes training. Too many times the excuses have been used in the past.
1,5646,1566,5574,Must be implicit to effective action
1,5647,1549,5617,You have spent the day identfying a case of serious bullying not child abuse. Perhaps we should have idenyifiud it as bullying earlier?
1,5648,1554,5572,In order to effect the level of information sharing required to achieve success across all agencies involved in this agenda we must break down the legislative myths, personal litigation fears and agency cultures. National guidance must also be more prescriptive about the need to share information and written in a more positive style than the negative approach adopted to date.
1,5649,1574,5635,There is a positive duty (see Osman v UK and Z &amp; others v UK) but the new X govt guidance (in draft) seems to discourage it by increasing the fear factor - poor show really.
1,5650,1548,5579,For the police service we need to see a clear committment and timeline for training events at all levels of the service.  That will sharpen focus and give impetus.  Without it, possibly arguing for &#039;delay&#039; whilst we get other agencies &#039;fully engaged&#039; will only add to a sense of inertia.  If such a hiatus were to materialsie and in a worst case scenario another critical incident of &#039;Victoria Climbie proportions&#039; came to pass the police service would be in an indefensible position.
1,5651,1574,5648,hear hear
1,5652,1557,5574,culture race and beleif factors are likely to aide communication - not add barriers
1,5653,1568,5582,Knowing who your partner agencies are is key.  Also what are their limitations?
1,5654,1543,5626,Please could you clarify whether you mean support for multi-agency working generally or specifically for inter-agency brokers?
1,5655,1549,5632,Where?
1,5656,1573,5583,officers on patrol cannot be expected to complete in depth reports/risk assessments on children who come to notice.  they need a system where they can acurately and efficiently record inteligence and concerns that will be picked up fast time by specialist officers who can investigate and involve internal and external partner agencies
1,5657,1562,5583,The reality is that the majority of police officers are still unaware of the CAF, this is a straight forward training need that should be met, probably locally.
1,5658,1564,5575,I&#039;m unclear what today has been about; it certainly hasn&#039;t helped me in thinking about safeguarding children training provision as it is too aligned to the minority of children subject to s47 enquiries.
1,5659,1548,5574,There is a clear need to ensure that IAG input to future training events is built in at all stages.
1,5660,1566,5574,Should be acknoewledged - in some instances cannot divert investigation or taking of appropriate legal action
1,5661,1568,5582,The common assesment framework if succesful will lead to the early identification of problems
1,5662,1557,5574,seeing culture race and belief as barrier to communication is liley to become a self fulfilling prophecy
1,5663,1553,5582,Harm or risk of harm (or failing to meet developmental potential), is under-identified (see joint chief inspector&#039;s report), increasing recognition includes not just knowing what consitutes harm, but also having somewhere to refer the child to if you do idenify it. There should therefore be training on what the local area can offer and what the remit of the other agencies is i.e. who to or where to, refer.
1,5664,1546,5621,Speaking from a purely police perspective ( though I suspect this would apply to all agencies ) I would like to see this happening with four practitioners from the same force, from the same division/borough even - its amazing how practice/ideas may differ even between the same team - is that because of a lack of knowledge of current policies or different interpretation ?
1,5665,1561,5578,Supervisors within the police are often unaware of the implicaitons of the demands they place upon their staff, they are even less aware of the ethos/reasoning of partners. Child abuse will not stop because we have fancy procedures, it may stop if we have the strength to say it is unacceptable and do something about it
1,5666,1542,5579,Common language that all agencies understand,i.e, what do we mean by risk assessment?
1,5667,1562,5578,Shouldn&#039;t the HO be including this area of work as part of the ongoing police reform agenda?
1,5668,1564,5583,CAF and ISA are a big issue - most services are head in the sand about this
1,5669,1550,5582,We are still in the culture of waiting for deaths, incidents or crimes to happen.<br />We need to be fearless whan it comes to dealing with children and young people; keeping their interests as the focus, not human rights, red tape and other nonsense.<br />Act early, save lives; prevent crimes.
1,5670,1566,5583,Should be used and available in the immersive excercise
1,5671,1549,5656,if 2/3 of runaway children are not reported to police we are getting somethng wrong
1,5672,1561,5579,What does Laming think about this
1,5673,1547,5583,The West children disclosed to a local police constable on the beat, who knew what to do. For some children, the policemay be their only chance of safety.
1,5674,1555,5578,The government has made a commintment through the children&#039;s workforce startegy to develop an integrated qualificatations framework which is to be driven through the sector skills councils in health, education, social work, justice and lifelong learning.  Should this already established vehicle be used to start multi agency discussions on training potential
1,5675,1548,5573,Given that we are developing our thinking around ECM training I would like to see an informed voice of young people included in training events.  QWuite how this could be achieved I am not quite sure however we should try to avoid finding adult solutions to children&#039;s problems when young people might be better able to inform our thinking.  How might the inclusion of young people in traini ng events of this nature be achieved?
1,5676,1557,5574,early involvment of cultural or religious groups may aid decision making or at least prevent some bad decisions or misunderstandings which could cause communication &#039;shut down&#039; with families communities or victims.
1,5677,1550,5627,Agreed!!
1,5678,1544,5573,Rather than considering other agencies I think it would be desirable to get the key players on board in the first instance. Where are Health?
1,5679,1562,5579,A review of exisiting training to see where the ECM agenda could be included
1,5680,1543,5630,Reviews of national occupational standards against the new Championing Children guidance (skills, knowledge and behaviours for leaders and managers of integrated children&#039;s services) are similarly being undertaken at the moment, and can hopefully also be used to address training provision in this way.
1,5681,1554,5582,In the exercise used our group (social workers) activated a strategy meeting and full Section 47 joint investigation as soon as Botans case was highlighted as the focus case. This fact reflects current practice, would have changed completely the follwing stages of the exercise and indeed was not recognised in subsequent stages of the scenario. I believe this approach to training must be flexible enough to react to the decisions that are actually made by the participants.
1,5682,1561,5579,Too much waffle and not enough action, even the aim of the seminar is difficult to understand
1,5683,1568,5573,What about the parents??
1,5684,1561,5579,Who is the Champion
1,5685,1562,5579,Write some training materials with the support of other agencies which help police officers understandthe developing ECM agenda
1,5686,1566,5630,But if training is not arranged on a multi-agency basis and attendance of partners is not secured it will be pretty meaningless
1,5687,1548,5573,Connexions might be a useful addition to a list of future invitees given their interface with young people and the young persons advisors they have available to the organisation.
1,5688,1573,5575,I had hoped that this forum would have covered a wider scope than the potential critical incident discussed.  For example work around multiagency approach to preventing children from becoming victims of crime or perpertrators of crime. Generally I found my group to be very aware of the correct action to take around critical incidents and felt that the other groups were as well.
1,5689,1552,5579,Could we ask that a &#039;fringe meeting&#039; is convened at the ACPO Youth Conference later this week to take this forward?
1,5690,1561,5605,Senior members of each agency need to be made aware of the need, ie are they aware that there is no common language
1,5691,1574,5630,Fully endorse this, training is talked about as the cure all but can only ever be seen as providing support to acievcew standards of performance in the workplace - we should change our culture to encourage effective supervison and guiding goes on at work againstg proper, robust and meaningful standards.
1,5692,1549,5630,We can embed the common core and the leadership competences into all police training but it needs to be supported by clear prioritising of risk assesment
1,5693,1557,5574,Barriers? Involvement of relevant agencies with all faiths and cultural groups long before crises arise is likely to lessen the so called &#039;barriers&#039; to communication.
1,5694,1546,5628,This does form the basis for the planned training of first reponders in the future.
1,5695,1564,5681,I agree entirely
1,5696,1561,5592,I think it is fear of lossing your job
1,5697,1545,5579,Clarity from government on the &#039;duty to comply&#039;. Who is included and to what level.
1,5698,1544,5575,Its always good to talk, but I think the agenda was a little ambitious for one day and was a little Police orientated.
1,5699,1566,5617,Does this mean that you are confident that Climbie won&#039;t happen again?
1,5700,1562,5578,This event has raised expectations that something will be developed, we need to meet these expectations
1,5701,1558,5578,1) Sharing of best practice - need to look at how other areas/regions have overcome problems to work in multi-agency settings.
1,5702,1546,5661,Not if it becomes a beauracrattic nightmare
1,5703,1550,5684,I am
1,5704,1547,5575,I would agree with some of the previous points, about how the Police are going to respond to the expectations of ECM re the five outcomes. Today demonstrates how difficult it is to step back from child protection to think more widely about childrens&#039; needs. In my experience this is a shared problem across all public services involved with children.
1,5705,1561,5635,agree
1,5706,1565,5579,Start from the absolutes - the requirements in law, Children Act 2004 and previous.<br />Duty under the law for C&amp;YP &#039;wellbeing&#039; and &#039;welfare&#039;. NOW THESE AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO JOINT TRAIN.<br />Don&#039;t start the training with covering old ground e.g. you must share personal information to prevent harm.<br />After training there should be rigorous follow up to find out if agencies come together to share their knowledge to prevent harm.<br />Each time harm occurs question should be asked, what could be done better.<br />Follow the problem solving methodology;<br />Scan all information, analysis by all responsible agencies together, Action and assessment.<br />If we were building cars on a production line rather than allowing children to develop to reach their potential we could get there. It would not be acceptable for those further up the line to work in isolation unable to talk about the care taken in making a good car.
1,5707,1545,5593,Would we have been able to complete the form?
1,5708,1554,5579,Why are the DfES sponsoring conflicting legislation? Schools are the only agency not required to participate in ECM. Proposed legislation will give greater autonomy to schools and drive them further away from the whole ethos of working together. It is time that DfES gave clear and consistent messages to all and directed that schools participate fully in joint traing, discussion, conferences, etc. or at least enabled them to do so by provision of teaching cover.
1,5709,1568,5573,Youth Offending Services.  They are now doing pre assessments to the final warning process, and do post warning intervention work.  Some of the issues raised today may be the underlying reason for offending behaviour.
1,5710,1574,5681,hear hear
1,5711,1557,5574,Multi agency working would benefit by  involvent at strategic level of representaiives from diverse groups
1,5712,1562,5578,Why not have a multi agency training and development team to help the police service?
1,5713,1561,5573,Who pays, who champions
1,5714,1566,5698,I agree wholeheartedly
1,5715,1548,5583,This is a highly desirable common tool that must be taken into action within the police service.  However, it is not without its difficulties with regard to the resources needed to input the information and that needs to be urgently considered.  I understand that a pece of research in the MetPol identifierd that they would need some 90  additional officers to deal with the bureaucracy associated with the tool.  Multiplies across the country the resource considerations are considerable.  However we cannot overlook the clear advantage that sucha  toool brings with it in terms of interagency knowledge and action planning.  If it prevents the life of a child being lost then how can it not be used?
1,5716,1563,5573,Need to involve inspctorate bodies.  Checking on delivery is a key part of this agenda.
1,5717,1555,5579,The different agencies and bodies are moving at various paces through this process we must ensure that we are investigating every avenue when it comes to training the workforce to do so without thorough consideration could be costly and frustrating for staff members.  Lets try and align the work between agencies
1,5718,1554,5588,In 66% of cases requiring CAF the police are likely to be the originating agency and the first to identify sufficient risk.
1,5719,1568,5689,In the bar Wednesday over a few pints of guiness!!!
1,5720,1562,5579,The least we can do is sign post police officers to relevant information
1,5721,1564,5633,Certainly.  In the Met we don&#039;t believe police officers are an appropriate agency to conduct CAF assessments.  We intend restricting our activity to applying the pre-CAF checklist and routing CAF requests through local CAF coordinators.
1,5722,1561,5575,this course is a micro reflection of what happens in the &#039;arena&#039; ~ those in authority need to experience joint working and not just assume it works # this course will provide a safe envirnment to do this
1,5723,1562,5579,We need to extend the discussions to individual police forces
1,5724,1574,5712,Wow!! That would be agreat idea.
1,5725,1545,5600,The CAF is not a tool to assist Social Care it is there to assess what action or not is needed for that child and to decide if Social Services should even be a lead agency. This is not just about child protection, we need to catch vulnerable children and young people before they becomme at risk of many things, ASB, Crimnality etc.
1,5726,1557,5669,Human rights - nonsense ? Worrying!
1,5727,1547,5572,&#039;Working Together  requires information sharing and the most recent version tackles the conflicts faced by individual gps regarding GMC advice on confidentiality. There may need to be firmer advice if HAs and Trusts are now advising medical employees with insurance claims in mind.
1,5728,1573,5693,yes this may lessen barriers but barriers will exist and will cuase misunderstanding in the communication circuit.  It would be impracticable to learn the idiosynchristies of all the diverse cultures in our society
1,5729,1564,5575,The &#039;taster&#039; didn&#039;t work
1,5730,1561,5715,there is no evidence that it will save a child

1,5806,1685,5799,I agree. At Sharm the FCO worked from the same office.  We were able to sort problems out very quickly.  No phones or faxes, just straight talk.
1,5807,1650,5802,In force liaison with FCO absolutely essential, prevents misinformation between the two agencies

1,5813,1666,5809,FLO&#039;s did an excellent job of re-building trust with the family
1,5814,1675,5803,contacting flc/flo directly rather than via incident room for onwards transmission
1,5815,1650,5803,The gathering of initial, accurate, next of kin information by the casualty bureau for the FLC essential for the FLC to do their job.  Would appreciate some feedback on the quality of information gathered from casualty bureau
1,5816,1646,5809,due to being deployed outside SIO/SIM strategy-no directive briefing consequently - loss and delay in information capture.
1,5817,1671,5803,FCO had trained staff from embassy, RDT, Red Cross and SoS medical personnel.  Whilst tghere was an agred need to deploy FLOs to familis in the UK, FLOs were not required on the ground as AM data collection should have been managed by DVI investigators.
1,5818,1675,5797,excellent job by mortuary teams
1,5819,1620,5802,Was the FCO&#039;s decision a good one in sending the families to Egypt,as this impeded the FLO&#039;s who were deployed as lots of times they went to empty homes. This put greater pressure on the team in Egypt as they then had to collect ante mortem data required
1,5820,1648,5797,None DVI trained officers deployed to mortuary whilst there was a trained DVI team still on standby in UK. Why?
1,5821,1661,5803,PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE FLO ON HIS LONESOME DEPLOYED IN SHARM- DESPITE REPEATED REQUESTS FOR HELP
1,5822,1686,5817,flo&#039;s were needed in sharm as families were either there or travelling.
1,5823,1646,5732,crucial to capture ante-mortem prior to leaving UK
1,5824,1667,5803,and even he was quite inexperienced
1,5825,1650,5800,Accurate information from the scene of the incident critical the early initiation of the casualty bureau, from this call gradings and briefing for call takers can be produced and lines can be opened
1,5826,1674,5821,this particular flo drove everyone mad!
1,5827,1648,5821,Bidders, you performed perfectly.
1,5828,1638,5803,why was the decision not to deploy further FLO&#039;s made by somebody who was not on the ground and had no concept of events unfolding
1,5829,1673,5803,but very good looking!
1,5830,1655,5821,now now children
1,5831,1646,5803,Full understanding of Roles and rsponsibilities....RDT-DVI (scoping team)
1,5832,1666,5803,Families were having direct contact from Egypt - incident room and UK FLO&#039;s unaware of this
1,5833,1685,5820,Yes i agree.  DVI is not for everyone.  You offer to do the job or not.  Non-DVI officers should not have been made or forced to due that job.  Where there is blame the is a big old claim!!
1,5834,1653,5817,It will become increasingly the norm that families start travelling out to the scene - the need to capture the AM info and samples is paramount.  Future deployment should cater for this influx
1,5835,1671,5803,The decision not to deploy FLOs was jointly agreed by FCO and West-Mids GOLD commander.
1,5836,1650,5796,FCO picking up the press strategy was a good move, it meant that we were able to get on with the job in hand without having to appear for press conferences and produced never ending sets of figures
1,5837,1674,5797,there were 9 bags of body parts at the international sharm hospital, not 2.
1,5838,1651,5803,Were requests for further FLO&#039;s routed through Gold Command?
1,5839,1675,5802,great having FCO on hand to question left incident room to early
1,5840,1685,5837,and those 9 were full, not just one body either.
1,5841,1648,5833,You may have to retire early due to stress!
1,5842,1620,5799,it would be benifical to ID a coroners at earliest oppurtunity, to help with DVI issues in Eygpt and the subsequent Coronial issues.
1,5843,1663,5825,poor recording, insufficent details in the initial  stages caused difficulites in tracing / identification or elimination of individuals
1,5844,1661,5824,experienced !! actually
1,5845,1652,5832,The family&#039;s were giving us information that we were not aware of, this was coming back from family members in Egypt
1,5846,1648,5797,&#039;The Bear&#039; was worth his weight in gold! (and thats a lot)
1,5847,1675,5794,whatever the issues raised today we did a good job with no outstanding mispers
1,5848,1666,5843,How can this be resolved?
1,5849,1650,5808,Appointment of SIM by West Mids slow to happen, made establishing casualty bureau operating protocol difficult to progress and delayed an early activation
1,5850,1669,5800,The meeting of flights was sporadic towards the end.Better communication was needed with the airlines and airport units.
1,5851,1646,6064,Strategic chain of command is crucial to successful operation.
1,5852,1660,5845,One family member is related to someone in the FCO
1,5853,1646,5823,DVI capture at point of departure-gatwick,heathrow etc....<br />To allow RDT to meet family needs in Egypt (pastoral care)
1,5854,1651,5799,Coroners society should be involved in planning for DVI and not be event led.
1,5855,1628,5847,lets hearabout these succeses
1,5856,1651,5796,ACPO press office aware of need for generic press statement for all mass fatality incidents
1,5857,1650,5808,Activating mutual aid (national) call support proved to be time consuming.  Due to several factors...many on leave after Operation Theseus...no established force contacts (nationally) for casualty bureau...PNICC does not have the resilience or the expertise to pick up the process of mutual aid nationally
1,5858,1620,5847,fully agree.All grade 1&#039;s had FLO&#039;s deployed as soon as. This was completed in a relatively short time during extremely confusing and conflicting times.
1,5859,1671,5802,FCO did not &quot;send&quot; families to Sharm.  Families made up their own minds.  Nonethelesss, FCO should have ensured family travel plans were notified to NIR as soon as known.
1,5860,1674,5838,three to four flos should have been sent within 24 hrs of the incidents, irrespective of the politics involved.
1,5861,1666,5847,Correct and we must remember it was a learning curve for everybody
2,5862,0,0,Victim property
1,5863,1651,5856,generic holding statement to reduce pressure from media for identifications
1,5864,1685,5836,The FCO were releasing the fact that bodies had been Id&#039;d.  They were not.  FCO is Sharm were not  consulting with the SIM but listening to talk in the office and making incorrect assumptions.  Checks need to be put in place to agree when to release news.
1,5865,1663,5801,agree whole heartedly experienced &amp; knowledgable FCO in NIR gave quick decisions, and support in identification issues
1,5866,1661,5803,the 7 families who came out to eygpt were full of praise of their flos in the uk. They were well looked after in Eygpt, and appeciated our efforts,compassion , and honesty.
1,5867,1648,5803,Did Hannah survive??
1,5868,1675,5799,did SIM face any obstacles as a woman in a Muslim country to requests etc
2,5869,0,0,Tensions
1,5870,1671,5824,What happened to the 1,000 officers who were deployed at one stage or another to Thailnd for Op Bracknell?  Why (apart rom one) were none available for Rock?
1,5871,1650,5867,Sadly she died about two weeks after the incident in the UK
1,5872,1686,5732,DVI team needed to be deployed earlier, so non DVI staff need to be involved in DVI work.  Also DVI staff should not have contact with families.
1,5873,1666,5802,Again great to have FCO within the incident room however the representative in London did not liaise with the FCO in the incident room and wanted to speak to families and FLO&#039;s direct, bypassing the FCO and incident room
1,5874,1663,5867,listen up .....you were told in the presentation
1,5875,1672,5862,some of the exhibit labels on the cases/bags belonging to the victims were unclear and lacking in information relevant to the Holmes system
1,5876,1663,5897,but no beer tokens
1,5877,1655,5935,Make that the bar and I&#039;m up for it
1,5878,1657,5803,the families appeared to be aware of many unfolding issues in Egypt before the flo were informed and it became difficult to pass this information to the families as they already knew more than we did.
1,5879,1620,5859,Perhaps send was not the right word to use,my impression was that the FCO helped fund and &quot;get&quot; the family out to Egypt and but glad you agree that NIR should have been told asap.
1,5880,1685,5869,Red Cross were present in Sharm and were the first to suggest activities to bond the team who had been working flat out for several days.  This needs to be monitored for the NEXT time. I was great at water polo.
1,5881,1686,5870,We were available but did not get deployed straight away, then travelled wih less than 24hrs notice
1,5882,1671,5860,Not politics, it&#039;s best use or resources (and the taxpayer&#039;s money).
1,5883,1675,5862,Great difficulty trying to trace property from Egypt lost in the FCO mail system caused great anxiety with families/non victims
1,5884,1655,5794,I think you are all great and did a super job despite all the politics and red tape involved. Well done :-)
1,5885,1636,5865,The presence of the FCO staff within the NIR was invaluable and enabled staff to see the incident from a different persepctive
1,5886,1651,5802,What was the availability of interpretors? Are they part of FCO rapid deployment? Should they be part of UK DVI team?
1,5887,1650,5848,West Mids did not take the calls in the initial stages of the incident, this was done remotely by national mutual aid.  Unless a standard ACPO ratified training package is produced we will always get quality issues from forces whose casualty bureaux are not as experienced or well used as our own
1,5888,1675,5803,FLA (******** name removed to preserve debrief integrity) is a lightweight and wont buy a drink
1,5889,1661,5814,SORRY!! But there was the odd occasion when the flo in the uk needed to know something to pass on to the rest of the famiy- ie the BRACCI and Ayers family, when we confirmed we had found them.
1,5890,1663,5797,what criteria was used to make visial initial assessment that a body was a british national? which would then allow UK team access to same for DNA etc... was this done purely on skin tone?
1,5891,1636,5811,I agree - there was a degree of confusion as to who was performing what role. WMP are very short of SIM trained staff and as a result struggled to understand the issues and concepts of this area of work
1,5892,1678,5796,The media cover was helpful initially as information was quite slow coming through
1,5893,1667,5862,some of the fco&#039;s have no idea about evidential trails and continuity, which whilst understandable, is very frustrating and time consuming for those who have to then chase up statements and correct the mistakes etc    i think is potentially a training issue for the fco&#039;s....
1,5894,1669,5799,The SIO worked extremely hard,was he supported enough?
1,5895,1671,5804,We did well to get it down to only 2 lists. On Bracknell there were at least 5!  Nonetheless the FCO learned and for Op Dimension USA hurricanes) there is only one list, &quot;owned by NIR @ GMP).
1,5896,1653,5796,Making use of BCU media officers assisted with the liaison between the families and the FCO if they wanted to engage with the media.
1,5897,1666,5803,Very grateful for Graham LAWRENCE to be deployed to the incident room and provide us with expert knowledge re family liaison and assist us with the writing of the FLO strategy.
1,5898,1667,5824,and he cant hold his liquor
1,5899,1661,5815,some flo&#039;s were not aware that there is a national dental records office in eastbourne which has a data base of nhs patients, but does not include if they receive private treatment.
1,5900,1655,5894,Yes he was supplied with tea and biscuits on an hourly basis
1,5901,1678,5800,the IT issues caused problems with the individual forces
1,5902,1660,5803,There was difficulty in keeping my family updated with critcal as information being sent by E mail was not being received by me for up to two days.
1,5903,1636,5870,Rock suffered as a result of Bracknell - there was a reluctance to deploy staff overseas when the RDT role was supposed to cover many of the functions that the police FLOs could provide. The FLO strateg was focused on avoiding multiple deployments to the same family hence a reluctance to send staff overseas as FLOs
1,5904,1638,5795,Could some thought be given to helping third world countries that are in the terrorist spotlight  and where Uk nationals flock in large numbers  making them likely targets,<br />to teach them scene management
1,5905,1650,5854,Coroners society have been aware of this issue for several years.  There is the expertise within the society to formulate their own emergency plans but it would appear no-one wishes to get going and make it happen
1,5906,1652,5897,shame he can&#039;t book a hotel
1,5907,1675,5796,All Police press need to be aware of what they release regarding families and should at least run it past their FLOs
1,5908,1666,5894,I think a Deputy should have been introduced earlier to ease the pressures the SIO was under
1,5909,1657,5803,it was difficult to inform the families what had actually happened in Egypt as flo was unaware and families were being told by all sorts of means. throughout this incident there has been an undercurrent of information passed to the families by media and other victims families
1,5910,1685,5886,The interps were very good out there, well execpt for not picking up on local customs that almost got arrested.  Other than that they were tops.  One came out drinking drinking with us.
1,5911,1655,5893,To be fair some police officers struggle with this!!!!!
1,5912,1661,5803,the rdt were great at sorting out the admin picking upcollecting from the airport, hotel accomodation etc.<br />BUT they cannot fill in the dvi forms, go with family to view the body in the mortuary(we had to pinch sheets from the hotel to cover up the body as best as we could)<br />etc etc<br />Next time - get the fco to work closely wth the flos and have a daily briefing with the flo
1,5913,1667,5890,most of the body parts were too badly decomposed to be able to make any vu=isual assessment at all, they really were a complete mess
1,5914,1636,5860,The decision not to deploy more FLOs was made by the Police Gold commander and the FCO Gold owing to the functions of the RDT team in respect of the provision of short term FLO care
1,5915,1638,5890,This could not be done on skin tone as in the case of Chas jayawardena for instance  it was done on a combination of factors including hearsay evidence of where the person was mode of dress tattoes marks scars etc
1,5916,1670,5803,Very confused about need for FLOs in Egypt<br />- had to train 2  DVI staff in SeS to take DVI from family???<br />- surely there was only a need to complete DVI forms and familial swab?<br />- there were DVI staff there to take DVI from family and RDT staff to deal with pastoral family matters<br />- the decision not to send FLOs was a joint FCO and WMP Gold decision.
1,5917,1679,5868,not really,  i did have concerns that it may be a problem,  I think the issued were more around our lack of knowledge of local procedures
1,5918,1636,5884,I agree - the team acomplished a tremendous amount in a very short time. The Operation was a real sucess and a credit to all those involved.
1,5919,1674,5862,Property from victims rooms,ie, ayers/bracci were just thrown into one or two suitcases so it was difficult to establish ownership. Continuity of property was a major problem in Egypt - fco staff attending the Ghazala did not always establish who passed on the property to them and we had no statements evidencing continuity.
1,5920,1686,5890,Samples were taken from every possible body part, dependent on the level of decomposition.
1,5921,1636,5872,Agree - there is a lot of misunderstanding in relation to DVI and the different functions within it. A national DVI cadre should be established that ensures suitably trained staff are deployed in sufficient numbers as quickly as possible.
1,5922,1679,5817,how big do you think our team was,  DVI mortuary teams should not have direct contact with family members,  how can they deal with the emotions of the families then go and sort out the body parts?<br />I agree that DVI training could be stretched to cover the diverse roles but family emotions must be kept separate,  its not nice working in the mortuaries and dealing with deal,  its easier to cope with if you can remain detached from the emotional side
1,5923,1620,5889,I understand that under certain circumstances direct contact with the FLO will be quicker if coming from those in Egypt,but the NIR still needed to know the content of the conversations.
1,5924,1685,5918,Stop I&#039;m feeling sick now.  T
1,5925,1679,5832,Unfortunately some of the families kept in contact with each other and it was difficult to manage the information flow.  Where we were aware of the potential for information to be passed inter family we tried to manage this by arranging simultaenous meetings
1,5926,1686,5794,Andy and Don need some sort of award for their efforts.
1,5927,1620,5889,The FLC&#039;s who manage the FLO&#039;s need to appreciate that in these incidents the FLO have to gain all the Ante-Mortem data as soon as,this was hampered by the FLO&#039;s having to still complete their normal day job and completing this work later!!!
1,5928,1653,5914,I appreciate the &#039;care&#039; of the families is one issue, but there was a great deal of pressure to get AM details and a number of our families were out in Egypt.  If it is considered that the collection of AM details (DVI), exhibits and life style statements is a police role, then they need to be out there - the care of the families can be then carried out with their RDT colleagues.
1,5929,1675,5959,The FCO teams need an imput regarding exhibits to assist the RDT/DVI teams when next deployed
1,5930,1679,5794,We put ourselves under a lot of pressure as we were working long hours everything seemed to take a long time to achieve.  The reality is we arrived on the Monday tea time,  by the Friday we had found all seven of our bodies and just needed to formally identify them.
1,5931,1678,5794,My family were full of praise for the team out in Egypt.
1,5932,1685,5915,Chas was thought by the locals to be a local at first.  His tattoos were the best initial ID factor.  His final skin colour was bright red.
1,5933,1655,5794,I managed to get a parking space in Lloyd House Car park!!!
1,5934,1679,5794,Fantastic support from FSS DNA results were delivered on time enabling the ethical confirmation of all the identifications and the identification of 93 out of 96 body parts
1,5935,1648,5794,Perhaps we should all have a &#039;team hug&#039; in the car park.
1,5936,1666,5902,Hopefully West Mids e-mail system will improve when we transfer to Outlook in the near future.  We did have problems with Force &#039;Firewalls&#039;.  E-mail was good as it was auditable, anything urgent we sent e-mails and made telephone contact
1,5937,1678,5933,We didn&#039;t!!!
1,5938,1679,5795,The initial response was excellent.Casualty bureau was established and A DVI team was ready to deploy within 12 hours however they were stood down and their deployment was delayed by two days, Im not sure however that this caused any serious delay in the identifcation and repatriation process
1,5939,1686,5732,Dvi equipment needs to be flown over rather than a 4 man team humping 180 kilos of excess baggage during a 24hr journey.
1,5940,1675,5797,what is going to happen with the remaining unidentified body parts
1,5941,1665,5911,whats an exhibit label
1,5942,1638,5847,On arrival at shaarm we had to beg borrow steal equipment but when contacting west midlands for re-supply this was done quickly and efficiently thanks
1,5943,1655,5794,Don managed a full complete sentence without swearing. An achievement in itself!
1,5944,1620,5803,All flo&#039;s deployed in these types of critical incidents need to be protected if thats the right word to use. The flos&#039;s had to get the Ante-Mortem data asap,as this helped id the bodies.However I was only too aware that flo&#039;s were being made to complete this task was doing their normal day job.
1,5945,1672,5794,This Operation was a success even with the limited staff.  This was down to old fashioned policing and hard work.
1,5946,1620,5803,Did the flo&#039;s feel they were given enough info from the flc&#039;s to brief their families?
1,5947,1653,5732,I am conscious of the fact that this was not a UK investigation, but this is the first time I have been officially told what is believed to have happened at the scene.  Could consideration be given to supplying a daily briefing in the first week or two?  Things were muddled, but the FLO&#039;s were constantly being asked what happened, is it true that such and such happened? Some guidance on what info was known (beyond a media perspective) would have been helpful.
1,5948,1685,5916,FLO&#039;s in Egypt?  Of course they were needed.  There will always be families who will fly out to search for themselves, look at the situation in India now and Pakistan.  You cannot have those who process the bodies meeting with the family - it will blow a fuse.  Next time can we have one with a voice not so high and who can drink???
1,5949,1678,5814,But we always enjoyed his calls!
1,5950,1685,5862,Anything from the Icecream box anyone???
1,5951,1650,5937,You have to be out of bed early to beat casualty bureau operators to car parking spaces...
1,5952,1655,5941,Versace and D &amp; C me thinks!
1,5953,1669,5869,WMP need to keep a store of supplies ready for any future deployment.
1,5954,1686,5947,Getting info from egyptian authorities was like platting fog.
1,5955,1638,5835,agreed however the SIM was the person on the ground who should have been listened to
1,5956,1675,5959,continuity is vital as had this incident been on UK soil there would have been massive continuity and therefore disclosure issues had offenders been arrested.Some Police officers had not timed or dated seizure or movement of exhibits in UK/Egypt which then cannot be updated via Holmes 2 system
1,5957,1652,5933,It was an issue when delivering or collecting property.<br />Could it be possible for a space to be reserved in future when an FLO has given a<br />approximate arrival time
1,5958,1660,5946,Yes but I was still informed of the remains being identified by my family,( and when the remains were being returned.)
2,5959,0,0,Exhibits
1,5960,1667,5943,Don was tremendous when it came down to knowledge of expenses...we renamed him &quot;arthur&quot; (skargill)
1,5961,1669,5869,Staff need to be deployed to UK airports that have flights to the effected area asap to capture DNA of any families going to find relatives,prior to them leaving.
1,5962,1666,5947,This was not an investigation in the Police sense we all know.  Our role was to identify and repatriate bodies.  I totally agree that FLO&#039;s need to be updated with correct information and as soon as possible.  A lot of what you are being told today is as a result of all statements being read (there were well over 100 witnesses to this incident) this takes time.
1,5963,1663,5894,deputy was very sucessful addittion who undertook the logistical &amp; personnel issues most diligently
1,5964,1661,5916,ask the familys in sharm if they  found the flo useful!<br />the rdt team are not cops- and were gratefulfor the info from the flo about body repat, interim death certs, property returns, the visit to the mortuary with the flo.<br />you need a flo to do all this- bear in mind 1 mortuary was 2 hr drive away<br />the dvi team- this consisted of 2 cops untrained<br />7 families came out to sharm
1,5965,1648,5874,I cant listen, type and think of my next meal all at the same time.
1,5966,1666,5958,This highlights the need to strictly adhere to the flow of information from Egypt to the Incident Room in order for the MIR to be the central hub which contains all information to be disseminated.
2,5967,0,0,Welfare
1,5968,1685,5732,BA allowed that 180kg&#039;s to &quot;slip&quot; into the hold at no charge.  That didn&#039;t happen on the Sharm side.  We got charged for the extra weight.  It&#039;s a good job that a credit card was on hand.  GO bags are an absolute must for the next time.  Store them at airports (or better still each consulate) and regular checks on the use by dates.
1,5969,1655,5732,All survivors were given a pre-typed form to complete upon returning to the UK, it is understoog that it was produed by the Travel Companies. This needs to be re written and an appropriate list of questions agreed as some of the questions were mis-leading
1,5970,1663,5868,selection of SIM would be worthy of more appropriate selection criteria, based on location / traditions of local community, with due consideration to military based rank structure in such countries, in order to gain effective &amp; speedy interaction with local authorities
1,5971,1667,5967,the snorkelling was fantastic
1,5972,1663,5794,regardless of inexperience in this field of work, rank &amp; interforce / agency issues, the british police &amp; respective government agencies worked together to achieve a professional result
1,5973,1671,5946,Continuing complaints from families that they know nothing about the &quot;assistance package&quot;.<br />Is this because UK FLOs were not informed or didn&#039;t get the message?<br />Or was it because the families were either given too many different items of  information or because the information was not repeated often enough?<br />And was the information passed only orally, or were written details left with the families?<br />Finally, why do some families tell FCO that FLOs have exited (when the understanding is  that they will not be withdrawn until after the Inquest).
2,5974,0,0,Family expectations during and now
1,5975,1620,5957,I think this is a valid point,but alas we have very limited parking at Lloyd house.For those who work there 24/7 its a first come first serve basis!!
1,5976,1650,5800,Despite the fact that the Casualty Bureau trained 25 MIU receivers to work in the Casualty bureau we were allocated an untrained, relatively inexperienced receiver.  We were fortunate that they had support initially from an experienced MIU trainer who had knowledge of casulaty bureau.  This is a heavy burden for an untrained CB receiver, however, everyone in CB cannot speak highly enough of Mary who had a tough job, worked long hours and is now the expert Force CB receiver/
1,5977,1659,5973,What assistance package.
1,5978,1638,5869,The cultural issues between the Chief prosecutor and the team was something that needed very careful handling this did result in tension at times however the skillful handling of this by Mr  Yousef FAOUD,Rasha MEYER Hannah and Ahmed the driver paid dividends and they should be thanked officially
1,5979,1650,5901,Which IT issues are those?  How can we overcome them?
1,5980,1666,5946,All FLO&#039;s and Force FLC&#039;s were made aware of the after care package at the beginning of the enquiry.
1,5981,1661,5803,the flo in eygpt sholud have had a daily briefing with the flo coordinator back in the uk.<br />what about faxing the flo logs too back to the uk- if poss this would be a good idea - if the flo had written them up!
1,5982,1685,5971,The Scuba diving was.  Remember how the Red Cross lady was the only/first person who was concerned about the long hours and lack of &#039;play time&#039; we had.  She sorted a water polo session that really smashed the ice.  Warning for the next time that stress breaks must be added.
1,5983,1663,5848,attention to detail, ensuring that simple details i.e contact numbers for family &amp; addresses are gleened so that o/s force can be direct to the address, when we continually get no reply to landline numbers, also next of kin / parents addresses
1,5984,1641,5803,Our family were aware that their plane home from Egypt carried bodies, as they had seen them being loaded. Not nice.
1,5985,1667,5982,and i was good at that water polo....
1,5986,1652,5973,my understanding was we were told to exit
1,5987,1661,5797,these officers, in particular andy cobby and don did a fantastic job in the most horrendous conditions.<br />The puddings did well too!!
1,5988,1663,5825,incidents arouse whereby when callers were re contacted by NIR it was established that groups of families were outstanding, rather than just one individual which has major implications to accurate numbers of mispers, and outstanding casualties
1,5989,1648,5987,If I hear the word &#039;pudding&#039; again, Im going to rage up!
1,5990,1686,5978,So do the ex-pat divers who attended the hospital to treat victims, and some of the reps/tour companies for their efforts.  likewise the lack of effort from one tour company for doing nothing!!
1,5991,1666,5981,I agree with this valid point, as the SIO and SIM had a daily morning conference call, the FLO and FLC&#039;s should have also done this and all issues addressed in the daily briefing sent out to all FLO&#039;s and FLC&#039;s.
1,5992,1667,5989,pudding...pudding....pudding ...  :)
1,5993,1675,5869,All Forces need to be battle ready for next deployment regarding supplies,remember it could be You.
1,5994,1685,5987,I&#039;ll open the car boot, you start the engine.  Shortstop is coming home to Gods country.
1,5995,1659,5974,Family members wanted to attend the airport to be present for the arrival of the aircraft but when enquiries were made there were no facilities in place and they were openly dissuade by the coroner. Why was this
2,5996,0,0,Briefing
1,5997,1688,5732,In the final analysis of the operation, will those who were involved receive a copy of the report, or is this the last we will hear of it??
1,5998,1653,5974,Some of the expectations of families could not be met.  For example giving the family an information pack on their return to UK - this turned out to be the Homicide Pack and is not really suitable for incidents abroad.  May be we need to have such a &#039;pack&#039; which is generic enough to fit a multitude of incidents?  Bit difficult I know!
1,5999,1648,5967,Have any official &#039;thankyou&#039; letters been sent to people like airline staff, egypt drivers, etc?
1,6000,1675,5974,some of the body parts of family members were so small that they were placed in the same coffin.The thinking was that the families would have even more distressed if they saw one coffin containing2/3 persons being unloaded
1,6001,1666,5996,This briefing tool is an excellent idea, giving people the chance to raise issues and actually have their issues answered in minutes.
1,6002,1663,5869,poor distrubution of workload &amp; deployment of staff in egypt caused unnecessary frustrations
1,6003,1675,5803,The FLOs when deployed to an operation should be seconded until completion not doing nightshift other duties as it is a hard enough job as it is.If home forces cannot agree this dont deploy
1,6004,1651,5802,ACPO Manual Of Guidance demands FLO&#039;s for all Fatacs. Investigating officers are kept separate. Not relevant but point needed to be made in light of comment.
1,6005,1663,5869,why does SIM believe DC&#039;s were required in preference to PC traffic officer, who deal with fatals &amp; families on a more regular basis than DC&#039;s
1,6006,1675,5996,You have all done very well
1,6007,1655,5979,Fax not able to send international faxes. No TV in CB to monitor news. E mail problems. Not enough computer terminals for non CB staff to have access to.
1,6008,1641,6003,Seconded!!!! I was called by my Sgt to tell me they had a prisoner waiting in custody for me.... I was somewhat busy completing DVI forms/lifestyle statements/trying to collect DNA. Etc.
1,6009,1655,6005,Good point..its the same course,
1,6010,1667,5994,pudding....
1,6011,1675,6008,This is exactly what i am talking about
1,6012,1663,5894,He dealt with frustrations very diplomatically...he could have been better supported rather than dictated too
1,6013,1650,5997,A copy of this debrief would be welcome, along with an action plan for each depatment please
2,6014,0,0,What specially trained specialists do we, need training implications?
1,6015,1652,6003,I was accused by my division for taking the p--s because I worked rest days and hired a car and only calmed down when they were given a code to claim it back
1,6016,1675,6008,Shouldnt the FLCs manage this
1,6017,1655,5794,A number of survivors statements were required from people living within the Met. The requests were made from the West Mids and despite the fact they were stretched after the bombings all Stmts were obtained swiftly. Great team work and dedication
1,6018,1659,5802,Most Flos are experienced investigators, and are able to assist in other enquiries. Surely it is up to the Senior Investigator to assess the situation and request staff as required and not be second guessed.
1,6019,1663,5883,as per the DNA samples may be it would have been more appropriate to escort the property back when egypt deployed staff were returing ...putting them on the same flight would have been a suitable solution
1,6020,1667,5950,i havent heard anything from it....i keep calling but it never replies...
1,6021,1655,5803,A policy decision should be made regarding FLO officers to visit survivors who may not have lost family members but have lost close friends and have witnessed the incident
1,6022,1685,5997,I&#039;d like copy of please too.
1,6023,1650,6014,&#039;UK policing&#039; needs a national DVI team.  However, forces need to take contingency planning, training and exercising seriously.  At the moment it is not a KPI, (will be soon) or it is just not &#039;sexy&#039; enough we need to ensure that we equip our officers with the basic knowledge, skills and kit.  This also needs to be fed up through to ACPO ranks
1,6024,1675,6014,We as a Police Service need to have trained teams ready for rapid deployment now in each Force,Not the usual police jargon its in the pipeline
1,6025,1653,6014,Consideration of role of FLO and DVI.  Should this be a seperate function?  With the advent of strategic forces we have an opportunity to work out how we can best respond in the future to these disasters.
1,6026,1659,5802,Traffic Officers who deal with Fatacs  are usually supported by Family Contact Officers as it was recognised nationally that from a stress and wefare side the officer dealing should not be in contact with the victims family. This is not a new concept
1,6027,1641,6005,I&#039;m a shift PC and a FLO. The two can be mutually compatable, and I would be offended if anybody felt I was incapable due to my rank. I have completd a FLO course,and have experience dealing with victims and DVI forms. Thank you for reading.
1,6028,1671,5959,Exhibits officer (UK) needs locked store and a fridge.
1,6029,1666,5803,Does a strategy need to be in place as on several occasions the FLO&#039;s in the UK were tasked via actions from the team in Egypt regarding matters that the NIR had no knowledge of.
1,6030,1650,6007,All fax lines and lines into the casualty bureau are now international lines.  Despite repeated requests from CB it required an international incident before it was enabled!  It is established policy not to have live TV in the CB.  Callers to CB can hear it and it may appear unprofessional.  Also CB operators prefer not to be confronted with graphic images of what is happening at the scene whilst they are dealing with distressed callers.  Access to email can be facilitiated on request at any time.
1,6031,1653,6014,Future training - FLO logs should be in an electronic format (similar principle to HOLMES SIO log).  It would mean that there isn&#039;t the security issues of faxing these documents as they can be e-mailed within police secure network.  It would assist me as an FLC to have access to logs for monitoring/supervision purposes and early ID of issues within the family which are documented can be viewed by FCO etc.  It could be searchable as a document and could be sent anywhere in the world quite easily!!
1,6032,1654,5974,my family are wanting an update regarding the memorial service - since they were initially asked if they were interested and their reply was yes - they have not heard anything else from anyone - do we have any further information on this subject?
1,6033,1666,5995,Our understanding was that the families would not be given &#039;airside&#039; access so would not have seen anything.  The bodies were obviously taken straight to the mortuary and as a vast majority of you are aware they were not suitable for viewing.
1,6034,1686,5967,There should be no misunderstanding re the above comments.  Officers worked long hours in extreme heat and unpleasant conditions.  All of us were ill at some stage, and under a great deal of stress, including emotional.
1,6035,1650,6025,The role of FLO in disaster victim identification is just one aspect of the process as are other aspects ie victim recovery, temporary mortuary and casualty bureau.  All contribute, in part, to the overall process.  Forces should ensure that they include in their initial FLO training the DVI tasks (ie interpol forms etc) they expect their FLO&#039;s to undertake
1,6036,1661,6032,when/ where is this memorial service?? can anyone attend??
1,6037,1655,5957,Gold control was issued with 4 spaces....however this was a closely guarded secret and wasn&#039;t used therefore the spaces were taken away
1,6038,1691,5802,Session 2
1,6039,1685,5802,I think it important that the SIM is better supported when dealing there at the scene.  If the SIM asks they should get.  They don&#039;t ask for additional resources just for the hell of it.  By not allowing the extra FLO&#039;s the Egypt team were put under more stress.  Do we not trust the SIM out there?
1,6040,1649,5802,The FCO help with the passport checks re mispers was invaluable.  All the staff provided were friendly and helpful. An asset to the Cas Bureau.
1,6041,1620,6032,This lead by the FCO,steve is best to answer this.
1,6042,1679,6002,all staff in Egypt were working long hours,  the work in the mortuary was particularly difficult and was clearly the hardest of all the roles however I suspect this comment is generated by someone who wasnt there
1,6043,1675,5894,I helped him?
1,6044,1691,6034,Not at all this is a significant reality of the tensions and the need to support officers who are delivering within a high stress environment
1,6045,1650,5895,Fab...that will help CB enormously, thanks
1,6046,1661,6031,Great idea as long as you have access to the net! It was only because one cop took his own lap top with him we had contact with the MIR.
1,6047,1655,6005,I am a DC with many years experience investigating etc.....I know for a fact that I would not make a good FLO and I know that many of my collegues who are not from a CID background are great in this role. SIO&#039;s and SIM&#039;s need to be educated that being a DC is not the be all and end all in an investigation
1,6048,1686,5732,The SIM should make the decision regarding what staff are required.  The SIM should not be contradicted by people in the UK, who can&#039;t possibly understand the issues on scene.
1,6049,1661,5996,Not enough briefings held in eygpt.
1,6050,1646,5929,basic exhibit handling is incorporated in the RDT training-along with continuity and integrity around exhibits.
1,6051,1673,6070,We do not think that we are experts in all areas but if you want us to do a job allow us to get on with it, trust our judgements and decision making processes.
1,6052,1679,6005,The SIM doesnt believe this at all,  I am well aware that Road Deaths are the biggest workload for Family Liaison Officers.  I am also a FLO co-ordinator for West Mercia and whilst my roles of SIM and SIO may occasionally pose difficulties in managing all the different roles,  I rely on FLOs from a variety of backgrounds to support investigations.  Beat Managers particularly make good FLOs and most of the Ante mortem work which came out of the Tsunami and Operation Theseus was done by beat managers
1,6053,1655,5798,One of the major problems in the incident room was the lack of info re the scenes. Some people believedthat ther was only 1 explosion....it was only after speaking to survivors that the scequence of events materialised
1,6054,1649,5800,Casualty Bureau needs to have hooked onto the IT a way of displaying level one mispers with ease of use to the FLC.   With a scrathboard so that messages can be attached re body repatriation times religious issues press interest.  Post Mortem date time. etc
1,6055,1661,5802,what assistance package are you talking about?? i am a flo and am only aware of the homicide package.
1,6056,1636,5802,The FCO assistance package has &quot;not for public distribution&quot; written at the top of it. This caused considerable confusion for the FLOs that impacted on the document&#039;s distribution.
1,6057,1679,5890,The criteria was a comparison of the Ante mortem forms against the post mortem forms,  This required almost microscopic examination of the bodies by the mortuary teams.  Some of the bodies were visibly recognisable.
1,6058,1661,5802,the admin support in sharm was great- but we should have had a briefing from them to tell us what they can help us with on day 1
1,6059,1674,5802,why a briefing - what did you need to know? Crack on.
1,6060,1670,6055,The terrorist support package<br />- funded flights to scene<br />-funded hotel accommodation, etc
1,6061,1666,6055,The After Care package was sent out via e-mail in the early stages of the enquiry to all the FLC&#039;s.
1,6062,1679,5802,The welfare of the families was left to the FCO and a strategy was written around that.   The ante-mortem data has to be gathered quickly as detailed descriptions were required to find the bodies amongst the total dead
1,6063,1636,6021,This was done. Survivors were met and identified as significant witnesses. A policy decision was made that they would be visited by an FLO trained officer to obtain the statement. The FLO was not a &quot;deployment&quot; but an opportunity to offer support in a sensitive manner and advise re support from other agencies.
1,6064,1663,6048,The understanding is that the SIM was to form part of the &#039;team&#039;, working in partnership with Gold Command, who are experienced and have a fuller over view, there to support the SIM not contradict ?
1,6065,1685,5967,In the Tsunami callout I am aware that Occy Health were present and there role was just to monitor and look after the staff.  None went to Sharm.  Is this, like with the FLO, another block made by the FCO and those advising them?  Why didn&#039;t we get one?
1,6066,1679,5802,Trying to find 10 bodies amongst the total number of bodies in three different mortuarties  is a little more difficult
2,6067,0,0,Learning Team FLO
2,6068,0,0,Learning Incident Room Casualty Bureau FCO
2,6069,0,0,Learning Team Eygpt Deployment
1,6070,1650,5802,Think the police do need reminding occasionally that they are not the ultimate experts in all matters esp. deaths overseas.  Thank-you for reminding us.
1,6071,1653,5802,Steve made reference to him going on a training course following this presentation - does the police and FCO have joint training OR are either able to access the others training material?
1,6072,1620,6070,V v v true
1,6073,1661,5802,Noone from the RDT came to the mortuary with any of the families. - in my opinion it should be the flo who does this anyway
1,6074,1678,5802,The FCO in general were very informative but were not very helpful initially when the families were asking for financial help
1,6075,1663,5839,valuable part of the daily briefings
1,6076,1679,5984,Unfortunately we had little choice of aircraft to get the bodies back home.  We were concious of the possibility of this and tried tom avoid loading taking place in public view.
1,6077,1649,5802,Briefings on a daily basis are inportant so that FLOs can update families otherwise you just look at each other!<br />You have got to be able to tell them something about what is going on in the disaster area.
1,6078,1659,6000,There was no expectation to view the coffins/containers, but a need by the family to be there on their return.I believe that this was available to  families involved in Op Bracknell
1,6079,1671,6041,This lead by DCMS - But Steve will ask.
1,6080,1679,6014,There is some considerable confusion around DVI even amongst the experts,  DVI has a number of stands,  body recover,  mortuary and antemortem being crucial parts of DVI.  Currently there is national training around mortuary and body recovery however until now Ante-mortem sits within the ACPO strategy for Family Liaison .  If we are serious about proper DVI training we need to encompass all aspects of the training.  The question is what is a DVI trained team.  There is no such team yet in existence in the UK and there is no model for a DVI team.
1,6081,1684,6067,Greater amount of initial information - as much as possible would help when dealing with family members
1,6082,1692,6068,have a suitable sized ready prepared office for the intellgence cell next to the casualty bureau.
1,6083,1678,6064,FLO briefing sheets were circulated on a daily basis during the early period of the operation. They represented the information that was comming from Sharm and the NIR. The documents were a summary of the daily briefings given to the NIR. There were a number of days when the information from Egypt was very confused and contradictory owing to the state of play on the ground.
1,6084,1684,6067,What information has been out in the media OR provided by official channels?  This again would be useful for FLO&#039;s.
1,6085,1678,6048,The SIM did not have a overall view of what was happening in the UK and works to the Gold group
1,6086,1692,6068,list of core tasks to assist the SIM.  Similiar to Murder Manual.
1,6087,1692,6068,We need an ACPO established and ratified protocol for Casualty Bureau National Mutual Aid.
1,6088,1684,6067,Regular updates about what is happening at the scene - was a sense of isolation from the whole enquiry to some extent.  This was complicated by families being out there and sending back other information to their relatives OR other family members
1,6089,1683,6069,staff required<br />ante mortem<br />mortuary/body recovery<br />local knowledge<br />SIM<br />exhibits<br />investigative capabilities<br />pathologist???<br />soco<br />odentologist???<br />doc manager

1,6094,1692,6068,Computerised white board system.
1,6095,1692,6068,HOLMES 2 trained Exhibits Officer is a minimal requirement.
1,6096,1692,6068,Host Force FLC decision log to be created to act as an audit.
1,6097,1684,6067,If greater use is being made of technology then forces have to set up to provide a system that works, that firewalls do not allow e-mails to sit in a system without any notice that it has not got to its destination.  Consideration of provision of lap tops to allow remote access if FLO&#039;s travel around.
1,6098,1692,6068,Each Force needs a fully trained incident room team and deployment team.  Updated training/exercises regularly.
1,6099,1692,6068,More resillience around FLC role in West Midlands.
1,6100,1692,6068,Website for FLO&#039;s.
1,6101,1692,6068,More resillience around Casualty Bureau Managers role in West Midlands.
1,6102,1684,6067,Need a comprehensive contact list that is can be accessed by all FLO&#039;s giving details of family being dealt with and mobile contact numbers.
1,6103,1692,6068,All Forces to appreciate the seriousness of the incident.
1,6104,1692,6068,Incident Room adequately resourced and continuity of staff.
1,6105,1683,6090,equipment<br />tyrex suits, boots, gloves<br />disinfectant<br />basic surgical equipment<br />swabs<br />containers<br />dna 1 and 2 kits<br />photography equipments<br />pc&#039;s<br />fingerprints documents and pads<br />dvi forms pink and yellows<br />flo logs<br />statement forms<br />message pads<br />body/body part books<br />lighting equipment<br />portable aircon units<br />cool boxes<br />exhibit books<br />exhibit bags and labels<br />tape bio hazard<br />sellotape<br />scissors<br />mobile phones<br />sheets<br />chargers<br />footbaths<br />polythene<br />body bags<br />first aid and medical accessories
1,6106,1684,6067,Standards?  Common policy - would it be possible to set some standards OR is this left to a force to manage this?<br />This created some tension with families who were being dealt with by more than one FLO from different forces
1,6107,1692,6068,More effective communication between UK and Abroad.
1,6108,1684,6067,Structured dissemination of information.  Was a little sporadic at time.
1,6109,1692,6068,Deputy SIO to be identified immediately.
1,6110,1692,6068,Strategical command recognition.
1,6111,1692,6107,Satellite phones, established e-mail links, scanner, faxes etc.
1,6112,1692,6099,More FLC&#039;s to be trained across the Force and activated during multiple fatalities incident.
1,6113,1692,6100,Similar website to the Extranet used by the Met, whereby press releases, forms, briefings etc can be accessed by all Forces.
1,6114,1684,6067,A &#039;drop down&#039; list of information that can be given would be useful.  Then each FLO can clearly indicate on logs OR on some electronic document that it has been done, or reason for delay.  Have all forms available electronically, DVI, consent for release of records, statements, after care package etc. that can be accessed as and when needed.  Stops having to go hunting for them at police stations
1,6115,1692,6096,There is currently no log for FLC&#039;s to note any decisions made.  Force issue.
1,6116,1684,6067,Following on from the above a national FLO police site with access to all of the above would be helpful.
1,6117,1684,6088,The daily updates from Op Theseus was well written and a useful document to keep going back to.
1,6118,1692,6103,Forces need to appreciate that staff need to be seconded solely to the incident room and not be given other tasks/actions.
1,6119,1683,6105,support from senior management:<br />full support including all reasonable requests for staff and equipment to be granted<br />welfare issues to be dealt with<br />consultation between mir and on the ground team<br />mdat to attend scene of disaster

1,6125,1692,6095,HOLMES 2 exhibit system is used to record continuity.  Experienced staff is essential.
1,6126,1684,6108,Eg &#039;after care package&#039; - some first reference to a sum of money being available for counselling.  Found out from FCO direct what this entailed.  But was also other information that came out about flights to the scene which came later, but was also referred to as &#039;after care package&#039;.
1,6127,1684,6088,Requirement for daily updates from the FLO&#039;s at the scene, via the MIR.  This would give the FLO in UK an indication of what is happening with their family out at a scene.
1,6128,1683,6122,we were aware that there was a perception from back in uk that we were there on a holiday which was of course incorrect<br />we feel that we were used as cheap labour<br />from the team, NOT THE SIM -<br />lack of recognition for the SIM including no bonus payment
1,6129,1692,6110,Each Force senior management to fully understand the processes around command structures around dealing with mass fatality.
1,6130,1692,6104,Dedicated team of people trained and experienced.  Team to be seconded to the incident until completion of the investigation.
1,6131,1683,6069,Joint training with FCO RDT
1,6132,1684,6088,FLO logs to be in an electronic format.  This would allow greater access by a number of individuals and means the transmission of information quickly and securely
1,6133,1692,6104,West Midlands Police need SIM&#039;s trained.  Currently have none.
1,6134,1684,6088,Briefings - a personal briefing of personnel deployed on the Operation can be invaluable and a lot of issues can be resolved at the very earliest stages.<br />Conference call facilities should be better employed, with FLC&#039;s at the least being able to contribute to the MIR daily briefing
1,6135,1692,6068,FLCs need an up to date contact list of all trained FLC&#039;s and SPOC&#039;s across the Country.
1,6136,1692,6135,We were using PNICC lists which had not been updated since Bracknell/Theseus and time was wasted trying to identify contacts in other Forces.
1,6137,1692,6068,How does our current Casualty Bureau dovetail with the likes of a dirty bomb in the City Centre.
1,6138,1692,6068,Need a national exhibit label system for continuity purposes.
1,6139,1692,6138,Also need a designated exhibits storage room with fridge, lockable cabinets.
1,6140,1692,6139,And freezer!
1,6141,1683,6105,washing down facilities
1,6142,1683,6105,Perception of where responsibility begins and ends for Police / FCO
1,6143,1692,6137,Casualty Bureau has a fall back at Bournville Lane that can function fully as a stand alone Casualty Bureau or as a split Casualty Bureau with Lloyd House.  HOLMES will shortly be upgraded to HOLMES 2020 when it is anticipated that Casualty Bureau and MIR will be integrated functions on one system.  This will clarify interaction and information flow between MIR/NIR and Casualty Bureau.
1,6144,1684,6088,Management of the information  from the MIR is positive, but FLO&#039;s must be encouraged to liaise with one another on a regular basis, even a 10 day period briefing for example, to make sure they all know what is happening generally and with family members who are being supported by another force.
1,6145,1692,6091,We need a list of kit that will support the DVI process in the mortuary and victim recovery.  These can be stored in the form of readily available &#039;go bags&#039;.  MDAT need to update their list of experts and ensure they have resillience in their current list of experts.

1,6149,1692,6068,Continuing FLO refresher training to pick up issues identified by the FLC through regular deployments and DVI deployments.
1,6150,1620,6081,Totally agree,however this was hampered by the fact that this took place many miles away and that our team in Egypt didnt get out there till some days later.
1,6151,1638,5802,There should be a clear briefing as to what roles and respnsibilities as a police officer we have when working for the FCO as my understanding is that we are merely contractors utilising the skills pertinent to our particular job and on being deployed this has  been a grey area
1,6152,1688,6065,Welfare support was provided in the form of the red cross staff who were deployed with the RDT
1,6153,1620,6102,This incident was unusual as alot of those who perished had  travelled as a family/partners or with friends. Hence there was a lot of overlap within the families from information being given by different FLO&#039;s.
1,6154,1671,6100,And information down loaded, handed in hard copy to families and handing over recorded in FLO log
1,6155,1620,6147,I have value experience in structuring the flo stratergy
1,6156,1652,6147,I recieved the thanks and appreciation of my familys
1,6157,1669,6147,I have shown the ability to quickly grasp new issues and make positive contributions to the effectiveness of the operation.
1,6158,1666,6147,Gave me experience of working closely with the FCO.
1,6159,1620,6147,Gained experience in FLC deployments,got FLO&#039;s into families asap

1,6162,1620,6147,Have understanding re cas bureau and how it works
1,6163,1636,6147,All the deceased were repatriated quickly following ethical identifications following the hard work of a team that was drawn from a large number of forces. This is testement to the professionalism and flexibility of the officers concerned. I am proud to have played a major decision making role within this operation,
1,6164,1673,6147,I was deployed to Eygpt with no knowledge of the DVI process.  Whilst there learnt a number of things both professionally and personally.
1,6165,1666,6147,Gave me experience of working with Forces across the Country and enjoyed working as a &#039;team&#039; with a successful result.
1,6166,1646,6147,Being able to give  a team of experienced dedicated Officers and staff,the confidence to do an excellent job.
1,6167,1672,6147,I demonstrated the ability to work as a team and on my own initiative by liaising effectively with my incident room team, with Interpol and the team in Egypt.
1,6168,1666,6147,Gained experience in writing strategies at a National level.
1,6169,1673,6147,I learnt very quickly to work together in a team with people I had never met before.
1,6170,1645,6147,Having worked on Op Bracknell, was already aware of the DVI Forms, need for obtaining DNA from family, the need to obtain items for latent fingerprints, the need to obtain both medical and dental records ASAP and the fact that these items to be transported to the incident room quickly so that the identification process could be commenced as soon as possible. these included being able to evidence all of the above by means of witness statement.
1,6171,1686,6161,Job satisfaction.
1,6172,1646,6147,Having pride to witness an officer i have trained excel at the role of FLO and at the same time cascade their experience to their partner.(development of best practice)
1,6173,1661,6147,I am an experienced FLO with over 27yrs Police work, mainly as a detective. I have been on a number of murder enqs, as part of the investigation and as a flo.<br />I regard myself as an excellent communicaotr, and am used to working long streessful hours.I felt valued for my work in Eygpt as all the families i dealt with expressed their gratitude.
1,6174,1620,6147,understand importance to id the FLO&#039;s role. So they are used efficiently and undertake the main task,This impinges on the home force so that the flo is only deployed for as long as is needed.
1,6175,1666,6147,Ensured all information received was immediately disseminated in order for families to receive accurate information about their loved ones quickly.
2,6176,0,0,Messages to ACPO
1,6177,1657,6147,Because i have gained valuble experiance that has given me the confidence to deal with a major incident or disaster.when i was initially deployed on Op Rock  i was over whelmed and felt i did not have the experiance to perform this role but with all the help and support of my force, colleagues and wmp i have learnt so much and will not now be phased by completing a DVI form or dealing with any sensitive issues such as body parts and identification procedures.
1,6178,1686,6147,Disappointment that the deployment was viewed as a &#039;jolly&#039;, which devalued the contributions of all concerned.
1,6179,1620,6147,can work under pressure,in difficult situations,with limited correct and confirmed intelligence or facts.
1,6180,1665,6147,i have gained some invaluable experience in communication skills having gained the confidence of a family that had raised concerns over the Police role.<br />I have a greater awareness of the &#039;international&#039; role of the  FLO.
1,6181,1654,6147,gained experience on completing DVI forms - which i feel will be required more and more on future deployments. Interesting working with other FLO&#039;s from around the Country - all dealing with the same &#039;family&#039; but different members of it and dealing with different issues.<br />A good learning deployment as dealt with foreign forces, direct contact with FCO and media.  An all round &#039;learn as you go&#039; deployment which i feel will stand me in good stead for future deployments.
1,6182,1645,6147,Being able to go and speak to our designated family and give them as much information as we were able to and try to be in a position to answer any questions they may have had. Also being able to obtain information from the family which would aid in the indentification process.
1,6183,1646,6147,To witness strategic partnership working at it&#039;s best.
1,6184,1620,6147,unerstand the different roles in the NIR and how each is important to the sucess of the operation.
1,6185,1641,6147,My deployment was at 9pm on a Sunday night. By 10pm I had spoken to three members of the family and arranged a visit , the SIO and FLC in the West Mids, two DI&#039;s in my home force, my Sergeant, sorted out childcare for my two kids and arranged a dog-sitter. if that isn&#039;t resourceful I don&#039;t know what is!
1,6186,1644,6147,The Board should select me as I have showed again that I can work with families from different social and cultural backgrounds.<br />I  maintain a professional honest and open approach which  families appreciate.
1,6187,1645,6147,Being able to be honest and giving the family information even if it was not what they wanted to hear
1,6188,1671,6147,Contributed to breaking down barriers and thus to the success of a multi-party team effort,<br />Built on previous experience with other forces, and carried it on deployment to another force.<br />Better able to understand and explain reasons behind practices which, on he face of it, are foreign to those of my own organisation.<br />Gathered further information to be used in the drafting of Service Level Agreements with Police forces.
1,6189,1655,5794,Prior to OP ROCK, I had no understanding of the chaos caused by a &#039;mass disaster&#039;. I had been on numerous murder incident rooms where one or maybe two people had been killed. These deaths by large had never caused a national reaction. Being involved in the investigation of an incident in another country and talking to survivors who had gone on hloiday to relax and ended up witnessing some of the most horrible scenes imaginable was an eye opener. I have developed my understanding of other agencies and the frustation that is involved when working in an international multi agency investigation, plus the aftermath that was left behind
1,6190,1678,6147,I successfully acheived respect and formed a strong relationship with the family I was depolyed with as an FLO. I am now also competent with the completion of the DVI forms and the collection of Anti Mortem  Data. I have gained a great deal of experience from working on this deployment, and feel that I would be an asset to any further, similar incidents to pass on my knowledge and experience.
1,6191,1674,6147,This was the first time I have worked in a family liaison role. Much of this ime was spent with the Annelie Vickers mum and step dad, taking statements and going through the DVI Process. This whole experience has made me aware how demanding an FLO Role is. It was nice to receive a letter from Anelie&#039;s mum thanking me and other officers for the part we played in Sharm. I would like to think that I displayed the necessary compassion which was required in the circumstances.<br />This was the first time I have worked abroad and I will never forget the experience. The worst part was working in the mortuary for a day, where we logged various body parts from 9 body bags.
1,6192,1667,6147,This was the first time I have had any experience as an flo<br />it was the first time i have completed dvi forms<br />it was the first time i have been deployed abroad<br />it was the first time i have done any mortuary work<br />it was the first time i have had experience of body parts<br />i showed great deal of versatility and flexibilty during my deployment<br />as i acted as a<br />flo<br />mortuary assistant<br />outside enquiry team officer<br />exhibits officer
1,6193,1649,6068,Op Rock developed me because I was able to adapt to various diferent roles within the Casualty Bureau basically being able to cover other peoples roles when required.  Utilising existing communication skills I was able to secure necessary essential equipment for other areas of the operation.  Having done the work as an FLO on Bracknell I was able to observe some of the difficulties from the Casualty Bureau side of things hopefully making me a more understanding FLO.
1,6194,1663,6147,The fact that I was a member of the west midlands police team, who never having experienced this form of incident, deal with the situation in a professional and compatent manner, adoted to a dynamic  situation and were able to provide help &amp; support to others.  The service should be duly credited with the display of professional commitment shown by it&#039;s staff
1,6195,1638,6147,I was fortunate enough to have gained experience in the role I performed in Op Rock during a previous deployment, I was also fortunate to have a supervisor who was prepared to listen and believe in my judgements but at the same time guide those judgements in the direction where they could be of most benefit to the overall aim of the task.<br />I feel that this has been both a great help in my personal development and would therefore greet any future challenge with enthusiasm.<br />It also channelled that expertise to the place where it  was of most value to the task in hand,  the test of this being the swift return of those we went to repatriate.
1,6196,1662,6147,from evidence and intelligence coming into the casualty bureau, I correctly identified those british nationals who were victims, at a very early stage. Next time I would know which documents to read in order to achieve the same result again, and the actions to raise as a priority, in order to do this.
1,6197,1679,6147,Flexibility<br />Upon deployment to Egypt I was uncertain as to what to expect and was nervous about the responsibility.  The team was selected through PNICC and I was working with total strangers who&#039;s skills and knowledge were unknown to me.<br />Its fair to say that whilst the skills and knowledge of the team did not cover the broader skills required by the DVI process they rose to the occaision carried out whatever role they were asked.<br />The training given is based on early adoption of systems of body recovery, mortuary work and ante-mortem gathering.  It was clear from the outset that these systems were not followed in Egypt.  The whole team worked together to adopt systems and methodology that would work under the conditions we faced.  We did not stray from our committment to find and ethically identify all of the deceased and strive to meet the expectations of their families.   In doing so we formed friendships with Embassy Staff and Egyptian professionals with whom I still receive contact.  As a consequence of our work some of the Egyptian Professionals have taken the time to review their own procedures on Mass Disaster
1,6198,1653,5732,Serious consideration has to be given to what the role of an FLO should be.  The basis for this is the fact that information coming from the Theseus and Bracknell feedback is the &#039;Gold&#039; standard is being set by the Met.  However, this would appear to be  without any wider consultation with other forces or organisations.  The continued engagement with a family is being asked to go on for a protracted period of time and some of these functions are merely to act as a mouth piece for the MIR.<br />An example is a document that comes from the Coroners department.  FLO&#039;s have been asked to circulate this to their family.This sets out the role, function etc of the coroner which is useful info.  It also has in there that if a family member would like to make a comment about their loved ones at the inquest they can OR an FLO will give it on behalf of them!  Who decided this?  The prime responsibility of an FLO is as an investigator.  ACPO must be very clear on this.
1,6199,1636,6178,Who viewed the deployment as a jolly? The conditions in Egypt were appalling and the team overthere worked tremendously hard. I am staggered that anyone could describe the deployment in such terms and it sounds like someone is terribly missinformed.
1,6200,1675,6147,I have gained a vast amount of experience in dealing with an incident of International importence.Liasion with outside agencies such as FCO,FSS and colleagues from other forces.I have gained a vast amount of knowledge of recording,movement and continuity of exhibits throughout the country which will stand me in good stead for any future operations/incidents.<br />I have also learned  about the various roles of my colleagues which has instilled in me that little bit more  patience and understanding of the difficult tasks that they perform and has put a brake on my impatience to get my job done and has made me  a better team player.I can say that i am proud to have been associated with the incident and staff of Op Rock.<br />PS get your exhibits in time.
1,6201,1665,6185,you get the job
1,6202,1636,5967,What happened to the risk assessments that were prepared by the incident room for the Egypt team?
1,6203,1685,6147,With dignity and repect I processed the bodies and parts of the victims from Sharm.  The working conditioins were very poor.  I worked long hours in 45degrees heat to get the correct bodies and parts back to the families in the UK.  I requested to be on this team and am proud that everyone came home - it was all worth it. All 10 bodies home - top job  - can I go now?
1,6204,1641,6201,ta!!
1,6205,1636,6176,Please establish a common understanding regarding DVI work. There is a lot of confusion regarding this at all levels.
1,6206,1678,6176,Please give us more support next time.
1,6207,1673,6176,More support shown to SIM and their abilities to make decisions regarding what deployment is required
1,6208,1665,6176,lets get some uniformity between all the forces - its not bad but could be better
1,6209,1657,6176,A decision needs to be made quickly about DVI form procedure before we are confronted by another incident in the UK or abroad.
1,6210,1636,6176,A MOU should be established that recognises the demands placed on officers deployed as FLOs following mass fatality incidents. To have an FLO perform a role such as this on top of the day job is unfair.
1,6211,1669,6176,Each major force,including WMP need an identified,designated and regularly trained response to such incidents, which should be recognised as a specialist role.
1,6212,1661,6176,what a shame the acpo officer couldn&#039;t be here at the start of the day. It would have been nice if he had also introduced himself to all those present in the room.
1,6213,1686,6176,Officers deployed overseas in these type of incidents are under extreme stress.  not only from the task in front of them but from being away from family.  everythin possible needs to be done to ensure that all reasonable requests from scene are granted, putting people before cost.
1,6214,1644,6176,I respectfully request that ACPO learn very quickly to value their FLO&#039;s as most still see it as giving Tea and Sympathy when in fact the reality is that FLO&#039;s are dedicated to giving the best possible support in extreme/difficult and emotional situations which enables the main investigation to run smoothly and reach an early conclusion.
1,6215,1672,6176,A dedicated disaster team with all the training requirements available will have to be seriously considered now.  These types of incidents will become normal in the months/years to come both abroad and in the UK.
1,6216,1659,6033,It was not airside access that was required but to be there to grieve. as per Op Bracknell. a private area to view the landing not the unloading.
1,6217,1685,6176,Listen to those on the ground.  Listen to those at the scene.  These calls will only become common place.  LISTEN
1,6218,1646,6176,Having worked on op-Bracknell/Theseus/Rock.It has been a pleasure to witness mutual aid working succcessfully.(a credit to ACPO around the country)
1,6219,1679,6176,What is a DVI team?  Whilst DVI at home can be rolls royce,  abroad its a SMART car,  cheap and econmical out of necessity.  Identify the minimum requirements and expect continuous change in circumstances. Prepare and equip teams to carry our their role to the satisfaction of the victims, their families and the wider community.,
1,6220,1655,6176,ACPO......You need an insight into the individual roles played by all staff involved in a mass disaster. You need to make yourself aware of how long it takes to fill in a &#039;simple&#039; DVI form when the family member is traumatised by the loss of a love one...and to be aware of the stresses it causes the officers on the ground who have to make life changing decisions whilst not in the comfortable surroundings of an air conditioned office!
1,6221,1641,6176,we are underpaid and overworked. it takes a special kind of person to agree to work with families who have been through this kind of trauma.Most people you ask say they couldn&#039;t do it. Please make sure command teams are aware this kind of deployment is difficult and stressful, not an excuse for us to get out of &quot;real policing&quot;.
1,6222,1652,6176,Please pass on to divisions the role played by FLO&#039;s so that we do not get beaten up whist trying to do the job because they perceive we are not carrying out normal duties not knowing or caring about the additional pressures we are under
1,6223,1668,6176,Please give more credit to the Family Liaison system and to the officers who deliver such a great service to the people of this and other countries
1,6224,1650,6176,I would like to thank ACPO for the support they gave during the course of Operation Rock.  They asked questions, listened to the answers from experienced practitioners and were not afraid to make decisions based on available information.  The command structure was very much a two way street with a healthy respect for both sides.  I had the confidence that I could do my job with the necessary support in place for those occasions where I needed further guidance or strategic direction, without having to run to senior management every five minutes to gain ratification for any decisions I wanted to make.
1,6225,1670,6176,There seems to be an understanding that DVI - swabs, DVI forms, etc - can only be done by FLOs, and that this is national policy. If this is true, which I doubt, it is ludicrous. All police officers, particularly CID and Traffic, need to betrained in this. It&#039;s not rocket science!!! Recruits could be trained at training school. There seems to an element of working in silos here. A lack of flexibility?
1,6226,1653,6176,The role of the FLO needs to be re evauated in the light of these incidents.  It is imperative that the role of investigator is not underminded by the increasing expectations of families, the Public, FLO, Red Cross and even ourselves.  I do not expect or want my FLO&#039;s to act as taxi drivers, insurance negotiatiors or speakers at a coroners court!  FLO&#039;s are volunteers who take on this role on top of their day job.  It is a worthwile role and offers great personal development opportunities, but we are police officers who should be concentrating in the field of their expertise.
1,6227,1638,6176,There were a lot of negative aspects to Op Rock such as the working conditions hours lack of kit understanding of roles cultural differences etc etc however that the operation was a success bears testimony to the value of those involved in it.<br />YOU now have the opportunity to build on working practices and experiences learnt .<br />That we are here today is I hope an indicator that we will not squander this opportunity however<br />The proof of the pudding as they say
1,6228,1675,6176,Please treat these incidents with the seriousness that they deserve and provide your staff with the resources they need to acheive best results.An agreement must be reached regarding deployment of all staff via respective forces to enable them to do the job at hand not what is waiting on OCU
1,6229,1674,6176,definitely be led by the sio at the incident - if more flos are asked for, people should listen
1,6230,1663,6176,credit the difficult roles junior ranking officers perform in the heat of battle, and duly acknowledge and understand the public view of what they due for the service
1,6231,1685,6212,I agree!
1,6232,1671,6176,Form a dedicated national DVI team.  Keep the team together for a minimum of 1 year as a team (not just a clutch of officers on call from their forces) to work through a strategy to cover incidents ocurring anywhere (UK or overseas).<br />Put even more effort into strengthening Interpol so that countries around the world will automatically call upon Interpol in the event of mass casulaty incidents (or certainly those involving foreigners).<br />Make sure CCS and DCMS push ahead with establishing a joint mechanism for dealing with those bereaved by (and with survivors of) mass casualty incidents.
1,6233,1649,6176,It is inportant that the IT (Hardware and Software)side of these operations are properly address.<br />Failure to do so will result in distress on the part of the bereaved/misper families and Police Staff.<br />Very often communications with a foriegn area in this day and age should be a little better than a mobile phone or an email with no &#039;confirmation&#039; of delivery system.<br />Families crave information and all the officers at the scene of the incident are engadged with the identifiaction/repatriation process.<br />There does need to be a factual source of information employed by the Police/FCO so that families can be kept up to date daily. Indeed so that FLO can be kept up to date as well

1,6258,1702,6234,Getting a conviction ar court where the forensic eveidence wasn&#039;t challenged.

1,6261,1709,6234,To enable scene examiners to become part of their borough team
1,6262,1721,6236,try changing to vodka
1,6263,1719,6236,mild or bitter?
1,6264,1714,6236,what no sausage rolls?
1,6265,1701,6247,what sort of journey do you have?
1,6266,1713,6260,or girls
1,6267,1708,6239,thanks for a job well done
1,6268,1705,6255,Are they there to be happy?
1,6269,1704,6255,what is happy?
1,6270,1699,6235,Let the afternoon develop
1,6271,1716,6236,where do you drink
1,6272,1707,6238,how would you define an appreciated service?
1,6273,1712,6239,giving thanks can give a tingle
1,6274,1709,6260,Is this really how we see training??  Sad
1,6275,1721,6249,how often does this happen?
1,6276,1711,6239,positive feedback
1,6277,1717,6239,does this happen often
1,6278,1698,6247,Where do you work?
1,6279,1718,6247,What do you do?
1,6280,1702,6239,So rare it deserves a good tingle
1,6281,1703,6242,also a key part
1,6282,1706,6236,a bigger bladder
1,6283,1697,6247,do you love your job that much
1,6284,1710,6239,people should be encouraged to provide QSRs for work that warrents it
1,6285,1720,6239,not in the fingerprint bureau where the scene examiners take all the credit and commendation
1,6286,1722,6265,terrible
1,6287,1716,6269,one of the 7 dwarfs
1,6288,1710,6285,How bitter! Perhaps it&#039;s because they do the work
2,6289,0,0,Making things work better
2,6290,0,0,How trainees should be assessed

2,6292,0,0,Service level agreement between the faculty and the forensic services
1,6293,1718,6289,Don&#039;t we need to identify what these &#039;things&#039; might be?<br />Be more specific
1,6294,1704,6289,better respect for trainers
2,6295,0,0,Inegration of forensic and detective training
1,6296,1708,6289,what doesnt work well?
1,6297,1712,6289,This needs good communction
2,6298,0,0,Improving our facilities
1,6299,1718,6291,I&#039;d agree - its too disjointed
1,6300,1705,6290,I think that generally speaking we expect too much from new trainees
1,6301,1721,6294,respect from whom?
2,6302,0,0,professional development of trainers
1,6303,1695,6289,what do you mean, this is a very generic statement
1,6304,1710,6290,A combination of theory and practical tests which need to be passed before  joining a team on TP for a probationary year of &quot;on the job&quot; assessment
1,6305,1712,6293,Good point what isn&#039;t working
2,6306,0,0,Ensuring that training is up to date
1,6307,1704,6291,trusting people to carry out a task without looking over their shoulder
1,6308,1714,6291,More communication required to clarify and appreciate each others problems
1,6309,1707,6291,there always seems to be confusion over who is running/managing courses and when problems arise who the Instructor needs to speak to.
1,6310,1715,6292,measures of performance - feedback from students/pass rates etc/measure trainers
1,6311,1701,6291,we need to establish what should be addressed by the crime academy and what should be covered by the Bureau so that both units are developing staff effectively
1,6312,1699,6289,This requires commentment of all staff and banding/rank
1,6313,1716,6298,which facilities specifically?
1,6314,1702,6291,so many new roles haved been created it would be good to have an idea of who does what and what the job entails
2,6315,0,0,to identify the needs of training
1,6316,1704,6302,better communication
1,6317,1698,6289,&#039;Things&#039; have improved. However better respect for trainers requires the trainers to be upto date with their knowledge
1,6318,1717,6298,is there scope for an extended site south of the river
1,6319,1705,6297,what&#039;s communction?
1,6320,1714,6295,Do not have seperate buildings
1,6321,1718,6300,I don&#039;t - we should be setting high standards and ensuring that out trainees are up to scratch- if they are not we should do better in getting rid of them
1,6322,1706,6292,timely and meaningful TDP&#039;s
1,6323,1703,6293,thinks surely is delivering training
1,6324,1708,6291,we need to identify all roles from practitioner trainer (SCD4) to P Band Trainer (SCD20), Training Manager (SCD20) etc.
1,6325,1709,6290,AFP courses use aggregation of scores for practical examinations. This is grossly unfair as the written examinations are not aggregated. Each examination should be marked and passed separately.
1,6326,1704,6298,making them more local
2,6327,0,0,What are the tensions that seem to get in the way
1,6328,1701,6298,we need to bring some of equipment into the 21st century such as dvds with subtitles replacing videos
1,6329,1697,6311,there isn&#039;t really any clear guidelines that apply for everyone. Each role is open to too much change
1,6330,1713,6305,I said &#039;work better&#039; which is about improvement, not about blame or things not working.
1,6331,1710,6307,not everyone is competent enough to be left to their own devices
1,6332,1704,6318,definately but there must be corporacy
1,6333,1708,6302,Identified pathways on the Career Pathways to show routes in and out of training
1,6334,1712,6309,This is an important point - why don&#039;t the indtuctors know who to speak to
1,6335,1706,6292,allocation of facilities - more scene rooms would be beneficial to allow the preparation of rooms in advance rather than trainers staying until 9pm to complete
1,6336,1698,6290,Trainees do have  an initial 4 month programme once out on borough
1,6337,1702,6295,Why is there still a two-tier approach to forensics when SCD4 staff are only deemed qualified to deal with cerain jobs and not others?
1,6338,1714,6315,Better liaison between Managers, PDM&#039;s and trainers
1,6339,1704,6328,who&#039;s supplying the money?
1,6340,1706,6292,more varied exam papers for resits
1,6341,1711,6291,Training generally needs to be given a higher priority and then be resourced adequately
1,6342,1708,6306,How about SCD4 Photographic Trainers?
1,6343,1696,6306,Including the Photography course with the initial training would be beneficial
1,6344,1710,6335,And more relevant mock scenes
1,6345,1715,6289,communication essential between trainers and active practitioners/keeping up to date and regularly assessing course content
1,6346,1703,6325,the aggregation is wrong, it is two seperate types of examination, both should be passed.
1,6347,1707,6292,There needs to be clearly defined agreements that are workable for both sides and are fully agreed by both sides.
1,6348,1710,6340,totally agree
1,6349,1701,6302,how will the change in training foundation courses to &#039;occasional&#039; trainers courses affect our future delivery?
1,6350,1718,6295,Not sure what is meant by this. Too much integration could mean that we are giving training that is relevant only to forensic staff to detectives which is dangerous as it undermines our people. We should be seen as the forensic lead and &#039;awareness&#039; is more relevant for police officers
1,6351,1705,6300,In the forensic faculty, it&#039;s possible for someone to fail the initial course in say, fingerprints or scene examination without being given the chance to prove themselves in the workplace - I thought that&#039;s what the probationary period is for?
1,6352,1697,6302,the trainers need to ensure that everyone is teaching identical information. who assesses their suitability?
1,6353,1708,6302,promote training for the valuable resource that it is
1,6354,1704,6327,misunderstanding of individual roles in the bigger picture
1,6355,1712,6335,has a request for this been made?
1,6356,1695,6317,how do you propose to maintain competence and up to date knowledge of the trainers?
1,6357,1719,6295,I am still not sure why,  with all the forensic training capability that we have, that the Crime Academy still has to pay outside &quot;agents&quot; to deliver forensic training to Police Officers?
1,6358,1721,6317,so how do we make this happen?
1,6359,1698,6294,Trainers/Faculty shouldn&#039;t pass students who clearly are not up to the job.
1,6360,1713,6317,Respect is a two way street, earned on both sides.
1,6361,1706,6292,re think the marking policy - aggregartion of practical results is not a true reflection of ability in both areas tested (mv and burglary scene examination)
1,6362,1701,6327,communication can solve this provided decisions are made and agreed
1,6363,1700,6306,the current courses for sexual offence and robbery are very useful mfor new members of staff. However there is no update training for forensic practioners with 7 years plus experience
1,6364,1720,6315,why do we give the most up to date training to new staff but fail to provide any new learning to the established ones ????.
1,6365,1716,6328,is it simply a question of converting the video onto dvd or are the videos out of date
1,6366,1703,6325,we need more scenarios on the serious courses to stop the issues of word of mouth from previous students.
1,6367,1702,6306,Sometimes it seems that the quality of forensic training and information provided to thepolice exhibits officer courses is better than that provided to SCD4 staff
1,6368,1706,6355,it has now
1,6369,1713,6331,How and who gauges this?
1,6370,1715,6315,its the staff development that is essential, ensure this and you cant go wrong
1,6371,1717,6302,can the Academy have an input or agenda for working with business group trainers keeping them up to date, may be development days
1,6372,1711,6311,We need to view issues corporately as a Directorate
1,6373,1704,6295,why do some detectives only want help from forensics when its a job they dont want to do?
1,6374,1721,6309,I agree - there do seem to be a number of fingers in each pie.
1,6375,1710,6350,Simple things such as &quot;should we keep the ratchett seals used on forenic drying rooms&quot; get back different answers from the detective training school and the forensic training school - surely procedures like this should be uniform?!
1,6376,1718,6318,Good point- I think that historically we have not had our best people in training but had those that it suits to be at Hendon. This was true in the past also when we had training at Woolwich.
1,6377,1698,6306,Arson courses are very basic. Advanced training is not available to all.
1,6378,1707,6292,Re think the knowledge and reasoning exam for other courses other than the foundation AFP course.
1,6379,1696,6336,This needs to be outlined better for mentors and BFM&#039;s to ensure AFPs are capable
1,6380,1697,6302,once someone is a trainer, how to they develop or return to borough? Is refresher training available?
1,6381,1712,6350,It is important to remember that the investigation is team work and every team needs a leader
1,6382,1701,6306,training is a living thing reviews and feedback not just from students but scd/4 units the students go back to
1,6383,1706,6292,defintive dates for re sits e.g maximum wait of 4 weeks from failure to resit
1,6384,1703,6290,K R is difficult to mark and it is a test of exam technique, but it must be replaced with a robust test of students knowledge
1,6385,1708,6306,instead of a siloed approach to practitioner trainers, could we not provide an SCD approach to Continuous Professional Development of staff by providing trainers to deliver training regardless of the Business Group?
1,6386,1714,6290,more feedback from line managers to corroborate training level
1,6387,1713,6342,Please expand
1,6388,1715,6327,communication essential - individuals can be very protective of their roles, its about working together
1,6389,1702,6289,Dont let our Directorate become too unwieldy.  We are getting too disparate with each reorganisation
1,6390,1712,6357,Where is the capability - is it accessible to the Crime Academy
1,6391,1720,6327,senior management not releasing staff to undertake training despite undergoing centrex training to become a trainer.
1,6392,1704,6378,This is still open to instructor interpretation - ongoing assessment by CA and TP instructors would be better
1,6393,1712,6373,Do I sense ill feeling
1,6394,1707,6295,If we are to be a recognised Academy of excellence, there needs to be more acknowledgement of the value of the Forensic Faculty and what it can give to the Academy
1,6395,1718,6306,If people spend too long in a training role they are no longer as up to date with current operational issues / practices. The balance is to have people in training who have a sound recent operational background. We need to make it attractive for operational people to go into training
1,6396,1697,6306,there are not enough training courses for arson after the initial 2 day? are examiners meant to just examine with only those 2 days, some people wait years for a full course
1,6397,1695,6294,Respect only comes from knowledge - this has to be kept up to date and relevant
1,6398,1708,6302,improved communication and the support of OCU attachments at Senior Manager level
1,6399,1701,6292,time frames for feedback and better more relevant assessments of students
1,6400,1703,6336,this is clearly set out, all offices have a chart on the wall and it is also in the development portfolio of the AFP
1,6401,1704,6383,this is a must - information drops out of your head very quickly
1,6402,1698,6356,Agreed, this isn&#039;t done, but isn&#039;t some of this down to the trainers themselves? Perhaps regular attachments out on Boroughs/Bureau.
1,6403,1708,6302,no one ever thinks of the development of the trainers
1,6404,1710,6351,That&#039;s ridiculous!  The exams at the training school are not difficult to pass - if you can&#039;t manage them then you are totally in the wrong job and should be regraded before taking up any more time/resources/money of the already limited resources of the DFS
1,6405,1718,6327,Poor senior management / leadership within the SMT
1,6406,1709,6298,Rowan House looks shabby. There should be ceiling mounted cradles for computer projectors with safe cabling to the wall sockets. This is a minimum to give a professional vision of Rowan House. Air conditioning is needed as it is almost impossible to teach in hot weather when the driving school are chasing each other around the skid pan and the only ventilation is to open the windows.<br />The provision of smart boardtablets for use with the smart boardsoft ware we have licences for. The Rowan House must have a lift to comply with Disability access legislation. Some courses are sitable for disabled staff but connot be held in Rowan House. All fingerprint bureau training is suitable for disabled staff. Is that enough for a starter for 10!
1,6407,1711,6290,Workplace assessment after attending training would be useful to ensure the skills learnt are being applied in the workplace
1,6408,1715,6302,sharred information is essential, keeps you up to date , works from both sides
1,6409,1700,6290,the current training and assessment of AFP on the initial course does not use the equipment which they will subsequently use on Borough. For example they are trained to lift footwear marks with ESL but we normally use gel at scenes. They are not assessed on the ability to cast toolmarks.
1,6410,1721,6335,And more classrooms would be great, at other locations across London, maybe one south and one central.  In this day and age it is not realistic to expect all students to travel to Hendon.
1,6411,1701,6289,to stop being so negative and build on the good work being done to review and improve training
1,6412,1702,6317,There&#039;s alot of staff out there with vast experience who might not wish to become full time trainers but would still like to share their knowledge and experience
1,6413,1714,6359,faculty passes candidates who have reached to required standard, it is up to TP /Bureux to to decide if not up to the job.
1,6414,1711,6400,But do we know how effectively the mentors are monitoring this progress
1,6415,1708,6290,improved mentoring back in the workplace
1,6416,1712,6405,which
1,6417,1715,6389,very true - change for changes sake is not good, we become disjointed
2,6418,0,0,What are you really proud of
1,6419,1703,6327,Some managers lack people skills and treat trainer/practitioners with no respect
1,6420,1695,6389,The directorate should stick to it&#039;s core function.
1,6421,1697,6298,the facilities are not a reflection of society it is too old fashioned
1,6422,1714,6296,A blame culture?
1,6423,1699,6412,How do you manage this resource?
1,6424,1706,6377,do we need all our practitioners trained to the same level?
1,6425,1702,6350,I agree fully with this comment
1,6426,1709,6377,This is wrong. There is an advanced arson course which includes a 5 day residential course in Essex
1,6427,1704,6320,Won&#039;t police staff be drawn even more into jobs police officers would prefer not to do?
1,6428,1712,6338,how should this take place
1,6429,1698,6292,Better feedback required. 2 lines isn&#039;t enough. Direct feedback to line managers of development needs.
1,6430,1714,6319,EXACTLY!
1,6431,1701,6302,our trainers should be given the opportunity to deliver training within the discipline but to swop with trainers with other forces ie generic traning at Durham. also to look at training outside of their specialism
1,6432,1721,6324,I can&#039;t believe this hasn&#039;t aleady been done.  That&#039;s outrageous!
1,6433,1717,6292,the supply of trainers to run a course ie one trainer from buisness group plus one trainer from Academy
1,6434,1705,6292,It seems to me that no training whatsoever takes place in the workplace because everyone is too busy to show new people the ropes - I think this is very sad - things which should be learned on the job are not being learned so we then have to start thinking about teaching such things in the classroom which is wrong
1,6435,1698,6292,Quicker production of results/reports.
1,6436,1703,6315,we must ensure our experienced staff members are valued and given update refresher training
1,6437,1718,6357,I&#039;d agree and also question their ability to be up to speed on current issues
1,6438,1708,6327,siloed approach to trainer provision. Why not have a general SCD4 approach to deliver training to our students, regardless of which business group they are going to
1,6439,1707,6295,Forensic training via the Faculty is underused. I agree we are often used as a stop gap instead of a point of reference for forensic issues. We have a greater capability than is acknowledged.
1,6440,1704,6418,our expertise and that we are valuable outside theMPS - more than in it!
1,6441,1720,6291,why are we paying for an external trainer to present palm print awareness courses when we are the &quot;premier bureau in the world&quot; quote unquote.
1,6442,1699,6420,Forensics is its core function but will expand as new technologies develop.
1,6443,1701,6418,The way that more progressive and positive managers are having an influence. They are beginning to show up the negative ones
1,6444,1708,6418,what we have achieved. 300   students trained over the past 3 years
1,6445,1709,6363,True but we have to concentrate on those who have not had an opportunity to gain experience and until AFP&#039;s have passed the courses they cannot be promoted to the role that  are held by FP&#039;s
1,6446,1706,6396,the 2 day course is a foundation - this should be built on at Borough by close mentoring from more experinced staff.<br />Practical experience is an excellent way to develop
1,6447,1697,6306,what about some training on communicating with the public many people would benefit from this
1,6448,1703,6367,surely it should be the same information from the college
1,6449,1715,6418,developing staff that can make a difference to the service we provide - for the better
1,6450,1718,6404,I strongly agree with this- we waste too much time on individuals who quite clearly are in the wrong job
1,6451,1716,6318,crime academy requests have been put forward but suitable accommodation is not readily available. The request remains logged with PSD to resolve
1,6452,1714,6343,We did this and it worked. Who changed it?
1,6453,1712,6418,dedication
1,6454,1696,6414,This is also difficult when AFPs cannot get onto relevant courses to further their skills and therefore be assessed at different levels like photography
1,6455,1708,6418,on-going improvements... would we have been doing this 1 year ago?
1,6456,1698,6434,Thats a very general accusation. All new joiners are trained throughout their career where I work. It is our responsibility surely?
1,6457,1695,6418,We are forward looking and willing to change, but should not forget the sound foundations on which we have been built
1,6458,1701,6315,to understand that not all training needs to be delivered in a fixed classroom environment.
1,6459,1706,6294,respect needs to be earnt
1,6460,1696,6444,Yet this is causing a back log in training for AFPs already out in Borough
1,6461,1717,6434,This is a real problem, helping others learn takes a lot of time and is not yet rewarded , we still focus on what someone has done for them self to progress and not what they have done for others
1,6462,1708,6418,the fact that nationally it is recognised that we are doing a good job... is this message getting across?
1,6463,1702,6363,Their is a real need to close that gap between &quot;volume&quot; crime and the requirements of high level crime.  Not only does it require new traininf it also requires a change of mind-set
1,6464,1707,6327,I agree with all of the above. Not having clearly defined positions, not being appreciated for what is done. The silo issue is very devisive so that we don&#039;t work as one unit.
1,6465,1705,6404,sweeping statement - what is ridiculous please? Are you saying that anyone can be &#039;managed&#039; into passing an exam?
1,6466,1711,6411,big steps have been made by the Forensic Faculty with the changes in attitude and appoach
1,6467,1703,6424,all need a good level of arson training, as 24 shifts, the police do not want to leave cordons in place just because there is no one skilled to exam them
1,6468,1697,6290,the training is not as thorough as it used to be, it seems to basic
1,6469,1698,6426,But this is not available to all. The basic awareness course is just that, basic, and leaves the attendees with little or no confidence.
1,6470,1721,6327,There seems to be a reluctance on the part of some people to relinquish or share their knowledge, but I suppose knowledge is power
1,6471,1709,6327,WE HAVE GOT TO SWEEP AWAY THIS APPARENT DIVIDE BETWEEN SCD4 AND SCD20. We are ALL trying to deliver top quality training
1,6472,1718,6465,Yes
1,6473,1703,6426,yes but it is a big step from the basic theory only 2 day course, we do not need all staff trained at the very advanced level
1,6474,1704,6327,There is a negative view of crime scene training at the forensic faculty coming back from TP - it is worse now tp staff instruct - there is a lack of understanding of the roles CA staff carry out
1,6475,1707,6418,The courses that have been developed.
1,6476,1713,6357,This may need current up to date knowledge and wide experience which may not be available at the FF
1,6477,1708,6298,how about a lift at Rowan House?
1,6478,1696,6452,Many AFPs are waiting over a year to get onto a Photography course which means they are passed over to assist at more elaborate scenes due to lack of this skill
1,6479,1712,6422,this is interesting - what place does blame have in training
1,6480,1718,6290,Expand tyhe recruitment process. I know they doa practical now (which is a vast improvement on previos selection provcesses) but could we not do more to weed out those that will never make the grade- extended assessment centre?
1,6481,1707,6418,Our courses are recognised as good by other foces but not always our own.
1,6482,1705,6472,Explain how that works then
1,6483,1708,6296,we concentrate on what doesn&#039;t work well but fail to celebrate our successes
1,6484,1713,6418,That things are starting to change and that the future might be brighter (but not orange)
1,6485,1709,6298,We need an additional facility on the south. There is a belief tha getting to hendon is difficult due to the Northern Line. This last week has demonstrated this.
1,6486,1704,6302,why arent staff who are Centrex trained made to train to ease the burden on the present volunteers - TP managers should not protect them
1,6487,1695,6418,We should be proud of our people and not forget that they have to be onboard for any change to work - their ideas and concerns are frequently marginalised and they feel excluded.
1,6488,1698,6441,Good question, seems like another waste of money that could be spent elsewhere...
1,6489,1697,6290,the training is too affected by who is the trainer, examiners who come and help for a few weeks do not teach the same methods and teach how they would on each borough
1,6490,1708,6418,I was proud of the way we all pulled together for operation Theseus
1,6491,1701,6315,we all have an ieal for training but it has to balanced with the business need and operational commitments
1,6492,1724,6418,working towards corporacy so everyone is treated fairly
1,6493,1710,6465,The exam should be viewed as an initial assessment which gives a good indication of whether you are suited to this type of work.  If you can&#039;t even pass this, then it is clear that this is not the job for you and your skills would be better used elsewhere.  Too much of our time is wasted trying to make the best out of a very poor student from the faculty.
1,6494,1706,6302,the  trainers need to be valued and treated as adults and professional when they come to Hendon.  Some good people will not work at Hendon as they don&#039;t want to be treated like children
1,6495,1702,6471,So why does it seem that the police officer training ie the Advanced Exhibit Officer course is so intensive on the forensic side when there are already hundreds of professionally trained forensic staff in existence already?
1,6496,1716,6457,that will be evident at next weeks 70th anniversary
1,6497,1705,6472,Still waiting
1,6498,1704,6468,It is basic only in that there is more to fit in and less time to do it!
1,6499,1715,6434,very unfair comment, a lot of time and energy is put into developing staff. if it wasnt FSCU - TP would not be delivering the results it is
1,6500,1714,6310,Why not measures of performance for managers and Pdm&#039;s as they take over the continuation training after leaving the academy
1,6501,1721,6405,Some of the SCD4 SMT need to be dragged into the 21st century, particularly with regard to people management issues.  Some of the tales I have heard and witnessed beggar belief
1,6502,1711,6306,we need to ensure that training standards are set to ensure that the spec of what is delivered is consistent to all.
1,6503,1712,6382,Is there a review group looking a forenic results and feeding back to managers/trainers ?
1,6504,1696,6458,Most AFPs learn more once out at Borough than at training
1,6505,1703,6352,should there be a selection process or protocol instead of just anyone who volunteers as we are desperate!! People do not like the travel or the way they are treated at hendon
1,6506,1718,6418,The fact that we have shown that we are willing and have been able to change to meet the needs of the MPS and London.
1,6507,1697,6315,people who mentoe on borough should be assessed for their ability, some do not have the people skills or have not kept up to date with new changes
1,6508,1716,6418,desire amongst staff to improve
1,6509,1698,6343,This alos makes the new team members feel devalued and also hinders there career progression.
1,6510,1721,6498,Then do we need to extend the training?
1,6511,1709,6295,Some trainers at Rowan House believe that we are the poor relative of the family and that the main building receives better funding and a more sympathetic response to requests for facilities
1,6512,1701,6291,sometimes the academy is just ssen as a booking service for the classroom facilities
1,6513,1724,6300,we should expect a high level of service and committment from new trainees but equally our experienced officers should be leading by example
1,6514,1711,6306,Are all SCD4 procedures documented? Do our staff mentor the AFPs to undertake their work following these set procedures. This doesn&#039;t appear to be the case.
1,6515,1698,6473,No, but we need something between the two levels.
1,6516,1704,6384,it is unfair to fail students because they cannot write up an answer in a specific way which has been arbitrarily chosen and doesn&#039;t have any relevance to their job
1,6517,1707,6302,Listening to people and making realistic changes and improvements and letting the interetsed groups know why some things are not feasible.
1,6518,1696,6485,Training which took place at Lewisham was very well received by those working in the South
1,6519,1702,6331,We should be removing the clips from peoples wings to see if they can fly not just stopping them. We should also be there to catch them if they don&#039;t!
1,6520,1712,6377,Has any one from the business group asked the Criem Academy to develope this
1,6521,1697,6315,the training needs to be the same for all boroughs after people leave hendon, it is to idifferent depending on whether you work in north or south and borough to borough
1,6522,1701,6311,smt fragmenting staff has caused some of these training issues
1,6523,1717,6451,could we possibly look at a training facility like a house? we could run real time scenarios and record the exersise, including all the different disciplines that attend scenes.?
1,6524,1708,6452,This was changed at the request of TP to make way for other modules within the same timeline
1,6525,1705,6450,Perhaps the interviewing stage is at fault - perhaps the MPS isn&#039;t targetting the right people
1,6526,1698,6460,Shouldn&#039;t someone have thought of this?!
1,6527,1718,6416,Poor Senior Management Team that does not corporately show good leadership. The culture is very much do as we say not do as we do. How often have any of the SMT walked the floor and met  /talked to staff?
1,6528,1706,6507,suggest madatory mentoring courses for all fp&#039;s and sfp&#039;s - i know its not the answer to everthing but its a start.  afps should make it known to their bfm&#039;s if they are not being supported by their Borough colleagues
1,6529,1695,6290,There is far too much learning &quot;parot fashion&quot;, with the student not understanding the background/reason why they are doing things, just how to do them.
1,6530,1703,6375,there is an SOP on intranet
1,6531,1712,6395,Interesting Has SCD4 personnel considered rotation into training as  development tool
1,6532,1722,6387,yes please do
1,6533,1707,6289,Good communiction so that resentment doesn&#039;t build on both sides.
1,6534,1714,6295,Why do main responsabilities for projects etc always get taken from the Police staff and given to Police officers?
1,6535,1704,6480,There has to be a cost-benefit consideration here, we won&#039;t be recruiting enough and in large enough blocks to justify the cost
1,6536,1720,6315,design of a course to undertake obtaining finger/palm prints at mortuaries
1,6537,1701,6300,our experienced officers are being asked to support so much without any support themselves
1,6538,1719,6476,Why don&#039;t the FF have up to date knowledge and experience?
1,6539,1694,6415,This is essential to ensure the smooth transition from the Rowan House to the placement on Borough. Are the Mentors given enough guidance in the development of the AFP&#039;s to ensure that they are adequate support - it isn&#039;t all about the mentor&#039;s being good at their job, they need the people skills in order to manage them.
1,6540,1703,6322,who QA these..........
1,6541,1708,6367,It is simply different levels of knowledge. The AEO course is very specific to very experienced officers. The AFP initial course is much more generic
1,6542,1699,6531,This is option that is worth considering
1,6543,1718,6501,I&#039;d agree.
1,6544,1701,6480,we should do more than just an application form and an interview perhaps an aptitude test should be re-introduced
1,6545,1696,6510,Yes, AFPs would benefit in spending time at the Fingerprint Bureau to have a greater understanding and more variety of practical scene examination and dealing with the public
1,6546,1695,6290,It is vital that trainees should have a deeper understanding of the subject.
1,6547,1709,6378,Consideration should be given to assess students who fail written examinations by means of a Viva. This could be a more suitable assessment than a 2 1/2 hour written examination
1,6548,1708,6542,this was much easier when we were all SO3.
1,6549,1705,6468,This may be because staff are being recruited in such numbers it is reduced to a &#039;factory&#039; process which can lead to lowering of quality
1,6550,1703,6340,Students are finding out from previous students
1,6551,1704,6534,why do senior staff seem to task police staff and then retask again to police officers when they havent given the staff the time to deliver - this is very demoralising and devaluing
1,6552,1702,6327,A lack of contingiency planning for when a large number of vstly experienced staff start retiring over the next 2 to 5 years
1,6553,1701,6391,we have to work together to overcome these people who have a blinkered view of development
1,6554,1706,6474,then document this so we are all aware of the CA&#039;s staff roles, responsibilities and what they actually do.
1,6555,1724,6321,I agree - we should keep the standard. But our teaching methods must reflect individual learning styles to be fair to everyone
1,6556,1720,6486,ditto fisc senior management
1,6557,1697,6295,the intergration may help the forensic training improve as the detective side seems so much better even though they should surely be behind the forensic side
1,6558,1709,6378,Every knowledge an reasoning examination I have ever sat was 3 hours long. The K R exams should be 3 hours long. It is better that students have too  uch time than not enough.
1,6559,1721,6315,Better planning with regard to numbers of students to be trained so that we do not find ourselves in the situation of suddenly having 60 new AFPs to train and having to shecdule in additional courses
1,6560,1713,6420,Core function is fine as long as it retains value and relivance - What if the core function dies.
1,6561,1712,6419,then they do not deserve to be a manager in the MPS
1,6562,1705,6489,Trainers should be based at the FF and not &#039;parachuted&#039; in to deliver a course!!
1,6563,1697,6302,trainers need to be assessed as well
1,6564,1703,6474,not from the students, trainers or BFMs although can&#039;t speak for all
1,6565,1695,6302,Trainers should not be permament college staff
1,6566,1715,6493,i agree, using valuable time and resourses on unsuitable candidates is unfair on those that are meet our requirements. I believe everyone needs a second chance, BUT.....
1,6567,1713,6571,Needs to lay out clear roles, responsabilities and expectations
1,6568,1695,6327,The college should concentrate more on organising courses and not actually teaching.  That should be left to trainers seconded form their day jobs.
1,6569,1695,6512,This is in essance what they should be.  The training should be mainly carried out by staff form Tp, Bureau etc
1,6570,1709,6418,Encouraging staff to research training that is available to improve themselves. Getting them to realise that training is not GIVEN as a right but for staff who will benefit from it
1,6571,1722,6292,OK so now we have opened the box what would the SLA look like
1,6572,1701,6571,clearly defined responsibilities for maintenance of material
1,6573,1702,6571,Structured mandatory continual professional training at regular intervals that is adhered to
1,6574,1704,6571,timescales, exam requirements, agreed level of attainment
1,6575,1714,6571,A big piece of paper with writing on, lots of good intent but no substance
1,6576,1703,6571,agreed times for resits
1,6577,1717,6571,unified aproach to supply of trainers
1,6578,1698,6571,Deployment of trainers. Either TP or Faculty based, not both.
1,6579,1715,6575,so cynical
1,6580,1707,6571,clear outline of roles and responsibilities for  SCD4 and SCD20 staff who are involved in training
1,6581,1701,6571,who manages the students while they are at the academy - is it the trainer or the academy training managers
1,6582,1709,6571,Accrediation for trainers which would have meaning for promotion criteria. This would recognise the very positive benefit that an individual has made to development within SCD4
1,6583,1703,6575,can be useful if agreed by both sides and meets the business need
1,6584,1718,6571,Establish a co-ordinating role for training taking an overview of who has done what, when etc and what training is required. (this would take us away from the current situation where we are asked on a yearly basis what we have done and also get some corporacy)
1,6585,1704,6577,tp staff to commit to supplying trainers without development managers having to beat them up
1,6586,1714,6571,An agreement of commitment that MUST be adhered too.
1,6587,1695,6571,The college should concentrate on organisation of courses.  Delivery should be by people who come in from the different parts of the Directorate especially to teach specific things.
1,6588,1712,6571,Needs to cover the provision of experienced personnel posted or seconded to the crime academy for a fixed period say 12 months minimum. This would ensure that each course is delivered to the same standard and prevent the trainers becoming stale
1,6589,1701,6578,operational trainers have an important role to play in keeping the training &#039;real&#039;
1,6590,1697,6571,everyone to know what they are talking about. To give out the correct up to date information. For all included to realise they should be working together.
1,6591,1717,6572,who is responsible, how often material is updated, review dates built in.
1,6592,1702,6571,The facility to refer under-performing staff back to the Academy for more training in he areas that thy&#039;re deficient in
1,6593,1724,6571,written feedback to be supplied via tdp&#039;s within a set time scale
1,6594,1696,6584,Agreed, Being booked on courses well in advance is neccessary for continual growth
1,6595,1706,6581,suggest the academy
1,6596,1701,6586,i disagree you should have criteria that are manageable not infexible
2,6597,0,0,Log
1,6598,1716,6571,need to agree criteria  for identification and appointment of pratitioner trainers e.g duration of secondment, elevation of status of training secondment so it will benefit individual
1,6599,1711,6571,SCD 4 define the current processes/procedures. CA design the training to deliver the learning. SCD4 responsible for informing CA of changes to processes.
1,6600,1712,6582,I like this
1,6601,1715,6585,very true - need an agreed amount on each of the 4 clusters or ratio based
1,6602,1707,6571,FF staff included in discusions on career pathways for TP and bureau staff.
1,6603,1721,6571,It needs to contain agreement about the number of courses that will be delivered, the type of courses and the number of students per course.  Also agreed standards of marking to define pass/failure
1,6604,1713,6571,Perhaps individuals also need a &#039;statement of expectation&#039; which could out line their individual responsabilities. For example an associate trainer will...... or FF trainers will...
1,6605,1710,6592,I completely agree with this
1,6606,1705,6578,The current system with trainers coming from the workplace produces extremely variable quality of training from excellent to mediocre
1,6607,1703,6595,the trainers have responsibility in the classroom
1,6608,1704,6578,There needs to be an understanding on TP that there has not been any allowance made for CA trainers to teach - the people could not be attracted. This will prevent the griping that CA managers do nothing
1,6609,1720,6582,have you not heard, achievement and experience mean nothing. its more to do with how you fill in the application form
1,6610,1708,6571,We should work in partnership for the mutual benefit of our staff. Clearly defined roles, responsibilities and managment criteria. We are all MPS staff and our aim should be to provide the best service we can.<br />Policy on training material, TDPs, Trainer qualifications, student feedback, mentoring, storage of training files, unfied strategic training requests to meet organisational needs
1,6611,1706,6578,operational trainers keep the training relevant and have recent expereince of the real world
1,6612,1710,6602,Why do staff from Fulham specifically need to get involved?
1,6613,1714,6292,TP fingerprint branch to commit staff and make sure they keep to thet commitment
1,6614,1709,6571,Shared training for both groups of trainers where there are common issues
1,6615,1716,6575,must be binding on both parties
1,6616,1708,6604,excellent idea
1,6617,1698,6589,Have them on a longer rotation. They are no use to either area under the current program.
1,6618,1717,6585,why is it that  staff are not attracted to training
1,6619,1704,6608,this needs clarification this should be CA managers to teach
1,6620,1706,6606,then honest feedback is needed to the managers - how can this be adressed if no one is aware
1,6621,1702,6571,The Academy to facilitate higher learning rather that outside agencies
1,6622,1712,6587,how you manage the situation when the person coming in was working the day before and picks up a comple job.
1,6623,1718,6585,Do you have any witnesses?
1,6624,1701,6604,no such thing as an associate trainer either a trained trainer or not!
1,6625,1713,6606,Perhaps FF staff could provide training and development to others
1,6626,1700,6577,This needs to be addressed. The current system of an e-mail to the borough based trainers results in the same old faces turning up. Some trainers put themselves forward for the CENTREX training but then never come up to the academy to teach. There needs to be a specific rota put out by the Developement Manager so that all do their share
2,6627,0,0,10 days
1,6628,1694,6592,The appropriate support structure from a Borough level also needs to go with this, so that the development can be managed once refreshers have been given.
1,6629,1698,6592,Shoudn&#039;t be passed out in the first place if they are not upto it in the college.
1,6630,1716,6607,trainers ought to consider themselves as part of the academy
1,6631,1712,6605,so do I ,but it needs honest and efficicnet managers
2,6632,0,0,10 weeks
1,6633,1695,6571,Generic topics can be delivered by SCD20, but the majority of lectures should be given by SCD4 staff who carry out these functions on a daily basis.
1,6634,1715,6611,allowing individuals to train should be seen as a reeward not a chore, theyve proved themselves in the work place, then allow them to pass on this knowledge
1,6635,1704,6603,This is okay if tp dont keep moving the goalposts
1,6636,1705,6611,This is the only benefit - otherwise training is a &#039;secondary&#039; role which leaves room for substandard training by a few
1,6637,1713,6609,You can&#039;t fill out the application unless you can evidence the experience and achievement.
2,6638,0,0,10 months
1,6639,1697,6571,The recuritment process should be longer to weed out those who will not pass without too much help, this will also stop people joining and not intending to stay or commit. The dismisal process should be shorter don&#039;t drag it out, the discipline procedure should not vary person to person depending on whether your face fits, prommotions should also not depend on this
1,6640,1712,6599,can we have regular dialogue to ensure this happens - quarterly meeting maybe
1,6641,1703,6593,Why do the college input on TDPs when they have no dealing with the students, comments of &quot;well done&quot; from a manager that does not know the student are irrelevant.<br />But the TDPsmust hve good constructive coment from the trainers.
1,6642,1721,6571,This is probably a verry silly question but why is SCD4 not part of the Crime Academy?
1,6643,1709,6581,Both visiting trainers and academy staff should be working as a team. Sadly sometimes this issue is seen as a power issue.
1,6644,1715,6636,line managers should assess the suitability
1,6645,1724,6592,the Academy can only teach the theory behind the skill. All practical learning can only be done on Borough and management must take responsibility for  on the job training
1,6646,1725,6597,What are we doing well?  Where do we need to improve?  This analasys will provide a reference for all.<br />One document to say what we work too for all to see.<br />What are the frustrations with this?  Senior management not buying in - wil senior management do what suits them.<br />There are evidently 2 cqmps that are not listening.<br />2 xcamps want to work as one however the communication is not getting through.  Having one doc as referral means that all will work as one.<br />Needs are different for each unit - need to ensure that what is being delivered is up to date, uselful and relevant.  No blame just ensureing we get what we need and want.  Needs to be written down!<br />Does the SLA have to be handled outside the Met?<br />Are there silos on the outside of the forensic world?<br />FISC (SCD4) lot of training is delivered by outside - we need to look outside.<br />SLA as an exercise in building trust.  Once people see what is being delivered there will be an understanding and people will see the results.<br />SLA - lever for people to aim at - once they have service level agreement people do not want to go past that.<br />Facilities - Other areas where we can raise funding - if goes to the Commisioner it will be put aside to front man Policing.
1,6647,1725,6597,How do you build lost trust with SLA?  How would you regain the trust?<br />Lay out expectations - define what you are willing to imput into the relationship.<br />What mechanism is there out of the SLA to produce?<br />Support from above is key to moving forward.<br />Does your directorate understand what each unit is doing??  How do u get the shared mental model?  By working and negotiating with who will be responsible for certain elements of the training.<br />Do the courses link up - overview of other depts in directorate?  No<br />Review system needs to be built in with SLA.
1,6648,1708,6627,publicise roles and responsibilities
1,6649,1714,6627,set up a focus group
1,6650,1703,6627,help with marking
1,6651,1704,6627,change the exam structures to give staff a far chance
1,6652,1705,6638,&#039;e&#039; learning and other up to date learning tools
1,6653,1706,6632,more varied exam papers

1,6715,1695,6638,In ten months I would like to see a partership between a external accademic body and SCD4 with SCD20 acting as a facilitator, but not involved in the training itself.
1,6716,1720,6638,to have more bureau fisc based trainers

1,6722,1707,6627,review the exams
1,6723,1698,6708,You can plan as far ahead as you need to. They need training so lets get it done.
1,6724,1701,6699,they need clearer direction as these are different animals between tp and the bureau
1,6725,1716,6656,to be consolidated in 1 place so know where to look
1,6726,1714,6627,A greater understanding of each others roles and requirements
1,6727,1710,6687,Initiate &quot;mobile training&quot; where some courses can be taught from the 4 sports clubs, for example, catering for people who live further away from Hendon
1,6728,1705,6707,herehere!
1,6729,1709,6627,Lock the head of PSD in the CA academy until he agrees to start funding some of the improvements needed
1,6730,1704,6627,be honest with each other about what the problems are instead of taking the &#039;smiling assassin&#039; approach
1,6731,1707,6627,proper communication, showing respect for both camps so that there will no longer be &#039;both camps&#039;
1,6732,1720,6638,a new director
1,6733,1697,6651,i think some staff get too much of a chance
1,6734,1712,6670,criculate the prospectus link on the intranet
1,6735,1717,6632,trainers at Academy to update any technical knowledge by visiting relevant Business Group
1,6736,1721,6632,identify the miscellaneous, &#039;one-off&#039; courses that are being run willy nilly across the Directorate and obliterate them
1,6737,1716,6670,this is now available in the Crime Academy prospectus just printed and soon to be available on the CA intranet site
1,6738,1698,6627,Start talking to each other
1,6739,1704,6712,this one example of poor communication this is well underway!
1,6740,1702,6638,Don&#039;t ignore our most senior staff even if they&#039;re &quot;non-practicing&quot;.  There&#039;s no excuse for management ignorance
1,6741,1718,6727,When say catering, does that include lunch?
1,6742,1710,6632,Initiate &quot;mobile training&quot; where cetain courses can be taught from the 4 sports clubs, for example, making it easier for the staff who don&#039;t live in Hendon
1,6743,1694,6706,Needs to bridge the gap between old/new school Scene Examiners
1,6744,1714,6703,Then why hasn&#039;t anything changed?
1,6745,1701,6661,re-energise the current classrooms as they are antiquated and don&#039;t reflect the workplace environment
1,6746,1719,6632,Set up recurring one day seminars to update staff on latest developments
1,6747,1707,6632,closer workingrelationships with all interested parties
1,6748,1704,6683,agree to simplify the marking
1,6749,1708,6638,hopefully we will be able to concentrate on course development as currently the time and resources required cannot be catered for.
1,6750,1720,6732,well said
1,6751,1718,6732,and SMT
1,6752,1703,6683,but only allowed to use Centrex trainers, not allowed to take exams out of Rowan House! TP trainers have other responsibilities in their work place manning the 24hr shift, working to make London the safest city in the world
1,6753,1714,6730,Agreed
1,6754,1695,6627,A series of meetings with the aim of developing understanding between the two &quot;sides&quot;
1,6755,1716,6729,Peel house has some interesting rooms in the basement that could accommodate him
1,6756,1708,6627,less back biting and sniping
1,6757,1710,6736,Wouldn&#039;t it make more sense to open them up for everyone and increase our training rather than &quot;obliterate&quot; it?
1,6758,1714,6717,Who&#039;s being negative?
1,6759,1707,6632,Advance knowledge of who the instructors will be who will be delivering training
1,6760,1703,6683,All managers at Hendon P9 or Centrex trained how about a hand?
1,6761,1718,6738,Aren&#039;t we doing that now?
1,6762,1708,6632,a joint Xmas do!!!
1,6763,1715,6740,thats two way thing, they ignore the workers as well
1,6764,1702,6649,No!!!
1,6765,1701,6732,we need to have a clearer guide as to where their restructuring is taking us - what is the long term picture
1,6766,1709,6660,Kent use houses for their serious scene examination training. It is much more realistic. The houses in Rowan Drive would need to be protected from access by the public/loonies.
1,6767,1721,6292,An SLA makes for a more professional approach to the job in hand.  Nice though it would be, you cannot run a business on godwill and trust alone, there need to be some clearly laid down parameters.
1,6768,1705,6732,what&#039;s wrong with the current one?
1,6769,1698,6683,HAven&#039;t you got enough staff already. Seems a lot of moaning, just get on with it!
1,6770,1708,6638,more takers for the FF Xmas do
1,6771,1696,6723,here here!
1,6772,1713,6751,I&#039;ll accept early retirment
1,6773,1717,6638,review of how development after training course is managed within SCD4
1,6774,1701,6732,How can we respond to training a future workforce if we don&#039;t understand what is expected of us
1,6775,1707,6632,Start to positively promote training.
1,6776,1724,6638,a structured training programme for afp&#039;s by FISC and Crime Scene Managers by way of 3 or 6 month attachments
1,6777,1704,6627,Get TP staff to appreciate that yes the training is more up to date now that there are associates but the reason it wasnt before was because the CA werent kept informed- not that the CA trainers are useless. All the lessons delivered now that tp like were designed by the CA staff
1,6778,1715,6766,if money were no option, aircraft hanger containing all relevant scenes for staff development
1,6779,1706,6757,only if they are useful and relevant and follow best practice
1,6780,1703,6762,there is.
1,6781,1697,6683,TP staff are reluctant to help because a lot of people are negative at the training facility
1,6782,1705,6751,.
1,6783,1697,6632,For Band E staff to be envolved in more meeting and decisions that envolve them. more group meeting between boroughs and depts

1,6797,1766,6792,I helped identify victims, which enabled relatives to grieve.
1,6798,1771,6792,Teamwork made the operation run well
1,6799,1758,6792,pointed out items in body while acting as scribe for pathologist

1,6803,1763,6792,most successful assist in identifying all body parts recovered.<br />creative -
1,6804,1762,6792,I started the communication between the mortuary teams and the photographers so that no time was wasted in the mortuary.
1,6805,1768,6792,enabled all team members to perform multi tasks within the mortuary dvi process which allowed for more flexibility when a member was absent for any reason
1,6806,1756,6792,completion of all details on DVI forms in advance of dealing with bodies.
1,6807,1726,6794,what did you do to make it work for you
1,6808,1762,6796,what sort of detail
1,6809,1765,6793,along with everyone else
1,6810,1770,6800,what is ohsw
1,6811,1761,6798,HOW WAS THIS ACHIEVED
1,6812,1758,6801,were you quicker than others
1,6813,1766,6793,did we get that much of a reduction, did we need to use the INTERPOL forms
1,6814,1756,6798,I agree
1,6815,1726,6811,czxv
1,6816,1758,6784,called to a briefing, felt sense of duty
1,6817,1763,6784,secret wish we would not be required and if so be employed dealing with property
1,6818,1766,6784,The day of the bombings there was a lack of organisation. Then the next day there was the usual disorganisation until we got to the HAC.
1,6819,1761,6784,self tasked: tried to be supportive and assist
1,6820,1759,6784,When I know there were deaths I knew I would be involved as I am tempory mortury trained. So I anticipated not going home for a while
1,6821,1764,6784,phone calls to family. We we on standby for a long time.
1,6822,1768,6784,began properly with briefing at HAC by DCI Williams. Also with introduction to other team members.
1,6823,1756,6784,Initial information confusing and lack of clear guidance from those in charge.  Also lack of preperation as to how to initial respond to incident-no thought on deployment.
1,6824,1772,6784,Initially there was considerable confusion as to what we would be doing.<br />The wrong people started to take control due to rank not knowledge.
1,6825,1771,6784,Told on the Thursday evening to return on the Friday morning with kit for four days. Did nothing to the Sunday!
1,6826,1762,6784,I first was introduced to the Met photograhers and then I understood what would be needed from me
1,6827,1765,6784,I form part of the City Police mortuary team so as soon as the incidnt started it was enevitable that that we would be called
1,6828,1770,6784,Attended the incident 4days into the event as a trained DVI officer and continued in that roll till the end
1,6829,1769,6784,Appreciated the importance of the role we were to perform, an expectation of the enormity of the task and a personal preparation of what was likely to be required.
1,6830,1762,6818,Would you normally be involved from day 1 or not?
1,6831,1759,6824,Agree, it only felt organised when DCI Williams gave us a briefing
1,6832,1765,6824,The supposed training we had undetaken was pretty worthless
1,6833,1770,6824,no surprise there then
1,6834,1768,6825,also recall the 4 day speech which was incredibly naive and unrealistic
1,6835,1769,6785,Victim Identification - no question.
1,6836,1771,6816,I agree sometimes you have to stand up and be counted, this was one such occasion.
1,6837,1766,6785,As I was Temp. Mortuary trained I knew I would be involved in DVI work.
1,6838,1764,6824,Even a suggestion to phone before going to Hendon (for a wasted journey) was not accepted
1,6839,1763,6785,if required by met we would form part of the mortuary team
1,6840,1758,6785,mortuary officer id officer
1,6841,1756,6825,There was actually no requirement for us to be sitting at HAC, until Sunday without being used.  this had the effect of adding to the stress and aprehension.
1,6842,1765,6818,Quickly became clear we were all pretty unprepared for the task in hand
1,6843,1759,6785,DVI team, seizing exhibits, stripping bodies, as per the training
1,6844,1772,6827,As expected despite repeatedly being told too many of us were called in too early. Management seem unable to listen-hurry up and wait!
1,6845,1726,6834,what was this speech about
1,6846,1761,6785,Role was clear, however lack of undestanding by others made my role difficult
1,6847,1765,6785,victim identification
1,6848,1768,6785,DVI role
1,6849,1764,6785,Handling bodies and to identify them
1,6850,1770,6785,DVI team member
1,6851,1771,6785,As a member of a team working to ID the victims
1,6852,1726,6846,what difficulties did you find
1,6853,1759,6846,What others?
1,6854,1756,6785,Knew I would be part of the DVI team , but did not know what role I would perform within the team i.e scribe, property etc
1,6855,1762,6785,I first understood I was to be a photographer for SO13 before the bodies/body parts came into the mortuary.
1,6856,1772,6785,For most of the day nobody knew-which is understandable.<br />Later some of us due to greater knowledge became actively involved, others should have been sent home until Saturday.pm.
1,6857,1761,6852,not included at an early stage until late on
1,6858,1765,6786,Getting on and doing the job
1,6859,1771,6786,Having been able to do the job from start to finish!
1,6860,1772,6785,None of us funked out.
1,6861,1758,6786,did my duty despite trepidation
1,6862,1762,6786,Being respectful about everything we dealt with and not trivialising the smaller exhibits
1,6863,1770,6786,52 Idents in 6 days JOB DONE
1,6864,1764,6786,working on a major incident which had a real worth
1,6865,1759,6786,I know I did a good job which had an obvious knock on effect.
1,6866,1763,6786,Stood up and was counted when it came to it. No excuses like no jabs, no course etc
1,6867,1766,6786,I am proud that I work as aPolice Officer and that I had the oppotunity to do something to help aftervthe bombings. I am also proud that I worked as a team, which worked well and completed the task.
1,6868,1765,6786,Coping in difficult circumstances
1,6869,1761,6786,Rolled up sleeves and got on with it
1,6870,1768,6786,Sheer resilience of myself and fellow officers to see it through to the end. Coping with abstraction from family, normal life, to see that victims were served as best as could be
1,6871,1769,6786,Having dealt with a very difficult job, being outside of &#039;normal&#039; policing duites, that was so important and valued and appreciated by others.
1,6872,1772,6786,None of us &#039;Funked out&#039; we all did our job not dropping out, knowing others would have to fill in.
1,6873,1756,6786,prior to this event I had only seen one dead body.  I was very concerned that i would not be able to deal with it and would have to leave the incident.  very proud that I was able to complete it ans suprised that it did not effect me more deeply.
1,6874,1761,6786,Staff were willing to be helpful and accommodating
1,6875,1770,6786,Enthusiasm was the key to sucess
1,6876,1765,6786,made it work the way we always do by getting on with the task
1,6877,1759,6786,good spirits and banter between all involved
1,6878,1766,6786,All the forces and agencies worked well together. The logistics were a bit slow but impressive.
1,6879,1771,6786,All three forces worked as one to get the job done.
1,6880,1769,6786,The team worked well as combined agencies and there was an appreciation of each others contributions
1,6881,1763,6786,Initiallythought teams were to consist of City officers only but whole team pulled together as a result of City Met and BTP forming joint teams
1,6882,1764,6786,It was professional and a good set up to work with officers from other forces within the team
1,6883,1756,6786,Eeverybody there stood up and was counted.  Each and everyone of the City officers were very professional and did it in good spirit.
1,6884,1761,6786,Proud to be associated with the good work achieved by the CoLP
1,6885,1762,6786,Working like crazy around the clock so that some of the Metropolitan Police photographers could leave and attend other scenes as a lot of things were going on whilst Theseus happened
1,6886,1765,6862,what like the birds nest and umbrella?
1,6887,1769,6786,Good humour was maintained
1,6888,1772,6786,The City of London Police team contributed out of all proportion,bearing in mind the size of the force, to the operation. It wasn&#039;t just &#039;Team Met&#039; by any means.
1,6889,1765,6879,ditto
1,6890,1756,6786,Very proud of my family, who had the hardest job throughout Thesus.
1,6891,1768,6786,city police did themselves proud during theseus as did officers from other forces. The integration of officers was essential as it prevented tribalism. My team became very effective and close knit
1,6892,1758,6786,worked because experienced detectives did a lot of it. theyre used to getting dirty and getting on with it
1,6893,1771,6887,This was essential to get through it.
1,6894,1764,6787,Having kit for 4 days
1,6895,1759,6787,daily hangovers
1,6896,1770,6786,none
1,6897,1764,6787,Trying to remortgage my property at the same time
1,6898,1765,6787,working with the arrogant !&amp;*$!! from SO13
1,6899,1758,6787,problems at home
1,6900,1759,6787,wearing sandals
1,6901,1771,6787,Home matters needed to be resolved, which was differcult as we did not know went we would finish.
1,6902,1761,6787,point of contact to make decisions
1,6903,1762,6787,Fighting my way around the mortuary tables when everyone crowded around in order to do my job with stepladders and a camera
1,6904,1756,6787,Initially lack of kit.  Seperation from family.
1,6905,1762,6787,Freezing conditions in the mortuary
1,6906,1766,6787,Abstraction from normal family life for a long period, which obviuosly affected the dynamics of my family.<br />The amount I was expected to drink by my colleagues
1,6907,1771,6898,Yes, they thought they were above as!!
1,6908,1765,6787,Confusion caused by crime scene managers who all had a different idea of what we were meant to do
1,6909,1772,6787,Insufficient clothes, separation from family, too much sitting about.
1,6910,1764,6898,It transpired that the SO13 badge was elite, even though some were from provincial areas
1,6911,1759,6787,bar prices at the hotel
1,6912,1762,6787,Carrying on working when we heard (initially) that another 4 bombs had gone off
1,6913,1765,6905,Apart from when it was baking hot
1,6914,1768,6787,absence from family<br />lack of clothing<br />too many briefings from city management some of which contradicted previous directions eg corporate card useage.<br />coping with smells during mortuary duties.
1,6915,1762,6787,Poor mortuary managers who did nothing
1,6916,1756,6908,Not sure what there role was, some were just in the way.
1,6917,1762,6787,No accomodation provided
1,6918,1770,6786,It was the satellite SO13 personnel who seemed to become Pathologists and bomb making experts overnight. A guy from Nottingham springs to mind.TO/55/ER
1,6919,1766,6898,SO13 were quite obviously under staffed. Whilst there were a higher proportionate of &#039;i know what I&#039;m doing, you don&#039;t&#039; types, I saw this as a re-education challenge instead of a point of confrontation.
1,6920,1763,6787,Disappointment that a senior officer stated at a Team Leaders meeting that those who were dealing with the body parts were only doing so well due to being motivated by the team leaders. This was B***ll****s as everyone that was doing the work was self motivated. It worked really well without a rank structure
1,6921,1764,6914,sorry about the smell
1,6922,1762,6787,Being told pay would be different for some of us within the same Force
1,6923,1772,6787,Working practices at first reinforced the adage that &#039;repetition is the bedrock of the police force&#039;.
1,6924,1769,6787,Lack of preparation for such an incident in regards to kit, initial mortuary &#039;setting up&#039; problems, familiarisation with DVI &#039;in progress, COLP supervisory nievity as to our role and having to have an input where not necessary
1,6925,1765,6919,oh lardy da
1,6926,1761,6787,lack of resources utilised that were available in-house rather than reliant upon MET
1,6927,1766,6900,It&#039;s better than having trench foot!
1,6928,1768,6908,crime scene managers were inconsistent one inparticular gave no direction while others were superb
1,6929,1771,6924,Are we any further forward then now???
1,6930,1765,6787,lack of training and forethought by management as to how we would really cope
1,6931,1772,6787,An idiotic &#039;naughty boy&#039; briefing from a Met Inspector on day two or three,  we were all grown up volunteers, perhaps he should have taped himself as a training aid.
1,6932,1756,6904,City management poor in the intial handing out of kit, it was a free for all.  When pointed out to one senior officer (Who had already grabbed his kit) he stated thats what police officers are like.
1,6933,1765,6787,to much waiting around
1,6934,1766,6908,Some of these were a bigger pain than the SO13 people
1,6935,1726,6931,do you want to expand on this?
1,6936,1769,6914,Lack of consistency in direction from COLP supervisory at time when moral was at its height and the main task was about to begin.
1,6937,1761,6787,lack of information in order to feed back to my Team as to how they could actively assist
1,6938,1726,6915,what should they have been doing
1,6939,1768,6931,complete pillock who should take a long hard look at himself
1,6940,1763,6787,good idea to have a god ideas book or books. Bad idea not to provide said books
1,6941,1765,6917,I had a nice room actually
1,6942,1756,6920,I know that the team leaders were seperately praised for there work, which is a disgrace as they did no more than anyone else in the teams and in no way did they motivate us.
1,6943,1769,6924,Learning curve was provided, only time will tell if we are further forward
1,6944,1764,6933,i&#039;ve never known it to be different
1,6945,1759,6931,What are you on about? I don&#039;t remeber this
1,6946,1766,6931,neither do I, i must have been hungover
1,6947,1765,6897,Nice one Colin
1,6948,1762,6917,Only ECD were looked after
1,6949,1766,6905,I&#039;d rather be cool/cold than roasting whilst doing this job
1,6950,1768,6931,he discussed things such as the press and your behaviour around the site and not taking phones into the mortuary amongst other points
1,6951,1772,6945,We were told not to read the Sport in public etc, the guy only spoke once fortunately
1,6952,1765,6787,Being made to feel that we were doing some really awful job when really it wasn&#039;t that bad
1,6953,1771,6787,Reporting for Mortuary duties in a suit!!
1,6954,1759,6947,that wasn&#039;t me...
1,6955,1770,6905,Er what did you expect
1,6956,1762,6915,Making it work - letting people know when the work would be starting and where and who was needed - this links in with &quot;too much waiting around&quot;
1,6957,1756,6924,Very angry at this idea that the Met were going to show us how to do it, from what I saw of some of the met they had no idea.
1,6958,1770,6911,Didn;t see you buying a round
1,6959,1766,6929,Kit is being sorted out, albeit slowly.
1,6960,1768,6952,personal perspective differs for everyone
1,6961,1772,6950,Agreed but we&#039;re not twelve year olds.
1,6962,1764,6940,A &#039;good ideas&#039; book is not what i want. Too many de-briefs already.<br />Then will anyone brief us on what has been learnt after all this.
1,6963,1762,6911,What a hard life...some of us didn&#039;t get offered a hotel!
1,6964,1758,6787,poor food at hac. met girls did their best but officers deserved something a little more upmarket
1,6965,1768,6930,cant think of any training that would suffice
1,6966,1756,6930,It was clear that not one bit of thought had gone into how were to be initially deployed.
1,6967,1769,6931,Had typical COLP comment from supervisory officer that we would just be dealing with the &#039;City&#039; bodies. Heaven help us if we have a war  and City are assisiting.
1,6968,1770,6923,Sorry could you repeat that
1,6969,1764,6964,separation of building staff (scaffolders)from mortuary teams
1,6970,1766,6787,Too many times I was asked if I was Okay
1,6971,1768,6966,agree from the city viewpoint got the impression that the Mets knew what to expect which was a relief
1,6972,1770,6917,You could have gone home!!!
1,6973,1756,6950,He was very poor and may want to work on his future method of delivery.
1,6974,1765,6960,if they&#039;d done full PM&#039;s you might have a point but I didn&#039;t see the mortuary staff making a song and dance about the task in hand
1,6975,1769,6787,COLP Supervisory comment that we would just deal with &#039;City&#039; bodies. Heaven help us if there is a war
1,6976,1759,6970,you alright dick?
1,6977,1766,6976,don&#039;t start!
1,6978,1765,6976,it was only a little cut
1,6979,1756,6950,Arrogant  MET DI in the mortuary, who would ask at the briefing how many body bags we would want and then compleyely ignore you, why did he bother asking.
1,6980,1772,6952,Agreed my grandad was on the Somme before he was twenty, let&#039;s be realistic about what we did.
1,6981,1758,6978,is it okay now?
1,6982,1762,6975,Surely not!
1,6983,1770,6940,you are fraud squad yu cook the books
1,6984,1758,6933,bad spelling
1,6985,1756,6980,so what
1,6986,1768,6980,dont try counselling
1,6987,1772,6975,Hate to say it but at first there was half an idea that there would be 4 separate mortuaries, with us at the Fire Station.
1,6988,1762,6945,No specific role for COLP Scenes of Crime Department throughout
1,6989,1769,6957,Was DVI TEAM not Team MET as stated on numerous occassions , dont care what the govt say about fewer forces.
1,6990,1757,6914,but they were meeting themselves coming on duty - too little and this made some jaded others were A ok.
1,6991,1756,6967,Like your old force would be better, I guess thats why you are in the City.
1,6992,1758,6788,inconsistence
1,6993,1759,6788,They did turn up and get the beers in
1,6994,1765,6965,how about as an observer at a real incident like Thailand
1,6995,1766,6788,Whilst staying away from home is the best way to get the job done, the impact on individuals families has not been considered enough.
1,6996,1761,6992,please clarify
1,6997,1771,6788,If there had been more bombs on the 22nd July would we have had to keep going.... Or would reliefs be drafted in. There was no exit plan.
1,6998,1766,6788,I&#039;m alright
1,6999,1759,6788,The massage went down well
1,7000,1772,6788,There was an assumption that none us would want to go home, this was true for some but I think most of us were glad to see the family after a few days.
1,7001,1763,6788,just needed to put the money behind the bar for critical debrief.
1,7002,1765,6788,Can&#039;t fault the City but I don&#039;t think the Met got much assistance
1,7003,1761,6997,good point
1,7004,1770,6788,Did not need it They get in the way
1,7005,1758,6788,city have done well overall
1,7006,1762,6788,A day off during the work was most welcome and the 5 days after even more so
1,7007,1772,6788,Should I feel guilty about not being in the least broken up by what I saw?
1,7008,1756,6788,Welfare very good better, tried to do the right thing in difficult circumstances. there if you needed them.
1,7009,1766,6997,the teams worked well together and it would have been hard for a newcomer to get into the dynamics of an existing team.
1,7010,1761,7007,No
1,7011,1771,7000,With the tube messed up I found it hard to get home!!
1,7012,1770,6788,Sorry who are they???
1,7013,1757,6995,Once the team had entered the mortuary - some of those trained but left behind felt locked out and uninformed
1,7014,1765,7000,I think by staying away from home it made us more institutionalised
1,7015,1772,6788,We were and have been very well looked after.
1,7016,1769,6788,City were good on welfare. Helped with a domestic issue and couldnt fault them. Actually believed they wanted to listen and help rather than just saying they did. City supervisors take note!!
1,7017,1768,6788,welfare got their gradually. After a very poor start by City management it improved thanks to DCI Williams.<br />Hotel - absolutely necessary although rumours of using section house did not help<br />Food - good in the end<br />Time off - managed well within the dvi teams when required.<br />Overtime - managed well<br />HAC - Ideal location
1,7018,1761,7008,Further resources needed to support this vital role
1,7019,1756,6995,Very true, not sure how they could do it but the family had the hardest job.
1,7020,1765,6788,Surely we should have all had a compulsory one on one session with a counsellor
1,7021,1766,7004,A bit harsh. I think we probably need the Dept. to be available when we ned them, which is a hard thing to guage.
1,7022,1764,6788,Not sure that the personal de-brief was effective
1,7023,1769,7007,No
1,7024,1762,7017,I have got to say again, SOCOs got no accomodation offered to them until the last week
1,7025,1768,6997,tried to engineer reliefs via DCI Moore but was stonewalled on the basis that it would be too much of a shock for newcomers!
1,7026,1770,7020,My door is always open
1,7027,1765,6788,I can&#039;t fault the desire to allow us to earn as much overtime as possible but the reality is we should have had frequent rest days
1,7028,1762,7022,What personal debrief?
1,7029,1763,7000,At least they threw their voice behind not wanting us back at Bernard Morgan House to save money.!!
1,7030,1766,7014,On our course we discussed this and decided that we didn&#039;t want to have to download on the family every day. I still think this was the right decision.
1,7031,1765,7026,Thats not compulsory
1,7032,1769,7004,They sat in the bar and brought drink, spoke at the front of the room or in the bar area. Job to fall over them I would suggest.
1,7033,1761,7017,Welfare unfortunately were not included from the off hence delay in response
1,7034,1771,6788,Why are we still having de-briefs three months after the event? We have to close the door on it I feel...
1,7035,1756,7004,was your grandad in the somme?
1,7036,1757,6788,its nice to know in advance who is visiting the site as I failed the Cardinal test on the stairwell to HAC rest room by calling him father.
1,7037,1772,6995,I think it all depends on what your family is like, I have always felt I could tell my wife anything from work, and in a way I&#039;m surprised others don&#039;t.
1,7038,1768,6995,worse for families in some respects as they can only imagine the worst.
1,7039,1765,7007,As long asyou are sure that sometime, somewhere it aint all going to come back and haunt you
1,7040,1758,6788,we should not have been filling out welfare debrief questionnaires with your mate looking over your shoulder
1,7041,1756,7004,City response back in Force was excellent.
1,7042,1769,7016,And they knew what they were capable of.
1,7043,1768,7004,humbug
1,7044,1761,7020,Post incident support programme within the Force has been offered and is continuing to be offered, this is voluntary not compulsory.<br />There are also resource implications the Force has to consider
1,7045,1759,6995,They did that letter sending thing though didn&#039;t they
1,7046,1772,7020,Compulsory, no way if I want to talk I will but to be ordered to........
1,7047,1763,7027,If you wanted days off you could have taken them
1,7048,1766,7007,No, I don&#039;t feel guilty. However, I get some weird reactions from people who know me, who obviuosly think that I should be affected in some way.
1,7049,1771,6788,Nice to know Welfare Dept is there if you need them.
1,7050,1761,7028,should be provided by trained debriefers
1,7051,1758,7007,no gladiator is a great movie
1,7052,1762,6788,I hope there was a lot of support for the body recovery teams at the scenes, they had a far worse job than any of us
1,7053,1756,7026,Very dissapointed that the Occ health debrief onl happened two weeks ago and the operational bebrief is only happening now.  Should have been closer to the event.
1,7054,1759,7040,No I&#039;m not!!
1,7055,1771,7027,Are you still okay Dick?
1,7056,1761,7034,Each individual is different it becomes problematic if timescales are set in stone
1,7057,1772,7020,I&#039;m not sure if this the right section but from a stress relief point of view I was highly amused when were told to move from our seats as the Countess of Wessex was coming into the room.
1,7058,1765,7030,Don&#039;t you think your family have got a right to know what you are doing and how you feel
1,7059,1768,7034,i agree this should be the final say
1,7060,1762,7053,I was working a night shift..I think another date should have been made available
1,7061,1757,6788,There were some rumours that we were costing the job(?) too much being located in a swank hotel - is this so?  - are there plans to use these type of facilities in future<br />to hear rubbish like this 6 or 7 days in to the task, doesn&#039;t help you focus.
1,7062,1761,7040,Useful comment noted!!!
1,7063,1766,7055,I&#039;m alright, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to last
1,7064,1758,6992,some great things and then other little things that take the shine off. eg debate over accommodation
1,7065,1768,7036,I too met him and didnt know who he was luckily 6th sense kicked in
1,7066,1762,7034,Because we may well have another such incident and we need to learn what to get right next time
1,7067,1756,7007,I miss it
1,7068,1768,7061,if the job doesnt look after you it doesnt deserve loyalty
1,7069,1766,6789,DCI Williams was good, enough said
1,7070,1761,7046,please expand
1,7071,1764,6789,DCI Williams was very good, a professional. He got my vote.
1,7072,1756,6789,Our leadership at HAC was ok
1,7073,1762,6789,It was such a rush to get the work done..there didn&#039;t seem much time for management in the photog dept
1,7074,1765,7071,Although his jokes wore a bit thin
1,7075,1771,6789,None of the COLP Management knew what to expect so it was good DCI  Williams got a grip!
1,7076,1763,6789,It was DCI Williams who stated that the troops are only motivated due to work of team leaders which was not true.
1,7077,1759,7071,Indeed, there was no way any of the city DCIs would have been able to match him
1,7078,1766,6789,City supervisors, DI upwards was OK but they appeared to struggle to get a coherent line with vthe Met supervisors.
1,7079,1771,7074,And you did not know whether he was looking at you or not!!
1,7080,1770,6789,Senior City Officers could learn alot from Graham Williams....suggest they contact him for a course in man management
1,7081,1759,7071,team leaders - not really needed
1,7082,1766,6789,What did Colin Cowan do at the mortuary, other than gather a couple of more ticks for his next promotion application.
1,7083,1756,6789,Met DI in Mortuary was arrogant and did not listen, albeit he asked to what he was being told.  Very pleased he is in the Met.
1,7084,1763,6789,DI Andy Manning was fantastic stating exactly what the hours claimed would be and that this was not going to be a penny pinching excercise
1,7085,1765,7078,DI downwards you mean, those higher were the problem
1,7086,1762,7080,Perhaps the City needs to be swallowed up by the Met then!
1,7087,1757,6789,the pathologists nice bunch that they generally were did not appear to have had any consolidated briefing whether by meeting or written instruction and the first few days it was chaotic due to their bidding to re arrange the environment to what they each felt it should be - meanwhile the floor walker DI didn&#039;t appear to be gripping them.
1,7088,1764,7071,Who will be the one with experience when he has retired. No-one in the CoLP comes to mind.
1,7089,1768,6789,DCI Williams did a sterling job.<br />City management fledgling by comparison.
1,7090,1759,7080,Andy Manning kept nicking my smokes
1,7091,1756,7084,Could not say the same about the other two very unsure of themselves.
1,7092,1772,6789,DI Manley came through extremely well and should take charge of the whole mortuary response for the CLP. He is not a paragrph builder and should be with us a long time. Best man for the job, ability and a genuine concern for staff.
1,7093,1763,6789,Many Team Leaders had no more experience than us mere mortals and yet were portrayed as being a wealth of knowledge. If they were so knowledgable why did we sort out our own system
1,7094,1762,7087,There was some variation on what was done with parts smaller than 5x5x5.  Each pathologist dealt with them differently - some didn&#039;t open the bag, others examined them closely.
1,7095,1758,7084,who were they?
1,7096,1756,7077,Not sure many DCI&#039;s anywhere could match him.
1,7097,1764,7071,He could get an OBE hopefully
1,7098,1768,7078,Di upwards didnt struggleto get a coherent line they never got that far. Substitutes bench was their role.
1,7099,1765,6789,The problems with SO13/Crime Scene Managers stemmed from lack of management from above
1,7100,1771,6789,Tim Harvey never botherd to visit us.
1,7101,1766,7087,In addition, they didn&#039;t get the same &#039;naughty boy&#039; briefing that we got, so they all had phones in the mortuary and for a long time were walking about outside in scruffs.
1,7102,1772,7089,It wasn&#039;t a City led situation, our experienced officers would have done just as well.
1,7103,1768,7082,he got some tickets for Queen
1,7104,1762,7084,DI Manning spoke up for us SOCOs and helped us a lot to get a fair deal in terms of pay and accomodation
1,7105,1772,7083,Didn&#039;t seem that way to me.
1,7106,1756,7095,DI Manley and DCI Moore
1,7107,1759,7082,he bought dinner once....no wait, he used his corporate card
1,7108,1756,7100,Which was a positive really- well done him.
1,7109,1770,6789,Now we know what&#039;s to be done. No senior officers on site get the job done and go home.
1,7110,1765,7100,To be fair we had so many people visiting I got bored answering their questions
1,7111,1762,6789,What did the Crime Scene Managers do?  Any ideas?
1,7112,1769,6789,Top man DCI Williams, good with the troops and effective strategy. Mortuary managers very good, well those that were there for more than a couple of days just to say they had been there for other reasons. City supervisory could learn so much. Bad timing and bad calls showed City nievity in many respects. Management of mortuary seemed to be good, techies were the tops and made &#039;managers&#039; jobs easier. Leadership in teams was not important if team was good and they appearred to be. Leadership and management of COLP to take note -- YES WHEN ITS REQUIRED!!
1,7113,1768,7092,agreed DI Manley - genuine and an asset
1,7114,1771,6791,That we were volunteers
1,7115,1768,7093,everyone was equal, team leaders only a mouthpiece for the team was the reality
1,7116,1765,7114,well i think we were actually press ganged
1,7117,1761,6791,Be cognisant of the legal implications and the impact on the Force following 7/7 and to refer to specialists in-house
1,7118,1772,6791,There is no need for the vast majority of mortuary staff to be called in for at least 36 hours-this has been said repeatedly but nobody listens.
1,7119,1757,6789,three months on and the seniors of the department we come from and the ACPO of CoLP have not revisited the teams on this incident and given out any guidance on how future incidents will be staffed, resourced, it seems as though the interest has shifted to other matters.
1,7120,1763,6791,No need for rank structure in teams
1,7121,1766,6791,Get the kit and the training done ready for the next time.
1,7122,1762,6791,Can all COLP working in response to such an incident be treated the same in future, regardless of their role.
1,7123,1770,6791,Graham Williams should be commended for his outstanding work at the HAC.
1,7124,1726,7120,how would this work, command and control?
1,7125,1759,7114,Overall I think theseus went well, take note and use it for the next one.
1,7126,1772,6791,Choose the best people for the job, not just the highest rank, and show interest before it happens.
1,7127,1757,7123,and not just a silver QPM!
1,7128,1771,6791,That it took three weeks to deal with 56 bodies and parts, what plans are in place if we have a future event with 300 plus victims.
1,7129,1766,6791,I am prepared to travel doing this job. Would it not be a good advert for the City to promote ourselves as an experienced DVI team, for use in other parts of the country.
1,7130,1761,6791,Training in dealing with these types of incidents should consider the police culture and taboo subjects that need to be considered and tackled in a training environment
1,7131,1768,6791,DCI Williams enjoy your retirement you earned it
1,7132,1764,7122,Does the impact on the way Stat Priority Payments are spread?
1,7133,1762,7114,Can SOI3 and DVI teams meet prior to the work in future so anunderstanding is found for one another - everyone needs to get a job done- we don&#039;t want &quot;us and them&quot;
1,7134,1766,7116,No we weren&#039;t. Quite a few dropped out at one stage or another from the team. I refer you back to the comments about what makes you proud.
1,7135,1772,7130,What&#039;s taboo?
1,7136,1756,6791,On a whole they were excellent, however considering the pressure that were under, both domestic and work it did not help to have a Met DI in the mortuary completeing ignoring your response to his questions ie number of body bags.  Was it his idea of fun to ask the question and then ignore it?
1,7137,1757,6791,Please pass my thanks to Karen Cattermole &amp; John Hussey of CoLP Welfare
1,7138,1769,6791,You have some great staff and this identified the same. Careful on who you promote though!! Make sure we are ready next time by supporting those who are trying to ensure we are.
1,7139,1762,7132,I don&#039;t think so
1,7140,1770,7129,Been there done that,the City don&#039;t want it
1,7141,1763,7124,it worked well as it was with rank not being an issue anyone of us could and on occasions were team leader
1,7142,1768,7129,volunteers only - Im not interested , dont want to chase death .
1,7143,1761,6791,Feedback from debrief to be used to learn and apply lessons for tfuture EP and CBRN types of major incidents
1,7144,1765,6791,why does this burden fall on the Economic Crime Department-why don&#039;t we train officers who are actually willing to do the job
1,7145,1764,7129,If CoLP are to continue as a Force, will this event have any significance? We have &#039;Lead Force&#039; status in Fraud, so is there an opportunity here which will be a plus or minus for our future.
1,7146,1761,7135,red mist and excessive risk taking
1,7147,1772,7144,We&#039;re all volunteers.
1,7148,1757,7144,why is it a secondary role in today&#039;s environment?
1,7149,1766,7135,Wasn&#039;t it a kind of perfume
1,7150,1768,7144,yes - yes - yes  fellow team members were astonished that we from colp had not been volunteers in the true sense of the word. This type of work should only be for those who want to do it.
1,7151,1765,7134,No it&#039;s a core responsibility of the post and as such we aren&#039;t volunteers. If you are a transferee you would have been asked if you were prepared to do this job and I suspect if you said no then you wouldn&#039;t have got in?
1,7152,1764,7144,This role can&#039;t really go to those on shift work as they are front line for incidents like 7/7. Where is there another pool of staff
1,7153,1770,7145,Minus, Met,GMP,and West Mids are infront of us and the job doesn&#039;t see any cudos in dealing with death
1,7154,1756,7121,Yes please, otherwise it will be the same old story again.
1,7155,1771,7144,Surely Uniform are busy doing other important roles out on the streets. We are a pool of 100 staff.
1,7156,1762,6791,Do SOCOs need to be &quot;GIS&quot; trained to assist at scenes?  City SOCOs/photographers  were told this and were turned away at Aldgate.  Two people are GIS trained now and it does not seem to bear any relevance to such a scene.  It seems COLP just weren&#039;t wanted there.
1,7157,1770,7136,At least we knew the test score
1,7158,1765,7155,I didn&#039;t see 100 ECD officers at the HAC
1,7159,1763,7144,pay those who want to be on a call out register a retainer. May sound mercinary but not meant to be
1,7160,1769,7153,How can this be a minus!! How can any body be in front of us. Have they done it in practice??
1,7161,1766,7152,I agree, this responsibility should stay with ECD. I egularly get asked why ECD have this remit. M reply is that we are a pool of people, used to dealing with large amounts of paperwork and that our day to day work can be left fr weeks as enquiries take so long.
1,7162,1770,7144,Burden!!!! you&#039;ve done one job
1,7163,1766,7158,Only those that volunteer, volunteer. Are you proud of what you achieved?
1,7164,1756,7157,Yeh what a winner
1,7165,1769,7128,10 days to identify all. Thats some going!!
1,7166,1758,7012,Thats not fair and quite misguided
1,7167,1768,7162,True - job done - reserve the right to refuse the next one.
1,7168,1756,7162,was you grandad in the Somme?
1,7169,1772,7144,When joining ECD it&#039;s part of the package-or is it OK for some but not special people-obviously this excludes those with good reasons not to take part.
1,7170,1762,7119,Very good comment, I agree whole heartedly.
1,7171,1757,6790,That most of us were woefully pre-trained but through no fault of departmental staff.
1,7172,1757,6785,dealing with city casualties only
1,7173,1758,6790,just what has been said
1,7174,1765,6790,That we couldn&#039;t cope on our own
1,7175,1772,6790,Put the best, most capable and experienced people in charge.
1,7176,1759,6790,That early on it must be established who is running the show, most of the gripes stemed from COLP management not getting a grip
1,7177,1771,6790,To take on board our comments before the next bombings... which are bound to come
1,7178,1756,7162,The CoLP were fantastic throughout Op Theseus and I a m proud to say I was part of it.
1,7179,1762,6790,That no where was there a specific role for Ciy SOCOs...and we really do want to be involved and have a lot of every day exposure to dead bodies..surely it would make sense to use us?
1,7180,1757,6790,Milton Ct isan unsuitable venue for similar future events
1,7181,1726,7175,how do you know they are the best and most capable
1,7182,1768,6790,Ensure that only true volunteers are involved
1,7183,1770,6790,Beg to differ... refresher courses were run last year by the Met and the City declined them
1,7184,1764,6790,The experience that has been gained from Theseus must be available to the next generation
1,7185,1766,7171,We were better trained then BTP
1,7186,1759,7181,certainly not determined by rank!!
1,7187,1771,7180,Surely the HAC will be used each time now for London.
1,7188,1769,6790,It must learn to appreciate and trust its staff more. There can not be a much bigger test of those who are prepared to stand up and be counted whatever the duty, or indeed those who arent.
1,7189,1726,7186,so how do you know who to deploy
1,7190,1765,7188,Did Winston Churchill say that?
1,7191,1769,7180,To use Milton Court will show the COLP have learned nothing from Theseus.
1,7192,1759,7185,We were better trained than any other dvi people, the only reason some of the mets were up to spped was because they went out on the tsunami
1,7193,1771,6790,We host the Olyimpics in 2012!!!!
1,7194,1761,7052,Yes
1,7195,1762,7188,I am bored of reading stand up and be counted
1,7196,1766,7175,Are we suggesting that for the purpose of a temporary mortuary that a new management structure be put in place so that and experienced DC supervises an in experienced DI because they have differenrt levels of experience.
1,7197,1768,7169,the package needs to be reviewed its unacceptable to do this line of work because you are told to. Its not fair on theindividual or the victim
1,7198,1756,6790,Contray to what we sometimes think, we are good at what we do and wer good at what we acieved throughout Theseus.
1,7199,1765,7174,but that we have the staff who can be part of the Operation
1,7200,1759,7189,By making sure it is recorded somewhere who is experienced
1,7201,1764,7171,I don&#039;t think that training can prepare for the real thing, but now the package can refer to a true example, with people who have done the job
1,7202,1770,7189,Call out list....simple. The Met have one . Are you on it???It&#039;s not rocket science
1,7203,1757,6790,I heard that the Inspector (N Yorks) who had lectured us and given rudimentary training on a number of ocassions was not allowed in to HAC to see the Mortuary in progress, was this elitism or just a need to stop contamination?
1,7204,1759,7203,no, he was on holiday in america
1,7205,1766,7171,I don&#039;t think any amount of extra training could prepare anyone for what we did.
1,7206,1771,7198,Yes I agree not bad for a bunch of volunteers who have never done anything like this before.
1,7207,1768,7196,I have no problems with this and dare i say it IM a Supervisor hiss spit
1,7208,1765,7204,and he&#039;s no longer a POlice Officer
1,7209,1769,7196,Would it matter.
1,7210,1756,7196,Why dont wwe use thee same systme as public order where an experinced officer acts as the tatical advisor regardless of rank.
1,7211,1757,7185,thats not a benchmark!
1,7212,1756,7185,and the Met
1,7213,1766,7201,On any future courses, one or two of us should attend to answer questions/concerns and to give our views on the course as it happens.
1,7214,1770,7193,I&#039;m in the 100 metres
1,7215,1762,7211,Well said
1,7216,1772,7197,So its fair on some other Johnny?
1,7217,1768,7186,a junior officers comment no doubt
1,7218,1765,6789,don&#039;t insult us by calling us Team Met
1,7219,1763,7217,a DS&#039;s comment  no doubt
1,7220,1765,6789,For god seek sort the DVI forms out and stop duplicating things
1,7221,1770,7193,and pole vault
1,7222,1768,7219,you took the bait
2,7223,0,0,The most creative thing I have done in a Hydra Suite
1,7224,1775,7223,good morning
1,7225,1792,7223,add to the immersion
1,7226,1794,7223,Introduced a subtle blend of technology and realism
1,7227,1778,7223,listen
1,7228,1780,7223,developed a exercise that 30 year servuice DCs say they learned from
1,7229,1776,7223,Gone home
1,7230,1792,7223,take the technology forward
1,7231,1791,7223,Got everyone there!
1,7232,1784,7223,created an exercise 10 minutes before it started
1,7233,1795,7223,inclusion of near live interview to be played back into the syndicates
1,7234,1786,7223,learning quickly....
1,7235,1777,7223,Helped put out a fire
1,7236,1781,7223,creating more visually impressive, immersive video/audio. i.e. aeriel footage of a scene.
1,7237,1783,7223,Mpeg&#039;ing Alan Shearers Goal and Displaying it on the 42&quot; Plasma Screen....Great Test
1,7238,1775,7223,created a virtual bcu and website to support our exercises
1,7239,1785,7223,generate totally realistic documentation
1,7240,1790,7223,Found out how it works!!
1,7241,1776,7223,gone home
1,7242,1782,7223,Designed a course that takes cynical old coppers and makes them believe in training again
1,7243,1774,7223,Was and still is encouraging and helping &#039;people&#039; understand the philosphy and use.
1,7244,1792,7223,Introduce role plays into the exercise
1,7245,1779,7223,Transferral and amendment of documents from other courses in order to fill unforseen gaps that arise
1,7246,1781,7224,goo night
1,7247,1790,7237,Who is Alan Shearer
1,7248,1791,7223,created an exercise 5 minutes before it started....
1,7249,1780,7235,got the fire service to put out a fire
1,7250,1781,7227,speak
1,7251,1782,7237,I cant believe anyone was interested
1,7252,1777,7237,what could be better
1,7253,1773,7225,how
1,7254,1779,7235,It was only a little fire and it could have happened to anyone
1,7255,1775,7237,would that be duel screen
1,7256,1789,7235,started a fire
1,7257,1778,7226,howdid you capture it?
1,7258,1776,7237,why bother

1,7262,1777,7247,My hero
1,7263,1783,7237,Great Marketign Trick...How to get the most comments....I WIN
1,7264,1795,7236,the addition of wildtrack video and audio to suppliment sensory immersion
1,7265,1782,7237,Isnt that the bloke who can dish out pain and not take it himself
1,7266,1790,7235,Can you smell smoke?
1,7267,1791,7237,Used the Billy Connolly &#039;We want this/that&#039; sound clip during a Kidnap course
1,7268,1775,7236,has that not been done with scene view
1,7269,1785,7236,google earth ?
1,7270,1792,7253,Concentrate on the terminology of the facilitation team and all other players to ensure that the students are kept immersed - for example
1,7271,1791,7235,wow, thats immersive
1,7272,1773,7270,thanks
1,7273,1785,7268,is there easy access to panorama making software ?
1,7274,1784,7248,It&#039; not a competition - what i meant was &#039;10 minutes&#039; not 10 minutes.
1,7275,1775,7238,this has mapping
1,7276,1785,7248,does this mean create, write or code ?
1,7277,1790,7242,Well I&#039;ve been in the job 26 years and I do not believe you!
1,7278,1783,7247,The Best
1,7279,1784,7232,That&#039;s &#039;10 minutes&#039; not 10 minutes.
1,7280,1784,7271,It is if get in the water.
1,7281,1782,7277,You need to go on one of my courses then
1,7282,1789,7277,boy in the job
1,7283,1790,7269,A trampoline?
1,7284,1790,7246,Goo?
1,7285,1789,7254,not the speed of your typing
1,7286,1795,7268,i think this relates to the entire video/audio being seen or heard, this could possibly include the use of street noise or birds singing, sirens etc. to establish a location in the mind of the syndicate/s.

1,7311,1779,7513,We are trying but it&#039;s difficult as the traditional feedback forms only over set areas. The advantage of 10Kv is that it sets so many hares running and then other people can add to points that they would not have thought of themselves but do have a useful opinion to contribute once the discussion has started
1,7312,1775,7296,why? when if you use the profile manager to cut down hydra.
1,7313,1785,7308,develop a hydra coding piece of software where exercise coding can be written using click boxes and option selections instead of remembering arcane coding as elitism
1,7314,1774,7293,Will &#039;business imperatives&#039; eventually determine who has the &#039;system&#039;?
1,7315,1781,7312,This is fine as long as everyone is on version 6
1,7316,1782,7288,There is no way that a team the size of the one we currently have can be the Hydra thought Police for all the sites in the world. Hydra is expanding and with that the administration is to.
1,7317,1779,7293,Should this be a time to start thinking about formal agreements for Hydra Users from 1st April next year with all the organisational changes that will take place?
1,7318,1775,7308,spell check
1,7319,1790,7298,We currently have Hydra, Minerva and 10KV. Is there any new emerging technology or software that will push the boundaries still further. What are we likely to be using in 5 years time?? will it be improved versions of existing technologies or something new?
1,7320,1776,7288,Who decides whether or not hydra is the best tool to use for a particular course.  Should it be driven by the demand of the &#039;business&#039; or should it be driven by those writing the exercises
1,7321,1780,7291,a week long or longer course to introduce Hydra and the methodology underpinning it would be useful. It would ensure consistency of initial training and bond users together. But how to fund it?
1,7322,1775,7308,duel screen for vide play/replay
1,7323,1774,7293,The &#039;changed world&#039; we now live means many others need this sort of facility. Who determines who has what?
1,7324,1784,7313,A simple system would be nice but would the time/effort/resources/money needed to achieve this be justified. At the end of the day, would the exercises be any better?
1,7325,1789,7288,Some subject matter experts do not seem to grasp the hydra system and their facilitation works against the exercise they need an input before being let loose on the students
1,7326,1792,7305,The important issue with IL is the Immersion not the technology, the technology is the vehicle. I wonder how many users of the system truly understand what total immersion requires. I have witnessed some fantastic immersive techniques and also some appalling use of the system which is totally non immersive.
1,7327,1782,7288,It is important that the staff at each site follow the ethics we have always used and control their own quality
1,7328,1779,7316,Agreed - and the needs of the various users may be markedly different; this also links to the inter-agency partnership issues.
1,7329,1785,7308,on message centre, lose document feed area from right hand side and expand area that displays active message into a large text area to ensure readability both at distance and for oldies with failing sight
1,7330,1774,7295,How do you assess in a syndicate?
1,7331,1787,7291,support (telephone) from NCALT - more formal process - call logging/responses etc
1,7332,1782,7288,Who will smack the hands of the naughty boys and girls who break the rules
1,7333,1781,7295,Pro - This can be an ideal tool to enable facilitators/assessors to monitor the progress of a student. They can identify an area which a student might need further training in.
1,7334,1796,7317,Would this require agreement at ACPO level, as all Chief Officers are still autonomous and Forces have different needs.
1,7335,1790,7324,They would be easier to write and run so perhaps there would be more/better courses available.
1,7336,1775,7310,the same for facilitators and team staff
1,7337,1783,7299,The Police Service nationally has created a monster searching Income through generation to fund short falls in budget.   We have created a world where we talk about collaboration and sharing of materials and good practice, but then in another breath are instructed to take as much as possible from other forces and but give as litle away as possible so that it does not effect income streams...At the end of the day its all one big tax payers pot and we are justing moving funds arround, not really generating anything
1,7338,1776,7293,do you try and &#039;sell&#039; hydra to agencies that are not currently utilising it
1,7339,1780,7291,Training of facilitators depends on the exercise, but again a workshop or 1 or 2 day introduction to the general facilitation of exercises would be useful. do facilitators need to be qualified trainers?
1,7340,1777,7305,Managers who have had hydra training have commented it would be a useful method of training to use during a team building event could it be used in this way?
1,7341,1778,7288,Might be quality assurance rather than control. Is the quality of the experience of immersive learning of a consistent standard? Could we describe the ethics and key aspects of best practice?
1,7342,1791,7293,I&#039;d like to see the creation of international exercises (not soley for the travel!). We&#039;ve now got several sites around the globe, which gives a huge opportunity to develop shared learning around world issues eg. terrorism, disaster etc
1,7343,1779,7325,That should be down to the choice and training of the facilitators, it is not the fault of the system nor of the course designers
1,7344,1789,7289,often rushed due to time constraints, more time must be allowed to include this - not just a quickcomment o n the rush to the door
1,7345,1781,7295,Con - Student/Users will or may change the way in which they make decisions during an exercise in fear of making the wrong decision.
1,7346,1785,7308,use of rtf files instead of txt files for tasks to enable formating of feed to inprove readability and presenation
1,7347,1775,7299,who will decide if the exercise meets the standard?
1,7348,1774,7288,This will be the downfall and damage the reputation irreparably if not &#039;gripped&#039; - in the nicest possible way.
1,7349,1794,7288,Is it time to have management group (verifcation team) drawn from this group and others to carry out QA of material and delivery at various sites.
1,7350,1778,7339,Who would provide this?
1,7351,1790,7329,Have a one click button for replies to messages rather than clicking the message, then cling update twice etc etc.
1,7352,1775,7308,list of played tasks
1,7353,1775,7308,cia viewer
1,7354,1776,7295,Would assesment lead to students making decisions or taking actions that they think the assessor wants to see rather than what they really want to do
1,7355,1780,7308,make the syndicate end look more up to date - that 1990s VB look belies the sophistication of Hydra
1,7356,1774,7288,Just because it exists it doesn&#039;t mean that Hydra has to be used. The appropriateness needs to be determined by the Hydra team not the Sponsor.
1,7357,1782,7296,There will have to be a number of changes to Hydra code to allow it the flexibility of Minerva and MinervaFire
1,7358,1789,7291,more realistic allowance for this by managers upgrades rushed and not fully explained
1,7359,1775,7308,task unfreeze button on server
1,7360,1783,7341,You can&#039;t inspect Quality into a product...You build it in in the first place...Quality is a measure of the staff, resources and time you allow...If you want the best, you need to get it, hold on to it and pay for it
1,7361,1779,7334,What about the non-police organisations who are now users - how does this translate across?
1,7362,1781,7295,Con - By introducing assessment this will destroy the &#039;Safe learning Environment&#039; theory which hydra is built on.
1,7363,1790,7308,Full screen video in syndicates
1,7364,1792,7333,We could also ruin the reputation Hydra has as a safe learning environment. Do we fully explain what the purpose of an immersive learning exercise is about. Taking the tools given in a formal educational environment and allowing the delegates to practise their use of the tools in a way which is not life threatening or career limitating
1,7365,1785,7308,use full screen video display and get rid of context and information, replace with subtitles on video.   Students are more sophisticated in seeing video and will seamlessly accept subtitling.   Many students do not read context and info anyway
1,7366,1775,7307,who controls exercise development and standards
1,7367,1786,7295,could Forces include 360&#039; appraisal into Hydra.
1,7368,1774,7291,Anyone facillitating a Hydra exercise needs training in the system but must also have an understanding of adult learning. It is apparent that many do not.
1,7369,1792,7357,Surely small potatoes as opposed to having to maintain and update 2 seperate technologies. Learning the intricasies of one system is enough.
1,7370,1783,7325,Its the pressures placed from on high that lead to poor and rushed courses, with poor facilitators who are just not up to it...But because we have no ne else we tend to let it happen
1,7371,1775,7288,whos role will this be the mets or centex
1,7372,1794,7339,If we have expections of students/candidates in relation to professional competence, then we should have the same criteria for facillitators
1,7373,1779,7295,HR and management need to assess anyway - is it not time that, in everyones interests, we give them what is undoubtedly the best tools to do the job
1,7374,1795,7310,who are these loggist, as every exercise brings new people into the arena.<br />setting aside time, people, resources such as rooms to conduct this continual updating is very intensive and invasive, as for example rooms are currently being double booked already.<br />The training of facilitators, how would this be conducted and by whom? Would this develop into a national or international standard.
1,7375,1778,7354,Would we be assessing individuals against the competency framework or outcomes of the exercise or, like the SIO programme, should the assesment come later in the workplace?
1,7376,1774,7293,CEPOL already use Hydra for disaster training and there is a huge market of CEPOL training that could be &#039;tapped&#039;.
1,7377,1783,7308,Should it not be driven by the demands and the need from a TNA...Maybe there nees to be more of a research group in this area...Some Blue Sky thinking
1,7378,1791,7308,Instead of time consuming syntax columns to complete, it&#039;d be great to see a windows based facility to add Hydra &#039;fire&#039; instructions?
1,7379,1779,7289,I would like to be able to run 10Kv after every Hydra course
1,7380,1785,7308,ensure playable formats in hydra keep up with technology i.e ensure mpg, m2g, mp3, mp4, wmv, wav, jpg, tiff, png, jpg2000 etc are all usable
1,7381,1787,7308,method to code &amp;  send audio to separate channel on client connected to radio/phone
1,7382,1784,7288,I believe that it is our job, as experts in the use of these established methodologies, to ensure that they are used in accordance with the way in which they were intended. This demands that we actually become experts in their use. We need, in the first instance, to understand the methodologies and concepts of immersive learning before we consider how to use them and what technology to employ.
1,7383,1792,7298,What about integrating Video conferencing facilities into a suite, this would allow remote syndicate working. The facilitator and control team could be in one location with the syndicates spread around the country
1,7384,1776,7347,What is the standard in the first place
1,7385,1789,7307,how will the disappearance of centrex and the emergence of NPIA affect the hydra world? Will the same/better support exist?
1,7386,1775,7368,not just using the log viewer as a get out of doing any work option and not being a facilitator and becoming a cognative machine
1,7387,1779,7293,Are SOCA going to be Hydra users? If so, how does this sit with the current set ups? Who will be the service provider?
1,7388,1791,7335,Absolutely agree. Let&#039;s make it easy and fun for us as well......
1,7389,1774,7293,The major shift needed is an understanding of what Hydra can and cannot do in terms of it&#039;s appropriate useage.
1,7390,1781,7305,Managers or major stake holders of hydra within a force don&#039;t always fully understand how Hydra works. Therefore you have the misconception that anything and everything should be delivered through the system.
1,7391,1792,7383,Or wider for marks air miles
1,7392,1782,7299,There are problems in some institutions that require them to make money to survive. NSLEC has to make money sell bed nights and charge for training Hydra has always been free or no added cost to NSLEC courses. With the changes in Centrex and the future organisation will this be allowed to continue
1,7393,1779,7383,....and how do you faciltate it effectively??
1,7394,1780,7293,Expansion needs to include expansion to different police audiences. Pressure is on for the use of immersive training to others, including probationers, through appropriately designed exercises is coming through. If Hydra is to remain the simulated environment of choice we mustn&#039;t be too protective by limiting its use to strategic decision-makers. Everyone loves it - as long as the exercises are designed as being fit for purpose.
1,7395,1775,7381,there is away around this think outside the box
1,7396,1783,7307,I&#039;m fed up with the lack of direction within force...The overuse of tick box training and the real issues are being swept over...There is a lack of engagement in quality training and the answer, so I&#039;m told is a powerpoint or a knowledge parcel.<br />Is this Training, or arse covering?
1,7397,1785,7308,enable streaming video and live video feed box
1,7398,1783,7385,Same crap different packaging
1,7399,1794,7295,I was under the impression that in terms of  occupational competence. Skills for Justice have indicated that &#039;Simulation&#039; was not generally accepted as a valid process?
1,7400,1775,7381,compresion of stored-arcived databases
1,7401,1796,7356,Tricky one to adhere to when instructed to create an inappropriate exercise...
1,7402,1784,7316,I disagree. We don&#039;t need Hydra Thought Police, we just need to understand immersive learning and use it properly. If the training need does not require immersive learning then use some other method.
1,7403,1776,7366,exercise development must be related to identified training needs.  This is bound to be different across forces which makes standardised development difficult
1,7404,1775,7308,compresion of stored-arcived databases
1,7405,1774,7309,Exercises can and are mapped through learning outcomes to the competency framework. This allows effective evaluation of the training. Then consider the recipient of the training which is a wholly different area.
1,7406,1795,7289,Debriefs are often done where the facilitator/debriefer is of a lesser rank or position than students.<br />this seems to skirt around the real issues brought up in the exercise. 10k would be an asset in this instance.
1,7407,1790,7379,could 10kv be permanently incorporated within hydra?
1,7408,1789,7332,10,000 volts debrief can sting transgressors but 50,000 volts from a taser really concentrates the mind
1,7409,1796,7288,Does immersive learning have a &#039;definition&#039;
1,7410,1774,7385,Where is Centrex disappearing to?
1,7411,1779,7288,Perpetual change is causing obsolescene before courses are ready for delivery...how can we get over this??
1,7412,1775,7288,what is the standard?
1,7413,1784,7325,Surely it is our job to educate them and assist them in the use of the tools which we provide.
1,7414,1781,7295,There needs to be two distinct routes on this subject. 1. If a course is not assessed and is a &#039;safe learning environment&#039; then the students should not be assessed or acredited in anyway. 2. If a course is &#039;designed&#039; to be used for the assessing of students then it must be made clear from the outset that this is the case.<br />Problems will occur when these two points are not clearly seperated and students get confused as to what they may be there for.
1,7415,1779,7360,The sting is in the tail - paying for it.
1,7416,1792,7339,They should initially be conversant with the subject matter, unless you have the funding for addittional SME&#039;s. The facilitator should also have an understanding of education/training. Otherwise they cannot possibly control a group in a manner that would be conducive to larning. This is the point that we enable students through experential learning, the facilitators must know wh	 that means.
1,7417,1786,7291,I think the learning can be improved upon by the debrief, but have seen this done too quickly not following the ELC model.
1,7418,1785,7305,explore the use of 3D sound, relevent ambient noise, altered lighting in pods, set dressed pods (pods placed inside control vehicles)
1,7419,1780,7308,an easy to use Communicator viewer to complement the Decision Log viewer would be really useful for tactical exercises. Please, please please rush me one ... money back if not delighted ...
1,7420,1779,7356,This then becomes a governance issue
1,7421,1783,7298,I want...No I need 10k as a debriefing tool for 2 reasons...1: Exercise Design 2: at the end of a Hydra exercise, to dig further into the issues, explore the real issues and develop a more knowledgable learner and team....We need to release 10kv out into the Hydra User Group....Just think what we can do and achieve
1,7422,1778,7394,Can we link  the simulation exercises used in initial training with the Hydra technology and meetthe volume demand?
1,7423,1775,7308,msc documents to be available on the client after printing from control
1,7424,1775,7363,duel screen maybe
1,7425,1774,7385,Isn&#039;t the NPIA an opportunity for the first time to streamline some of the archaic police training practices of dupication and actually give a sense of direction as to who should be trained, by whom when, how and why?
1,7426,1784,7411,Perpetual change probably means the we will never really get over this but, with foresight in design, the exercise should last. Some exercises have been running for several years with minor tweeks every so often.
1,7427,1790,7410,It ceases to exist next April and is replaced along with other agencies by NPIA
1,7428,1792,7403,The point is not the objectives or identified training needs it is the professional delivery of an immersive learning environment and exercise that needs governance
1,7429,1775,7308,comunicator viewer
1,7430,1781,7399,Simulation under certain competencies must me valid otherewise an student/officer/learner may never be fully competent if they have not come across a certain situation in the work place. However there are certain compentencies which are key and must only be achieved within the work place.
1,7431,1782,7305,It is not always necessary to have cutting edge simulation to immerse students, but the better the multimedia quality the better the allround experience. We should concentrate on creating a world for the student to interact with, making that world as believeable as possible. That should include every method we have available, Hydra, role play, live exercises, live telephone calls, interaction with the people they would expect to interact with in the way they would expect it, without asking them to compromise their ideals and suspend their reality
1,7432,1791,7394,Providing Hydra for recruits and for PC&#039;s/PCSO&#039;s on team, is something that probably most of us would love to see. However, the logistics would be a nightmare. The great thing about Hydra is the &#039;safe learning&#039; environment - which we must maintain. Increasing syndicate sizes (eg on a web based Hydra for large numbers) might jepordize the credibility of the Hydra name?????
1,7433,1774,7302,Is there a future for Hydra in the e-learning world?
1,7434,1778,7309,Might be useful to identify some lower level metrics, as the overall force performance metric will always be illusive
1,7435,1775,7308,who cotrols the upgrades to sites every where
1,7436,1779,7308,enable jpgs to be displayed session by session in the Local Area function as photos are currently done to provide scene maps etc
1,7437,1789,7293,London Olympic Committee 2012 - (pension enhancement plan number 27)
1,7438,1785,7414,So long as, during the design of the course, seperation is made by the trainers between the assesment element and the hydra / safe learning element there can be a blend
1,7439,1775,7288,are we all using the same version of hydra?
1,7440,1777,7291,Facilitators must have a good understanding of hydra as well as the subject matter and some short training exercise for them would be useful.
1,7441,1776,7325,Facilitators are there to bring out and develop the learning from the exercise irrespective of the tool used. Selection and assesment of facilitors is not a matter for us
1,7442,1778,7433,Is there a future for e-learning in the immersive learning world?
1,7443,1787,7406,10KV run as part of debrief would be very powerful - with input from the facilitators. Facilitators can be intimidated by higher rank students.
1,7444,1784,7382,We need to be empowered.
1,7445,1774,7421,Totally agree......this is a powerful tool to get at some of the real issues......handled correctly and facilitated with style and wisdom.
1,7446,1790,7411,Do we need to get over this, courses need to be constantly updated. Surely constant change means the courses are more dynamic and up to date
1,7447,1775,7302,can we link hydra to a web browser
1,7448,1781,7324,This would also give the opportunity for facilitors who want to be more hands on in the creation of a course to be able to do this, would help resiliance within the resourcing of a unit.
1,7449,1794,7307,Some of these issues above  also relate to Quality Control. Could the terms and conditions of he licence be more strictly enforced to ensure standards are met?
1,7450,1782,7435,The approach should be carefuly co-ordinated, managed and funded, who will do that
1,7451,1795,7418,pseudo pods have been used for years in the military environment to great effect but due to the physical size and structure of such a facility they were not useful for trainer facilitation, positioning of cameras and microphones.<br />you would then need to consider the ammount of time, effort and staffing demands to recreate the pod for each differing scenario
1,7452,1779,7348,What will be??
1,7453,1776,7406,Is rank a issue - as long as the facilitator has credibility in relation to the subject
1,7454,1783,7405,We evaluate but do nothing with the results..We all know when things have gone well and when things have gone wrong...Its just a managment safegaurd...How do you evalute the evaluation...Its offten only one persons opinion at level 3, and I have to question this persons knowledge in the Hydra techonology in the first place...When I&#039;m telling the evaluator how Hydra works, what th exercise is all about how can this be credible...How can you evalute the effect of a hydra event when often the evaluatotr does not even see the whole hydra simulation...This ROI not evaluation with any credibility.   Do you ever ask a member of the community to evaluate the outcomes.  NO....Nothing furhter
1,7455,1792,7320,Surely suitability and added value are the indicators as to Hydra or not, all other training methodologies are still applicable, just because Hydra is by far the most impactive, student preferred method does not mean it is right to be used
1,7456,1775,7410,to become NPT
1,7457,1779,7444,Oh please - we are just a bunch of techies and the pressure is being piled on by ACPO ranking officers. Get real.
1,7458,1777,7379,This would an effective addition to any hydra course
1,7459,1774,7288,The 10kv should be used to inform a National Training Strategy. It is not rocket science to see that this is probably the most effective tool in gaining real people&#039;s thoughts, views and importantly experience.
1,7460,1784,7401,We must not be instructed to use these tools inappropriately. No one would insist that interview training should be done by a driving instructor in a police car.
1,7461,1781,7363,There is full screen in syndicates!!  However this relies onthe students to click the right mouse button and select full screen. I believe this is new in version 6.
1,7462,1783,7405,NCF...NOS....Give it another 12 months and it will be something else....Lets stop the bus...Think about the strategy and focus on what we want to achieve...
1,7463,1775,7418,ala london fire i think you will find, you can do this your self, just bthink outside the box
1,7464,1795,7418,the use of ambient noise has recreated situations where the syndicates are placed in a sensory environment. a simple cd of traffic noise, crowds at events etc is ideal for this.
1,7465,1785,7463,and parametta australia
1,7466,1774,7442,There is already in terms of exercise pre-briefing so it wouldn&#039;t take much work.
1,7467,1779,7406,Agree with the above - credibility is far more important  in the eyes of the beholders than rank held, particularly if the person concerned is a &#039;Bramshill Wonder&#039;
1,7468,1777,7354,It may mean that students are less likely to test out taking risks in the safe environment
1,7469,1796,7308,See what everyone else has done to H to make it more user friendly and integrate those functions into the next version. If we are adapting H for our use, then thats the way it needs to be developed not, having some one elses ideas forced on us.
1,7470,1778,7293,Could we establish some core purposes linked to the wider policing objectives to govern expansion in the first instance?
1,7471,1792,7350,Should someone, NPIA or better still Jonathans team not be given this as a role to be performed. Properly funded and supported. There does need to be some centralised officially recognised HQ
1,7472,1775,7436,give a print button to the info held in the local area
1,7473,1781,7365,Add the subtitles to your video when creating this. Then select full screen video in the syndicate room when viewing the video.
1,7474,1775,7308,give a print button to the info held in the local area
1,7475,1791,7289,In helping to develop new exercises, the 10Kv system is an excellent tool for starting to discover what people really want to learn during a Hydra exercise. Part of the Hydra TNA process should be to use 10kv to understand people&#039;s frustrations and needs.
1,7476,1778,7371,or both?
1,7477,1779,7476,But Centrex is being abolished
1,7478,1785,7418,there is also the posability of subsonic infra sound and subliminal sound feeds to alter the emotional state, potentially vastly increasing the experience
1,7479,1776,7375,I think assesment should be done later in the workplace.  immersive simulation will give most students an indicator of where they may need further development and this can be best done in the workplace under the supervision of a mentor or experience officer
1,7480,1783,7326,A totally agree!...This is were it all falls down...Don&#039;t let the technology rule...We focus on the Plenary and the learning here...Very little technology here, just good strong facilitation is required...
1,7481,1774,7340,Every Hydra exercise - properly designed and facilitated - should be a team building event which is an intended learning outcome, as far as I am concerned although the subject matter mind vary.
1,7482,1795,7447,how would the use of internet linked Hydra suites be secured, would the data links all be the same quality. how would you debrief a multi-site exercise.
1,7483,1796,7289,How wpould the debriefer integrate learning models etc in a 10K debrief?
1,7484,1781,7364,This is very true and would come under the &#039;CONs&#039; list.
1,7485,1791,7379,We do this after the SMoCIT exercise, with great success. It&#039;s also an ideal tool for honest feedback after any Hydra exercise
1,7486,1775,7296,the hydra version should  work if treated carefully
1,7487,1779,7459,Greater availability  of 10Kv would be possibly the most effective tool that ncalt could give us both for operational and training use, there seems to be a trust issue here though?
1,7488,1784,7457,We are so much more than &#039;just a bunch&#039; of anything and, scarey as it maybe, you are involved in immersive learning so you must have a whole range of wonderful skills as well as your technical ability. Be proud of yourself!
1,7489,1789,7359,done beta testing now
1,7490,1778,7459,Probably the most efficient also but does the immeriev learning team want to become part of the Training Needs Analysis team?
1,7491,1791,7362,1000% agree
1,7492,1776,7455,True but who should actually make that decision
1,7493,1775,7476,or will it be npia
1,7494,1780,7375,If the facilitators have the appropriate experience and credibility they could prevent someone who has demonstrated a lack of understanding or poor decision making in Hydra going out to make those poor decisions on serious investigations. It&#039;s an assessment or judgement call on their part, but so much of critical decision making involves judgement calls - no experienced consultant SIO would surely allow someone who is patently not up to it to go out and compromise investigations without pointing this out to line management? So that&#039;s an assessment - but can we develop a framework for this?
1,7495,1779,7440,Why?? That&#039;s what we are there for
1,7496,1783,7418,Some great ideas here, but it all comes down to direction and funding....You can&#039;t do this in isolation...These things need national direction and design....To be honest, apart from the use of Hydra for police drivers, why would you need to use control vehicles, ligthing, etc...
1,7497,1796,7296,What are the differences  between the 2 for the student.
1,7498,1794,7379,Would this also enable students to &#039;self reflect&#039; or I hate to use the word &#039;self assess&#039; various elements of the exercise. I know that some would use 10kv for this purpose!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,7499,1792,7367,Self assessment with a final meeting with a mentor/course facilitator that recommends further training if needed without sanction to the persons career or post would be difficult and costly to administer. NCPE have tried it out, it was well supported and accepted by the students but took a lot of energy from the training team. This should form part of an ongoing project with wider consultation. I firmly believe that if we get the trainers/facilitators in the rquired numbers then this will work, I also believe that we will do it on a shoe string and therefore it would be a limited use execise
1,7500,1791,7295,The &#039;A&#039; word and Hydra should never be used in the same sentence - its that simple.
1,7501,1785,7337,if we generate better service to the public by improving the intangables such as attitude, behaviour and diversity then are we not generating something more valuable than money ?
1,7502,1774,7431,Utopian ideal which may lose sight of how appropriate is the methodology for what I am trying to train?This loops back to exercise development and a thorough understanding of adult learning processes. I have run immersive learning exercises on a &#039;paper feed&#039; only.
1,7503,1778,7289,Are we making enough/any use of the learning from debriefing?
1,7504,1795,7305,the use of real injects ie telephone calls into the syndicates eg. press officer, coroner etc. increases the exposure of the student to the reality of the situation. taking it further the use of real media students to bring real pressure to bear. the resulting media products can then be fed back into the syndicate or training team to qualify the message being passed out into the real world.
1,7505,1782,7295,We are always assessing ourselves in all the things we do, the step to self assesment in Hydra is the most obvious one to take, it safeguards our need to provide a safe learning environment and allows us as an organisation to keep a check on the abilities of the students without compromising Hydra ethics. We have all seen students go through a Hydra exercise and think to ourselves how poorly they performed and worry that the student has been promoted to their level of incompitence
1,7506,1789,7378,ready very soon
1,7507,1784,7349,Yes. Count me in.
1,7508,1776,7349,What qualifies this group to QA material to be used for courses?
1,7509,1779,7299,There will also be a problem with those organisations that do not have such pressures as they will not be abe to understand the situation that others are in, and this may lead to marginalisation.
1,7510,1791,7482,Over the internet with 10Kv
1,7511,1780,7330,is there any academic research on this that is appropriate to Hydra?
1,7512,1773,7464,this is where minerva started from the simulation of football and nottinghill carnival, the power of sound is huge, but the design has to be right, the fast time exercises around team decsion making within public order scenaros is where audio is so important
1,7513,1778,7498,Are we making enough/any use of the learning from debriefing?
1,7514,1775,7374,trained support staff who assist in the delivery of short hydra exercises where time can not be spent traing the students to use the system
1,7515,1791,7425,wasn&#039;t this why centrex was formed?
1,7516,1776,7356,The hydra team can advise on the appropriateness but if the bosses want it done.................
1,7517,1785,7441,ah, but how much easier life would be if you could get rid of the ones who refuse to listen, and how much better that would be for the students !
1,7518,1775,7417,should facilitators be trained trainers?
1,7519,1778,7399,Only matters if you want to get an NVQ
1,7520,1781,7291,More specific training in areas of creating material for a hydra exercise. What is the best video codecs to use? Are jpegs better than bmp files? What are the limitations. What shouldn&#039;t be done and what is best practice.
1,7521,1779,7436,and a print button for the photos. BTW can we have intelligent windows for photos and maps to re-size rather that having to fiddle about converting original images??
1,7522,1796,7299,Do we need a better central register of exercises, if its on the ncalt site then its awful to get on from some forces systems so, falls into disuse.
1,7523,1792,7497,The methodolgy if run correctly is totally different. They both require the same degree of attention to realistic detail to ensure immersion, the students then work in real time inside minerva, with hydra we have time outs. It could not be given justice here but perhaps it should go into the training section as a requirement/need. Having  heared the hendon team John and Andy explain it, it was fascinating
1,7524,1785,7507,there appears to be air miles here
1,7525,1781,7291,We have a manual on how to use Hydra, how about a step by step guide for how to create material for a hydra exercise.
1,7526,1784,7487,&#039;most effective tool&#039;... surely it will not cover every training need! It is another tool in our box and we need a range of spanners for all the different nuts out there.
1,7527,1783,7392,Then the problem should be dealt with not compounded....Charging for the use of facilities is fine and a reasonable decision, but when this moves to charging for a hydra course and tragets are set, I&#039;m not going to share my materials with anyone else if it will effect my income target and hence my appraisal, which leds to persoanl failure...Here&#039;s where we loose the effetiveness of collaboration
1,7528,1773,7307,remember the ownership of Hydra and Minerva is the Met. Police, the users are licensed it has no connection with the centrex or the NPIA world, the new world will have to acknowledge this.  For this reason Hydra is safe from political malipulation the Met, has not nor ever will dictate the use other than quality issues
1,7529,1782,7309,Who evaluates the ntof the home office and its self appointed quangos.Are we trying to please a master that doesn&#039;t know what it wants. It is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of Hydra training through the usual (cost effective method) Try following a student for 6 months after a course and see if they demonstrate a number of cleverly created and justifyable tick box emotions and actions
1,7530,1795,7322,how would this improve the experience for the student. or are you trying to overwhelm them.
1,7531,1775,7365,you have lost the point of the boxes
1,7532,1780,7505,This goes to the key area of committed facilitators who have credibility in their field - ideally designing and leading exercises, not handing this over to others. They safeguard the levels of competence required by the students and will always judge whether individuals have gone below the required standard, whether formally or informally.
1,7533,1774,7528,If that is the case why hasn&#039;t it done so already?
1,7534,1784,7524,Never entered my head. Just thinking about preseving the ethos of immersive learning and gaining expertese myself. I don&#039;t care where i do it.
1,7535,1779,7518,Not neccessarily - I think it&#039;s a personality thing, some of them are naturals and others will never be able to do it well
1,7536,1773,7436,this is a feature already in the system please ask JJ to explain how to use this
1,7537,1795,7322,nearly every graphics card out there will only support video on the primary monitor, you could use a Y cable to split the video feed to two separate plasma or monitor screens.
1,7538,1781,7519,All courses will eventually be backed by Universities as NVQs etc. This is part of the governments idea of gaining qualifications whilst in the work force
1,7539,1775,7419,with a single comunication print
1,7540,1783,7529,Point well made and why the Centrex QA process should be put in the dustbin...Why did Centrex build a QA model when BSI had one on the shelf in the first place...Empire creation!
1,7541,1773,7536,not the resize though - that is true
1,7542,1782,7388,What would the techies do then to make themselves feel more superior
1,7543,1787,7316,surely it can be left up to an individual site to make the most of it&#039;s Hydra investment.  Will it really reflect nationally on the Hydra brand if there is a (unintentional) less than perfect use by someone&#039;s standard ?
1,7544,1784,7508,I was thinking more about QA the implementation of the methodologies rather that the course material.
1,7545,1775,7291,when will there be a hand book
1,7546,1785,7495,you can lead a horse to water but cannot force it to drink, some people are blinkered by rankism and / or antiquated methodologies and need a kicking in different ways before coming into the fold. any method of increasing the speed of their adoption of good techniques should be tried / used
1,7547,1779,7384,The reference point is increasingly Skills for Justice I&#039;m afraid
1,7548,1782,7502,I agree that paper feeds are not irrelivant in training, but ask a student what they prefer, quite often you will find the more fun the more learning
1,7549,1778,7538,But lots of learning will always be developmental rather than specifically assessed
1,7550,1774,7309,We cannot avoid the fact that we are in a world and a future where YOU will have to justify your Hydra training and &#039;prove&#039; it is effective in competing for funds and resources. To deny this is sand and head burying. We need to be more open, and this links with QA/QC that what is developed is at least &#039;sound&#039;.
1,7551,1791,7431,Come and see the Negotiators siege exercse at Hendon for immersion using &#039;live&#039; inputs!
1,7552,1784,7500,But do you know why?
1,7553,1783,7295,ANYONE USING HYDRA FOR ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE USER GROUP AND HAVE THEIR LICENCE WITHDRAWN...ASSESSMENT WILL BRING DOWN HYDRA! (yes I am shouting!)
1,7554,1789,7409,according to Jacques Yves Cousteau it means jumping in and not being afraid to get your feet or hair wet !<br />anyone who has seen the most cynical of students &quot;sucked in&quot; to a hydra exercise the moment the first information comes up on the syndicate sceen will not worry about definitions
1,7555,1786,7459,does it capture emotions ?
1,7556,1781,7500,The &#039;A&#039; word being? Assessment? Accreditation? Analysing? Surely there is different levels which need to be fully explored. Nothing is that black and white?
1,7557,1773,7503,this is a key question and we need to think of ways to get analysis back into design JC
1,7558,1776,7505,The difficulty with self assessment is the requirement to be honest with yourself and we all know that there are many people who think they are doing just fine when it is blatantly apparent to all around them that they are not.
1,7559,1780,7505,Hydra would be such a useful environment to highlight individuals who display poor group-working, information management and communication as well as allowing them to demonstrate their levels of knowledge and ability to apply that knowledge. The exercise leaders may not have a formal checklist to &#039;assess&#039; against, but so much of the exercises are based around making judgements and decision making, it is right that the exercise leaders use THEIR judgement on the students&#039; performance. That is an assessment, surely?
1,7560,1784,7553,Yes, but do they know why??? Should we, in a calm and gentle voice, explain the methodologies to ourselves?
1,7561,1779,7487,No, what I meant was that 10Kv is not just a training tool where as Hydra, M inerva and E-Learning all are. The scope for the effective use of 10Kv is massive, far, far more than any of the others and I would really really like to have it at my disposal. I can think of any number of operations that I have been involved with that would have benefitted from a proper, frank debrief and that&#039;s before we start talking about using it for debriefing exercises.
1,7562,1794,7503,I would suggest - No. When do the teams from across the country who actually run the exercises get together to debrief a case study. We are all doing it a different way and to differing standards. Effective case scenario bebriefs would also contribute to the overall enhancment of HYDRA.
1,7563,1778,7553,Perhaps you are shouting because this matters and whatever the outcome needs a more informed debate?
1,7564,1792,7510,And Video conferencing, If you had a facilitator in each class, class split into syndicates, different classes in different locations and a facilitator co-ordinator this could be done. You would run the normal in house sessions and then take the outcome from each seperate location and with the co-ordination facilitator bring the learning from all sites into all site. May be a bit unworldly but with carefull planning, good tuition of the individuals concerned in the running of the exercise would a nmber of things. Bring immersive learning to the masses, make for some real joined up thinking across different boundaries. You could train a number ofdifferent roles within an incident seperately and then bring them all together for joint understanding
1,7565,1783,7553,Hydra is about an environment where...&quot;I can try something and if it works talk about it...as well as...Trying something, and if it fails, I can talk about that also without the burden of failure
1,7566,1787,7329,also - make the number of syndicates dispayed configurable.  Half of left screen is wasted if only running with 3 syndicates
1,7567,1781,7553,What about the different areas of assessment, accreditation, analysing? Surely until we have looked into all the different areas this refers to we can not just say yes or no! WHAT IS ASSESSMENT?
1,7568,1774,7414,There should be no confusion. Hydra should not be used as an &#039;assessment centre&#039; this will irrevocably alter the students perception and &#039;skew&#039; any so called &#039;findings&#039;.
1,7569,1778,7522,How does/ can the MLE support Hydra for forces?
1,7570,1775,7537,then put hydra on the second screen, dont be negative
1,7571,1791,7504,Presumably you&#039;ve seen SMoCIT?
1,7572,1783,7560,If they don&#039;t they need to wake up and smell the coffee!
1,7573,1789,7338,only if they are based abroad and Ican fly from Stansted (easy distance from Newmarket)
1,7574,1779,7490,No, but we should not shirk our responsibilties in helping provide the most effective tool to those whose job it is to prepare TNAs in order to make them more meanigful, as this eventually will come full circle and feed back into the courses that we are tasked to prepare
1,7575,1785,7461,firstly thsi methodology has not been explained   secondly this should be automatic not optional to increase the oomph of a feed.   By asking someone to actively alter the presentation you surely pop the bubble of immersion
1,7576,1775,7537,we do that any way not quite the same as having a full screen view
1,7577,1796,7523,Its just a case of using one system in different ways, the skills of the operators are the deciding factor, not the software.<br />&#039;Time outs&#039; are obligatory.
1,7578,1779,7555,It can do - is that a bad thing?
1,7579,1774,7414,Students are &#039;observed&#039; in a non-threatening and &#039;remote&#039; way so it is possible to give personal feedback on what was observed - not an assessment or conclusion of what they did, but observed behaviour. It is useful that way.
1,7580,1795,7366,the creation of an exercise is down to supply and demand but how are other Simulated Operations units to be made aware that an exercise is currently being produced by &#039;X&#039;. there is currently only a small number of cross unit traffic.<br />are commanders aware what is being created in their own force let alone externally. it would appear not!
1,7581,1791,7391,and Jim&#039;s!
1,7582,1783,7567,NO, we know why Hydra works and why assessment is bad in Hydra...We also know that assessment is good in the right environemtn...So lets use assessment as it should be used (Outside Hydra) and leave the concept of Hydra alone, where we have proved over time that it works...Why does the Police service always want to corrupt a good idea and over use it...
1,7583,1775,7575,use dual screen
1,7584,1779,7320,It should be business driven, but moderated by us. Once the dog has seen the rabbit it doesn&#039;t  need any more encoragement - we need to be the brakes, not the engine
1,7585,1781,7549,And this will form part of the overall training of an induvidual who will eventually achieve some sort of qualification. Whether they realised at the time that it actually is helping them achieve that. On this basis Hydra training/learning will need to bear that in mind.
1,7586,1791,7421,Far better than &#039;threads&#039; on a web site - more interactive, powerful, instant and immense fun
1,7587,1782,7550,Fortunately there are people with vision and guts that can see that something is right. They don&#039;t need a finacial breakdown or cost per student. They can see the value in Hydra by watching it and appreciating the learning that takes place. When the person with the vision is a leader, they wil find the money and the training will take place. Until the bean counters find out of course.
1,7588,1773,7553,lets have some honesty here! who is using Hydra as an assessment tool, speak up and justify the damage you are doing
1,7589,1776,7504,I like this idea, many students comment that they would like the opportunity to talk to the people they are dealing with rather than use the communicator - however one of the difficulties with this is keeping it consistant across the different syndicates
1,7590,1778,7309,Is the trick is to make evaluation and quality assuarnce quite light  touch but systematic?
1,7591,1794,7342,A great idea, but lets try it first in our own back yard. There has been a dream for several years to have the Management of Link and Series Crime operating at various sites across the UK,involving the police and other agencies. The technology is out there. Lets make it work here first, then it can be rolled out internationally.
1,7592,1782,7429,Yes we need one
1,7593,1785,7531,the point of the boxes is to tell the students where they are and who is talking to them and why, information and context.   Outside the hydra environment this is given to the on films and TV by use of on screen titles and sub title.   Many people watch over 2 hours of TV a night, this evironment is real to them   Is it not better to adopt a present/ current reality that is in common use rather than impose our own that has historical interest only
1,7594,1779,7441,So why not have a HUG list of &#039;approved facilitators&#039; across the board. Is there any reason why a Met DAC can&#039;t facilitate a Customs course (please?) or vice-versa? Facilitation is as much about people skills - JC&#039;s emotional intelligence - as it is about intimate subject knowledge
1,7595,1775,7553,we turn prospective customers away who whant assesment, its not on
1,7596,1776,7396,It&#039;s arse covering - which is what 90% of training seems to be about these days
1,7597,1784,7553,If you understand the methodologies of Hydra and Minerva you would not consider using them for assessment in the same way that you don&#039;t apply the brakes when you want to move forward. That doesn&#039;t mean that assessment can not be used on a course in which Hydra is a part.
1,7598,1782,7469,Agreed, this is the right place to choose the new functionality. Let us decide what we want.
1,7599,1774,7553,You don&#039;t need to shout but a reasoned debate about and understanding of what is and is not being &#039;assessed&#039; is needed. Observed behaviour brought to the attention of a student is developmental. Surely that&#039;s what we are trying to do? Hydra and Minerva&#039;s origins are in &#039;games playing&#039; but it&#039;s a bit more serious than that isn&#039;t it?
1,7600,1792,7550,Then apply the same evaluation techniques as ordinary boring class based learning. Provided that it is more than a check test examination which generally only test the students ability to regurgitate written word, it does not always test the understanding. I am sure most of us have set some exams and will agree they are generally a matter of rote learning
1,7601,1779,7349,No. You&#039;re thinking with your pointy hat on again. There are other users apart from the police - are you confident that you can accurately and meaningfully assess their methodologies, let alone thier content??
1,7602,1780,7295,It is naive to expect Command Teams not to want to ensure that an expensive facility like a Hydra suite isn&#039;t used as much as possible, including just using Hydra to deliver video clips as part of an assessment centre type approach. Will those persons who go through such an assessment centre subsequently equate the Hydra suite with assessment? Surely not - professional staff should be given more credit than that. Also, we don&#039;t want to reach the stage when Command Teams start looking at other simulated tools instead of Hydra which don&#039;t come with the service-based approach, but with a profit-based methodology?
1,7603,1775,7308,view, amend and print tasks via document control
1,7604,1796,7589,Yes, on one exercise a picture was shown of a PC outside a crime scene, the student(senior officer) asked via Communictor for that PC to come and speak to them !!!. Tricky one to facilitate...
1,7605,1791,7584,good one
1,7606,1783,7550,Why do we have to prove anything...Is it not about providing quality effectine learning?...I (we) don&#039;t have to do anything...The purpose of quality systems is to ensure that the product that was design meets its specification, and that anything substandard is identified...If this is the case then why are we not embrasing Hydra and stopping some of the old training methods that are still being used to date...Do a QA on the Hydra concept, and move on...Or did I forget about the HMIC inspection that has already recommended Hydra a the future and that of ggod practice....How many times do you need to QA.....Happy sheets are a waste of time anyway
1,7607,1792,7577,Bit simplicistic i believe
1,7608,1778,7553,Who should be having this discussion? Are we the right people to make this decision?
1,7609,1785,7308,ensure the jpg / mpg window is always a standard window size not a jumble of numbers picked out of the air
1,7610,1795,7506,the light has come on
1,7611,1781,7582,Again thats black &amp; White. What if an induvidual clearly needs further training in a certain area that may have become apparent during a hydra exercise. Could a facilitator not monitor that (gives them a &#039;heads up&#039; so to speak) so that later on when that induvidual is still undertaking training within a different area that is not within hydra. The facilitator can help focus the training for that induvidual into the key areas which need improving?
1,7612,1794,7375,If people are complying to the concept of the new SIO development programme. The workplace assessment should be completed before then attend the HYDRA simulation. This would ensure that HYDRA is NOT USED for assessemnt purposes.
1,7613,1773,7599,this is a little patronising! the philosophy is based around complexity &#039;games playing&#039; belittles that complexity and deisgn a lot of thinking has gone into self assessment and not turning hydra into a assessment centre
1,7614,1782,7606,I like happy sheets they make me feel good
1,7615,1774,7608,If we can&#039;t discuss this then who else is qualified to?
1,7616,1773,7602,no no no no
1,7617,1784,7497,The fact that this question has been asked absolutely justifies my arguement that we need to fully understand what we have got before we try to use it. We need to understand the methodologies. I think the number of people who really understand is very small (possible only one if you really think about it - has anyone read his thesis???)
1,7618,1775,7298,if hydra gets over used it will become like &quot;death by powerpoint&quot; has become a turn off
1,7619,1773,7602,leave assessment centres out of the equation altogether Assessment is not learning Hydra is
1,7620,1795,7380,the minimum specifications for hydra upgrades needs to be looked at.<br />are all components of windows xp, 2000, word,etc current and compatable with the latest version of Hydra.
1,7621,1779,7553,I agree but I am a realist. All of our organisations need assessment for various purposes. Hydra is - or could be - the best way of doing it. If we don&#039;t let them use Hydra they will use something not as good. Is that what you want? I also think it is naive to think that students perfomance on Hydra will not be revisited in the event of a Public Enquiry or simiar where the competence of a student that had attended a Hydra event became an issue

1,7623,1791,7289,I can understand JC wishing to be careful how/where/when 10KV is used - but perhaps a &#039;10Kv lite&#039; version (say, 5Kv) could be designed for wider use with Hydra?

1,7625,1778,7295,The SIO Programme incorporates Immersive Learning and other types of learning but SIOs are then assessed later against NOS in the workplace as result of the overall course. Thus th I/L is allowed to be developmental but still linked to assessment
1,7626,1776,7594,For the students it all centres around the  credibility of the facilitator - this approach may work but there is a large probability that students will not take to being facilitated by someone from outside the job
1,7627,1781,7597,Your last sentance here I think is very true and where people are getting confused about assessment. Using assessment on course which includes Hydra (but the induvidual is not assessed on the Hydra Exercise), can help give facilitators the opportunity of helping induviduals in acheiving the assessment criteria.

1,7635,1780,7439,the version of Hydra is not the arbitor of quality control. It&#039;s not the tools you have but what you do with them. Consider the financial conditions that some Hydra sites across the country contend with on a daily basis - or do you run the risk of pushing those sites towards pure income generation to continually upgrade equipment? Surely not to be recommended.
1,7636,1774,7604,Not really it is time then to ask the student what do you want to know?
1,7637,1791,7500,i don&#039;t believe Hydra should be used to assess individuals who&#039;ve taken part in a Hydra exercise. Hydra can be assessed as a learning tool, but...
1,7638,1785,7431,There is always the danger here of the staff being immersed and the students getting lost
1,7639,1779,7602,We have had students attending Hydra events who have been assessed both internally and externally for a series of jobs including overseas postings. They have all said that the Hydra course was better, more demanding and more appropriate than a 48 hour live roleplay. One has since been active in trying to get Hydra to replace the current system. Would this be so very bad??!!
1,7640,1775,7309,should we have an evaluation arm of the system
1,7641,1792,7604,No it isn&#039;t, it is different to facilitate . This is where a thorough briefing of the use of the communicator will overcome this issue, if the delegates are told that should they need to ask any questions of a specific individual this should be done through the communicator. The control team must then in real time obtain appropriate response, this could be done in written statements etc. What ever response it should be in the manner the delegates would expect. If in reality they would personally debrief the individual then that is what should be done, if in most cases it nwould be tasked to another then that is what is requireds.<br />This is obviously a training implicationa nd goes to my issue about not understanding what Immersive learning is about perhaps.

1,7687,1798,7681,There is always a struggle/conflicit between speed and accurancy.  Our society is demanding faster and faster results--get everything done in less than an hour.  The reality is that life and investigations is much messier and takes longer.
1,7688,1811,7677,Taking the time to really assess the process we went through and breaking down things we could have done better so that we have lessons learned for the next time.
1,7689,1800,7678,In this case the truth of what happened seemed obvious from the video.  What we never learned, and I doubt that we ever will, is why it happened.  Was is the environment at Southeast or specific to this group of officers?
1,7690,1798,7685,Political considerations drove only the speed of the case Not the outcome BUT many people will not believe that.  Thus, many officers believe that political considerations dictated that the officer involved was fired.
1,7691,1808,7679,Who ultimately owns the case?  There were issues within PSB regarding who was going to be held accountable for meeting the timeline and goals that were set for us by outsiders.
2,7692,0,0,communication between the investigators and the advocates
1,7693,1799,7678,Making sure that the investigation is complete and all leds are investigated.
1,7694,1808,7678,The motto of IA is the truth of the matter.  Inthis case I think that we met that obligation.
1,7695,1801,7680,In this case there was no way to make both sides of this issue happy, if outcome (punishment) was the focus.  It is important to focus both internally and externally on the process not the outcome.  I believe that is the only way we can hope to have any symblance of trust from both.
1,7696,1797,7692,Was there a rush to judgement prior to the BOR hearings?  Was the decision of the board made in the best interest of the dept or the public?
1,7697,1811,7683,Ensuring the integrity of the investigators.  This was an emotional case, with enormous pressure but it was incumbent upon us to ensure all evidence was gathered, as well as all information properly recorded so an independent assessment of the incident could take place and we were fair to all the stakeholders involved.
1,7698,1808,7684,you can&#039;t run an inv of this magnitude without realizing there will be o/s pressure.
1,7699,1815,7678,Much of what we (LAPD) hold as `truth` amounts to verbal accounts of what happened. This often bears little or no resemblance to the truth and is filled with subjectivity and bias.
1,7700,1798,7680,Trust is elusive in these events.  The community is not one set of answers or opinions.  Rather, it ranges from some segments that think we did not beat the suspect enough to those who think we were brutal vs those who think the actions were criminal and the only acceptable outcome is that the officers be immediately arrested and thrown in jail.<br />There is also an element within the department that believes that no cop in a critical incident can make a mistake that should result in discipline.
1,7701,1810,7680,thoroughness and need to act, sometimes quickly, may conflict with the need to take our time and fully examine an event. The public needs to understand that the lack of overt or obvious action on our part doesn&#039;t equate with no action. brief the public as we proceed but don&#039;t rush the investigation to please them.
1,7702,1800,7677,I think we did a lot of things right and can take what we learned to the next major case.  Videotaping of interviews should be the rule, not the exception.
1,7703,1809,7685,But for the video, displaying the way it looks when an officer strikes a suspect, there would no have been a hue and cry for the officer&#039;s termination.  Would he have been terminated under the same circumstances if the story was reported in print, and not in video?
1,7704,1811,7685,We need to remain removed from any pressure or perceptions on the part of politicians.  We need to remain an independent investigative body who seeks out the truth of what happened regardless of what might be the wishes of the politicians for the results
1,7705,1808,7680,Interesting trying to balance what are obviously conflicting demands.  There will always be those outside the org that will seocnd guess us no matter what we do.  We certainly have the ability tto heave more impact on the trust of our own people.
1,7706,1799,7692,making sure that there is open communication, and we were all on the same page.
1,7707,1798,7686,The discipline was tailored to the various parties very carefully BUT there are very few people involved in this case or that look at this case that see that.
1,7708,1810,7677,Too many times I suspect that the &quot;organizational learning&quot; that takes place occurs within divisions or bureaus - there is much to be learned from sharing this learning outside of the workgroup immeidately affected.
1,7709,1801,7692,This case was the first time we had an associate advocate involved (monitoring) interviews of accused officers at the front-end of the investigation.  I think we could have done a better job of identifying roles and strategy.  Specifically, we should have had a plan to break at a specified time and so that the investigators and advocate could discuss the interview and make additions or adjustments if necessary.
1,7710,1809,7677,What have we actually changed, with respect to striking a suspect, that was not in place before?
1,7711,1808,7683,If you lose your objectivity in these casesyou are toast.   But there were times in this inv where the objectivity of some of the players was impacted.
1,7712,1811,7681,There is a fine line here.  Quality cannot be compromised but we need to ensure that all steps are taken methodically and in whatever time frame will allow us to be thorough without languishing.
1,7713,1799,7683,Reporting the facts, and not become bias during the investigation.
1,7714,1797,7685,The final decision and the case was very political and satisfied the community.
1,7715,1800,7692,In Hatfield&#039;s board, the problem was not communicating to the board members.  They got it.  The problem was the perception of hostility between the investigators and advocates.  What was perceived as hostility was, I think, resentment.
2,7716,0,0,internal perceptions of the investigation
1,7717,1810,7690,The faster the investigation, the greater the likelihood that errors can take place or that valuable information may be missed. In this fashion, political influence can be detremental.
1,7718,1798,7696,\not sure what this means? Are you suggesting the Board pre-judged this case?  Interesting because this was a &quot;defense&quot; board.<br />No one expected the first officer to be fired but that outcome should have been expected IF you listened to the testimony of the Board and the rationale.
1,7719,1801,7692,Because the joint interview was a first, we (management) should have done a better job explaining why the advocates were involved.  By not doing so, I believe that we may have sent a message to the investigators that we did not have total confidence in them.  That couldn&#039;t be further from the truth, but I think we may have sent that message to some degree.
1,7720,1808,7685,When management looks at a case of this magnitude they have to recognize that there will be consequences for what ever the outcome is.  In this case people recognized early onthe high visibility of his case andstayed true to the mission:  the truth of the matter.
1,7721,1811,7692,Actually, communication between more than the investigators and the advocates is essential.  There were key people that needed to be updated and the better the communication, the better the investigation, because there is always someone who thinks of something no one else did.
1,7722,1815,7681,Timeliness does not necessarily imply that the investigation must be `rushed` in a fashion that detracts from the quality. We are so urgency driven in our organization that we believe we function at our best when we are driven by extremes and not by our own sense of diligence.
1,7723,1799,7686,Making sure the penalty fits the allegation if found guilty.
1,7724,1800,7710,After Rodney King, it became commonplace to carry a large flashlight instead of a baton.  This incident changed that practice.
1,7725,1797,7679,The criminal, admin, advocate, staff, dept experts were all involved and at times the mission and goals were not set nor clear or specific.
1,7726,1798,7711,I agree and it became the responsibility of management to move or remove people because of their opinions or biaises as these became clear.
2,7727,0,0,is there a role for community advisors/ representatives in these type of investigations?
1,7728,1801,7686,Those involved in this (in any role) must remember that the Chief of Police is the ultimate disciplinarian, not us.  We should not get upset if punishment is not what we think it should have been.
1,7729,1808,7716,Well many people within the Department think that the outcome was predetermined.  We know it wasn&#039;t, in fact the decission involving Hatfield was different that what most of us thought that it would be.  But based on past training regarding if the COP sends an officer to a BOR he believes it warrants termination, that message got out there.
1,7730,1810,7697,Investigators who are not aware of their own emotional reaction to cases run the risk of being unduly, and unconscously affected by the case - this could alter the investigation(?)
1,7731,1815,7683,Objectivity is a worthy goal that tends to fluctuate during the course of an investigation. A good investigator keeps checking himself for unintended bias throughout the investigation and asks other to help him in this regard.
1,7732,1798,7715,Assuming you are correct, what did they resent? Why?  They were partners in the same case with different roles, roles that should support and compliment not conflict.
1,7733,1797,7692,The understanding that crim is not privy to admin info, but advocates were and presented the case, quite confusing.
1,7734,1811,7716,The key word here is &quot;perceptions&quot;, which manifests itself, not only in this investigation, but in our everyday processes.  Good communication, not only speaking but listening is essential to overcome the barriers that arise because of perceptions.  All to often people surmise or think they understand another persons meaning or intent and fail to clarify it.
1,7735,1808,7681,When the COP makes a committment it is on us to make it happen.  That was the outcome in this case, and the investigators delievered.  Due to the high level of review it got internally it was done right the first time.
1,7736,1809,7680,The community should hear that the officer&#039;s actions were excessive.  But to what degree, requiring what level of discipline?  The Department needs to display the courage to speak loudly and clearly that it never is pretty when an officer strikes a person; it is ugly.  That level of uglyness that inflames political elements in the community should not factor into an officer&#039;s punishment.  That would be an example of bias inconsistent with ethical law enforcement.
1,7737,1816,7731,how does he or she know that the advice they are getting is unbiased?
1,7738,1800,7711,We actually did that in the second round of interviews.  But it was a challenge to balance the rights of the officers with the feelings of the investigators.  In the end, the right of the officers to have a fair investigation was more important than hurting someone&#039;s feelings.
1,7739,1810,7686,We have to be honest here - are we talking about discipline or punishment? If we mean discipline, then we want to help ensure the the same (or similar) behavior doesn&#039;t happen in the future. In this case, it is also critical that the findings and recommendations are shared on both an individual level (with the individual) and with others in the organization.
1,7740,1808,7708,But was this case handled correctly by the division from its inception?  Was it truly a categorical UOF or was it a non-cat?  What type of learning took place on that isue.
1,7741,1798,7677,A core learning was that perception is more important than reality.  Many of the investigators with the greastest knowledge of the case felt that Hale was the worst guy, not Hatfield.  BUT the public perception was that Hatfiled, as the guy swinging the flashlight, was the worst and when he was fired, that ended the case for the public with a perception that justice was done.
1,7742,1808,7684,Did that happen here...I don&#039;t thinkso.
1,7743,1811,7727,At some point yes but with the way things are in LA with some individuals in the community, they will never be willing to be openminded about LAPD no matter how &quot;transparent&quot; we are. No investigation will ever be good enough, fast enough, etc.
1,7744,1797,7677,When the dept becomes involved in a highly publicized incident, rush to judgement or change in the policy takes place.
1,7745,1800,7703,With no video, there probably wouldn&#039;t have been a sustained allegation.  Makes you wonder about other &#039;not resolveds&#039;
1,7746,1801,7716,Investigators and advocates need to understand each others roles and recognize that at different points of the investigation and/or adjudication ownership and roles change.  During the investigation the advocates role is to support via advise and assistance (framing questions, allegations, etc.) and the investigators have primary ownership.  However, once the case goes to a Board of Rights the investigators need to shift to a support role and become an I/O, much like a homicide detective in a murder trial.<br />Most of our investigators are sergeants, and thus they are not as familiar with this concept as detectives are.  In this case, the detectives understood this better, and were less affected by the issues that arose between the investigators and the advocates.
1,7747,1808,7725,How did that happen?  With all fo the meetings we held and the belief that we run an open shop why wasn&#039;t this concern addressed
1,7748,1809,7701,The level of courage necessary to stand up to vocal elements in the community is sometimes rare.  We all know that telling the truth concerning the force officers use is a dangerous political trap.  The safe play is to avoid the issue, but our people deserve a higher level of fortitude from those in positions of power.
1,7749,1799,7680,Keep the officers and the community informed of the investigation.  However, keep in mind one side may not like the progress of the investigation.
1,7750,1808,7719,We may have missd the boat on that but who did we need to tell?  We had the LAPPL in early on and shared as much as we could have without compromising the inv.
1,7751,1800,7742,There was pressure, political and community, to get the case done.  But I don&#039;t think we allowed that to impact the quality of the investigation.
1,7752,1815,7716,No one in my 30 year history with the Department has done a better job than the current COP to mitigate &#039;perceptions&#039; by heading them off with the truth or at least bits of truth interspersed with direction and leadership objectives. Whatever fallout comes from the Miller is bound to be far less than it was with any previous COP.
1,7753,1801,7683,This is an area were we all need to be careful.  When we become actively involved in cases, it is easy to lose some of our objectivity, so we need to take a step back.  Additionally, we need to be careful not to take things such as witness/accused personnality conflicts to heart and strive to remain as objective as possible.
1,7754,1798,7727,And isn&#039;t that the core challenge?  How to change the public perception of the LAPD?  How to change the public&#039;s idea about the investigation  How to change the public&#039;s perception about the incident?  About the department?
1,7755,1808,7727,The COP kept now president of the Police Commission John Mack apprised of the status of the inv.  WHO ELSE DO WE BRING IN...dANNY bAKEWELL,  tONY mOHAMED?  tHISI S A TOUGH ISSUE.  (THIS ISN&#039;T A Ransom note)
1,7756,1815,7677,At what point can a confidential (personnel) investigation become an open book learning turtorial for others to use in a learning mode? There are considerations for privacy and protection that often stymie the best learning experience. Even if PSB members working here now learn something valuable, can they communicate this message to non-PSB members?
1,7757,1799,7677,Making sure all involved Department investigators and managers keep an open mind to suggestions no matter the rank.
1,7758,1808,7739,This is about noth.  Modifying behavior is the discipline piece and firing or suspension days is about the punishmnet piece.
1,7759,1797,7679,The decision on the type of UOF category had not been decided until the UOF was written almost a yr after the incident.  We had a UOF system in place and at one point because of the high profile incident, our dept took time to make the UOF decision.  No matter how highly publicized the incident was we need to keep with the system we have in place.
1,7760,1808,7704,How do we do that?  If there is so much pressure how can we control negative responses to it?  Didn&#039;t we fall victim to that ourselves?
1,7761,1801,7727,If our goal remains to focus on the &quot;process&quot; and not the &quot;outcomes&quot; then transparency in the investigation in more important than advisory, in my opinion.  When we bring in people from the community in an advisory capacity they bring all of their special interest luggage with them.
1,7762,1809,7741,If that is true, then leadership failed.  What greater responsibility could those in a position to address public issues have, then to clarify issues openly, irrespective of the potential political firestorm it could raise.
1,7763,1816,7743,do they have a place to ensure that the investigation remains objective and unbiased?
1,7764,1808,7756,We have an obligation to share what we learn.  PSB is more that just IA inv.
1,7765,1815,7686,I think our Department could benefit from the experience of connecting employees to their roles as community members and citizens with an expectation of responsiveness from their City government. So few Dept. employees live in the CIty that they don&#039;t experience it at all as citizens (or customers).
1,7766,1799,7727,Yes there is, but there role should be limited.  Also, they should be aware that there voice is very powerful in the community and can cause a problem if the wrong information is presented to the public.
1,7767,1800,7732,I struggled to find the right word, and maybe resentment was not it.  But I feel that the investigators did not feel appreciated or included by the advocates.  And the advocates felt a lack of support from the investigators.<br />Dare I say it?  Okay, I will.  Race was put out there as a causal element, but it was simply a fact of who the investigators were.  I could be wrong, but I don&#039;t think it was a real factor in the conflict, but an imagined one, perhaps drawn from the race differences from Hatfield and Miller.
2,7768,0,0,communication between the department and the wider LAPD
1,7769,1808,7768,Yes there was a lack of knowledge about what was happening.  Most C/Os did attend roll calls and discussed what happened.  But we at PSB can&#039;t share details while the case is active, except in a very general way.
1,7770,1801,7768,The COP recognized the importance of this issue and he immediately prepared a Code 20 video that was broadcast to the rank-and-file the same day.  Additionally, he placed his message on the Department Intranet.

1,7772,1808,7770,I must have missed that one
1,7773,1809,7768,The loudest message heard by officers who are out fighting with criminals today was that if their actions result in political pressure, the Department will not take on those challenges.  That is the message a street officer will speak in private, but not to a supervisor.  Whether true or not, that is how many feel.
1,7774,1801,7768,The COP was thoughtful with his remarks to the press, after this occured.  He did not overract by publicly condeming the officers, even thought there were those at the highest level who suggested that he do so.

1,7776,1808,7771,As soon as it was shown I knew it would have racial overtones.  That is one of the reasons it was so high profile so quickly.  Then add the Devon Brown shooting to the mix and the rest is history.
1,7777,1811,7768,This is very important especially after the impact that past high profile cases such as Eula Love and Rodney King have had on the workforce.  Some portion of information needs to be disseminated to the rest of the Department, especially those that perceive themselves as having the potential for being in the same situation.  Past regimes have handled things differently and the workforce needed to know what the message here was.  It was important for every commanding officer to address this with his/her workforce and be accessible to discuss it one to one.  As the situation and investigation unfolded things changed however, the initial video was imprinted on everyones mind as the story of what occurred.
1,7778,1800,7727,The community has its role as the civilian representative at the board.  When that started the officers thought the civilian board members would be the harshest.  Just the opposite proved to be true.
1,7779,1801,7771,The issue of race did come up during the issues raised between the advocates and the investigators, yet during the group meeting no one seemed to have the courage to bring it up.  It was mentioned in the hallway conversations, but was left unaddressed as if it never happened.  This is a process in which that discussion would have likely occured.
1,7780,1808,7775,Ah yes our friends in the media.  It certainly was interesting that we needed a subpoena to get the video from both stations so we could get to the truth of the matter.<br />Never lose sight of the fact that the media will do everything it can to kep an item like this is on the front page.
1,7781,1810,7779,Just look how we were hesitant to even suggest that this might be an issue to discuss in this format
1,7782,1811,7775,This became a very important aspect of this case due to the increased accessiblity of not only Department personnel but community groups and activists.  The media tends to not report facts or reports them with a spin and that has a huge impact on the workforce and its relationship with the community.
1,7783,1801,7771,By continually reminding the community that this was about process, not outcome, and by informing key community leaders in South Los Angeles, the COP did a good job of letting the news media make this a race issue.
1,7784,1808,7779,Why was that the case?  The quick response was good but why did it get to that point?  Were we insensitive to that fact?
1,7785,1808,7781,Who was responsible for brining it up?
1,7786,1801,7784,I don&#039;t think we are as insensitive as we have become hyper-sensitive.  The reality is that we all have our own perseptions surrounding race, and we (in this organization) are afraid to talk about it.  And it is my belief that the higher people get in the organization the more fear they have of this issue.
1,7787,1808,7785,Who was responsible for bringing it up within PSB?
2,7788,0,0,if this inicdent was to occur tomorrow what needs to be different?
1,7789,1801,7788,Better communication and role defining for those involved in the investigation and adjudication.
1,7790,1810,7788,Communications from the dept (&amp; cop) to the community that we are working the case, provide regular updates but allocate enought time to complete a thorough, unrushed inv
1,7791,1808,7788,Need to be more sensitive to who was assigned to assume inv responsibility. Due to the pressure that was put on all of the involved parties more discussion about it.<br />More inclusion of all of the players in debrieifing.<br />HYDRA would be helpful through out the process.
1,7792,1799,7788,Immediate communicaton between investigators and management to determine the direction of the investigation.
1,7793,1800,7788,This snowballed from the beginning, and it was chaotic for a while.  We should have started with one investigative leader.  All direction should have filtered through that person, instead of many directions coming from leaders.
1,7794,1809,7788,Perhaps a definitive decision, immediately, concerning who would handle the investigation.  Also, an analysis as to what we were actually looking at on the video, in an attempt to put out the fire before it gets out of control-assuming that would be possible at all.
1,7795,1808,7788,Provide better updates to the COC C/Os on what we know so they can address the issues within their own commands.
1,7796,1810,7788,With the many references to how &quot;emotional&quot; this case was, there should be a system in place (if not a culture) that allows for open discussion of this matter.
1,7797,1801,7788,Thoughtfully design the investigative team, even if those availible at the time are utilized initially, but then changed as needed to appropriately handle the mission.
1,7798,1808,7796,Assign a BSS psychologist on these high profile cases.
1,7799,1801,7788,The COP should not have made the comments about removing the flashlight publicly as he did.  He should have taken the emotion out of it by advising the rank-and-file of the reasons why prior to stating it publicly.
1,7800,1800,7798,There was one assigned - to the accused officers.  The emotional well-being of the investigators was not considered.  And I doubt any of us would even entertain the idea that we could use the help.
1,7801,1810,7800,BSS has a psych assigned to PSB. Maybe she needs to play a somewhat different role.

1,7853,1799,7841,Setting Priorities, if your home is not stable it will effect your work life.
1,7854,1811,7841,This Department has a lack of resources, which tends to make our professional lives interfer with our personal lives
1,7855,1812,7845,Set a probationary period with checklist goals to be achieved in that time.
1,7856,1813,7843,involve subordinates, 360 degree reviews throughout training
1,7857,1801,7842,not just a couple of hours about a subject that you will likely forget after you walk out of the room
1,7858,1811,7842,I&#039;m not sure what this means
1,7859,1804,7843,Genuine concern
1,7860,1810,7843,This would be important if we could have everyone within a command to be able to click into a command officer profile and be able to provide feedback annonymously.  Similar to this system.  If not for the individual then for an incident
1,7861,1809,7846,the program has to allow you to add or change method used to solve problems or manage incidents ... flexible
1,7862,1811,7843,This should be Honest Feedback
1,7863,1815,7847,Experienced and legitimate instructors are key to the success of a program such as this.  We must stop looking to the obvious people (e.g. Training Division) and use various subject matter experts.  Additionally, we must use people who understand adult learning and know how to teach to the masses (e.g. auditory, visual, hands-on, etc.)
1,7864,1801,7842,focus on the issues that really matter or are likely to get you in trouble in your position and spend the most time trng in that category.

1,7867,1804,7847,Real life experience / field experinece
1,7868,1811,7843,We often don&#039;t like to hear what others think of us, but the 360s are a good tool
1,7869,1812,7848,There should be a reference available with examples of prior situations and how they were handled by other people.
1,7870,1811,7844,I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about.
1,7871,1813,7847,must draw upon the experience of others and provide honest, detailed analyses of actual experiences.  taught by practitioners and leaders, not figure heads with little or no experience in the field.
1,7872,1801,7843,practice scenarios are helpful as long as the simulation is real and there is an opportunity to debrief afterwards.
1,7873,1805,7845,some need this more than others and there should be an exit cluse for those that are competent and not in need of some of the basic trng needed by others
1,7874,1804,7845,Include people skills
1,7875,1811,7844,Sounds more like an oral answer that does not mean anything but sounds good
1,7876,1809,7845,the students needs to learn by hands on versus read.  have a practical application
1,7877,1807,7845,There are training programs for the upper ranks but the attendance has not been timely and most would say they do not directly relate to the job.  The counter argument to that is that those selected for promotion have demonstrated skill for the job and they need the experience of working in the position.  This works in some cases and not in others.
1,7878,1806,7842,There has to be meaning in what we learn and teach.  A good approach is  developing tested teaching techniques for teh adult learner.
1,7879,1799,7842,Based on latest information<br />Can be applied to current job<br />Increases personal knowledge
1,7880,1813,7845,need a roadmap of where to go and how to get there.  we can&#039;t experience everything but can learn from others.. mentoring program with value?
1,7881,1808,7841,Be proactive in both professional and personal mentorship to try to ensure the proper balance of professional vs. personal demands.  This should ideally include, opportunities for marriage and family counseling, financial counseling, if necessary and possible, spritial counseling.
1,7882,1811,7845,Absolutely, good idea.  Must sign off on various scenarios (pursuit management; crime scene management; coordination of resources at high profile scene; personnel issues including complaint adjudication; serving employee; etc)
1,7883,1810,7845,This would be helpful if we had a mentoring process where a command officer could meet with you to discuss you leadership challenges and shortcomings.<br />Allow for feedback from the CO and make it confidential
1,7884,1801,7845,Training for the upper ranks should reflect the ramifications of decisions and the manner in which they are received and perceived by the troops and those that feel those decisions the most.
1,7885,1815,7848,Not only must we look at real world issue, we must also be willing to look outside of our own organization.  This is a time in which joint operations, coordination, sharing of resources, and information sharing is critical, so we should start building the relationships while we train.  This means including others from outside of the organization.
1,7886,1809,7842,credible instructors who have made mistakes and had successes who can share those, training that allows me to try to do under observation.
1,7887,1806,7843,This suggestion required an open line of communication and the ability to stomach the truth.  There is constant critizism of management in the organization, but little room for constructive critizism of superiors.  There is much work to be done here.
1,7888,1813,7844,what relevance?  if it values to you, it matters to the orginization and vice versa.  someone needs a hug
1,7889,1811,7846,For outside training, need funds to pay for it.  This Dept is terrible about funding training
1,7890,1810,7847,this is critical.  There is a need to rotate members of the lieutenant rank or captains within commands to provide greater experience levels
1,7891,1805,7843,this needs to be done anonymously due to our culture not encouraging honest critiscm of others.  this might be just as well served by starting an honest feedback training in the early stages of an officrs career.
1,7892,1811,7846,The training is out there, but hard to get to (who is paying for it; time to get it)
1,7893,1811,7846,Should get outside cadre of trainers to facilitate leadership/management training
1,7894,1812,7845,Need staff to make sure that the development program is consistant across all areas of Department.
1,7895,1801,7848,remind the command staff that having power doesn&#039;t mean that it is necessary to come in and change everything or assert yourself in the daily operations of an entity just to show you&#039;re in charge.  Be open minded about what works and where the change should be and devote time and efforts to issues that need addressing.
1,7896,1807,7842,This is a historical problem within the Department and many believe the current CEDP mandated type training is less than valuable. Much of this is mandated and therefore a moot point.  To make training meaningful for a large organization it should be de-centralized, but coordinated, to ensure it is accurate and germane.
1,7897,1815,7846,Stop looking at leadership training as one size fits all, and once delivered there is no need for follow-up.  Leadership takes continual effort, thus we must constantly reinforce our leadership prowess, by continually striving for excellence through follow-up/advanced training.
1,7898,1810,7844,I agree that it will need to be worth our time
1,7899,1809,7846,show the student successes and failures in different operations so we can see what worked and what did not
1,7900,1806,7844,The question from the subordinate here is what is in it for me?  We are dealing with a different generation in this day and age.  It must be evident to the subordinate.
1,7901,1813,7841,personal life affects work life so we should focus on our lives and our employees lives away from work...which is about 3/4 of your time.. good approach to deal with home lives..
1,7902,1805,7847,the instructors must have the respect of the students in order to be completely effective.  This will come from their real life experience and how they have handled those experiences.
1,7903,1811,7847,Of course it would be experienced based; how else would we know about it other than science fiction?
1,7904,1799,7845,Setting up training programs that teach the necessary material required for promotion, as opposed to LAPD&#039;s pre-test list which does not reflect the actual promotional test questions.
1,7905,1815,7841,If we teach balance, then this idea must be supported from the top down.  If we teach it, but those at the highest levels don&#039;t believe it, then mixed messages will be sent and the training will be pointless.
1,7906,1809,7846,have supervisors of the same rank in the audience during a debrief or after action so the issues and decisions can be shared first hand.
1,7907,1801,7842,use instructors that aren&#039;t dinasours within the organization,  Bring in new instructors from around country/state and that can inject dept with fresh ideas and innovative concepts.
1,7908,1811,7847,Someone should record (or have a central location in which we could send them) all the various scenarios we deal with; to develop different scenarios to pontificate
1,7909,1804,7847,Many can learn from ones success as well as failures.
1,7910,1806,7845,Provide a proven method to follow the progress of each individual.  Constant feedback and self analysis is key in this area.
1,7911,1807,7841,Leadership is about knowing your people and having empathy for their needs.  While empathy is generally a value one is raised with and not something inculcated later in life, if someone is lacking this quality they need to be reminded of its importance.  Some people have an epiphany later in life and do learn the value of caring for others.
1,7912,1813,7848,we should have a team who not only researches but seeks out issues nationally and developes a real world view for this department.  we can and should learn from others..
1,7913,1810,7848,The gloves need to be taken off during training where command and student are not concerned about saying certain things that may hurt your career in the future.  This system would have a great application in many areas of our department.  There is a fear to say the king is not wearing any clothes, or that the teacher is not wearing any shoes
1,7914,1808,7845,There needs to be clear guidelines and expectations as to what is required learning during the promotional probationary periods.  For example there are those that have passed detective probation that have never been to trial or written a search warrant.  Another example is a sergeant that gets off of probation and has never completed a use of force, pursuit or complaint investigation.  As it stands now there are no standardized requirments for promotional probationary periods it is totally subjective and up to the will and professionalism of the person doing the training and writing the performance evaluation.  This system is ripe for mediocre performance and incopetence in the ranks.
1,7915,1805,7848,most of our current trng is mandate driven and generally very basic.  It would be a blessing to see some real life hands on type training by some real experts.
1,7916,1811,7848,More toward &quot;best practices&quot; throughout the State and nation, rather than Department specific
2,7917,0,0,Who are the key sponsors of this philosophy and how can we get their buy-in
1,7918,1806,7897,A set of training criterion should be established and agreed upon, with specific training in leadership.
1,7919,1810,7842,	his is too vague.  Meaningful to you is not always meaningful to the group.  difficult concept
1,7920,1809,7890,i agree there should be a mandatory transfer after the first year of experience to allow the lieutenant to experience a different environment
1,7921,1813,7917,top down.  everyone has a stake in the success of all levels of the orginization.  if cop believes in it, it will transcend down the orginization.
1,7922,1806,7847,Select instructors who have both classroom and field experience in leadership and management.
1,7923,1801,7846,advise mgmt in the dept of what new issues and techniques are being taught to recruits so we have some idea why they are doing things the way they are.  We&#039;ve been on for awhile and are unfamiliar with what trng division is teaching.
1,7924,1805,7917,it will need to be driven from the outside inorder to get it moving
1,7925,1811,7905,Future captains (ie us lieutenants now) are expected to give of themselves unrealistically, for no incentive other than to be a captain (ie-no monetary incentive; no time off).  A patrol captain is expected to kiss their families good bye and hope to see them later
1,7926,1806,7848,Utilize true life experiences and provide a comprehensive analysis.  A play by play as a learning tool.
1,7927,1799,7847,The department should devolp methods for gathering information from experienced personnel other than the standard see who is willing to do training. Current knowledge is only extracted from those willing to take on a teaching role. Quite often the most experienced personal retire and their knowledge is never passed on.
1,7928,1804,7917,Seek input from our subordinates.  Make them part of the decision making process.
1,7929,1810,7846,In addition to the development, there needs to be a system in place where if we have mentored and trained and the employee doesnt get it, there are consequences.
1,7930,1809,7917,begin to make the supervisor of the supervisor accountable you will see how quick the attitude changes
1,7931,1815,7891,For those that are real leaders, this would never be an issue.  However, it seems that we have a tendency to promote those who are unprepared and insecure, so they can not deal with honest critizism.  They would rather hear a bunch of &quot;yes men&quot; because it helps their ego.
1,7932,1801,7845,Allow your people to do their jobs.  Some have vast experience and ideas worth exploring.  A stifling environment hinders creativity and keeps the organization from moving forward.
1,7933,1807,7848,Dealing with real world issues means having the courage to face up to difficult allegations from outside and inside the Department.  Too many times the seriousness of the allegation overshadows the courage to evaluate the evidence.  For example, when a serious allegation is made there is huge pressure to take some action against an officer, and later we discover what the astute investigator knew in the first days of the investigation.  Politics and political perception skews reality and those accused suffer.
1,7934,1797,7846,The Department does not do well by having additional personnel to fill in and/or cover while employees are away at training.
1,7935,1806,7917,The Lieutenant rank is the important transition between the cops and management.  There has to be a by-in by Lts.
1,7936,1809,7844,this should not matter if your focused on the job at hand
1,7937,1811,7917,Starts with the COP, but really involves all the upper staff officers who feed important information and suggestions to the COP (ie Cmdrs, Dep Chiefs, Asst Chiefs)
1,7938,1805,7844,if you personally embrace the idea and share the experience then it will be of value to the organization.  The will be to get individual buy in first.
1,7939,1808,7842,Training that is current and relevant to issues facing our department and law enforcement in general.  This Department tends not to look to outside resources for training and as a result we are not taking full advantage of learning from the experiences of other departments.   We should implement more training opportunities outside our organization to broaden our perspective.
1,7940,1815,7844,This is critical if you believe that leadership is more than a position or title.  If you do, then leadership (ethical decision making, understanding people, carring about others, managing resources, humility, etc.) is something that adds value to all that we do.
1,7941,1804,7844,Outstanding work by an officer needs to be recognized.  This can be done in both verbal and written form.
1,7942,1807,7917,Who are the key sponsors of what philosophy?
1,7943,1813,7847,get rid of lt II positions, make patrol more prestegious and rotate lieutenants throughout the department to assignments.  everyone rotates...prior to any specialized assignment, you have to go back to patrol for a time then work out again.  de-specialize this place and our experience base will increase exponentially.  that way all will benefit.. oh yeah one rule.. if you work on the 6th floor you can&#039;t make captain!!!
1,7944,1816,7935,how do we get this buy-in
1,7945,1808,7887,You want the truth......We can&#039;t handle the truth!!!
1,7946,1810,7917,yu have to force it down thier throats.  Those in a position to change things.... Not all but some, do not change well.  LAPD got into the position they were in because we continued to believe we were the best and did not want to do anything new.  COMPSTAT forced on us, COMPLAINT SYSTEM forced on us, Unfortunately it would require the buy in from Bratton and a couple of Asst CHiefs.
1,7947,1805,7844,I personally believe, that would be me Matt Blake that the only important thing is what is important to me...
1,7948,1797,7843,many persons are afraid to make a decision because of the negative comments and/or discipline associated with the risks taken
1,7949,1815,7874,We need to punish people who are placed in positions and then fail to act as leaders.  Instead, we ignore them or just move them around.  If we are going to call ourselves an organization of leaders, then we need to foster an atmosphere that rewards leadership and punishes those who choice not to be leaders, or are incapable.
2,7950,0,0,is there an appetite for creativity and flair in decision making and leadership development programmes (a little more than yes or no please)
1,7951,1801,7847,Expose the lower ranks of the dept to some of the more noteworthy scenarios and allow them to see how and what decisions were made and give them an opportunity to see what could have been done better.  They will be future supervisors and allow them to think about these topics or issues while they are in the field and it may help them make better decisions.
1,7952,1811,7847,Less theoretical; more hands-on, proven successful suggestions from experiences
1,7953,1815,7883,I agree, but it cannot be another mentoring in a box program.  We have to change our culture into one that truly values mentoring at all levels.  That means just doing it because it is right, all the time.  As opposed to calendaring a meeting with your mentor and chatting for a few minutes.
1,7954,1810,7841,I really need help in the personal part of my life.  I need help now.  I am affraid to say who I am because I run a prestigeous undercover unit within internal affairs
1,7955,1809,7906,Have central location a major incident can be debriefed with and audience that can watch only and learn....this will create What If&#039;s unique to your area of command and offer solutions versus guesses.
1,7956,1805,7950,no, most people understand the consequences for failure and rarely step outside the box.
1,7957,1813,7950,for some yes.. a lot are afraid of change and will hesitate at moments notice of anything new and innovative.  however, for the rest of us there is a huge appetite for creativity and decision making programs (you brits really can&#039;t spell, can you?)  	he department should encourage and support innovation and creativity in decision making.
1,7958,1801,7841,recognize that officers have personal demands that play on their performance at work.  Show empathy for them when they need it and they&#039;ll reciprocate with increased productivity and a willingness to work harder for the supervisor.
1,7959,1807,7917,The police deparment is driven by what the community wants.  This is inevitable but we have to be responsive.  The difficult road is recognizing what the community, including the silent majority, really wants and addressing it.  The vocal minority drives the Department in bad directions and in opposition to the silent majority that deserves proper service.  Leaders must seek out these voices and help them become part of the vocal contributors.
1,7960,1808,7937,Many times information is so sanitized and filtered by the time it gets to the commander/deputy chief level they rarely hear the real deal.  Vertical staff meetings on a regular basis could eliminate a lot of the filtering.
1,7961,1811,7950,In today&#039;s upper management, I say yes.  Bratton brings an outside perspective to the LAPD, which seems to allow for creative, non-traditional ideas/concepts to be voice and decided upon
1,7962,1811,7950,Now more than ever before in this organization
1,7963,1809,7950,i think there is an appetite for creativity but to many chefs ruin the puddin
1,7964,1813,7950,this department really does not innovate any more.  we were once thought of as a leader and innovator but we have become exceedingly stagnet and arrogant in our ways.  we need new and refreshing thoughts and ideas and the freedom to develop as well as the courage to experiment and make mistakes.
1,7965,1807,7843,Those persons that are afraid to make decisions should not be decision makers.  We must hold our subordinates accountable if they don&#039;t have the guts to stand up and take a side on an issue.
1,7966,1815,7914,Yes, but this is the proven way to get promoted in the LAPD.  Get out of the field as fast as you can (because that is safer).  Make no decisions, because then you will have made no bad ones.  Ignore potential problems, because you will surely find a new position before it blows up, and make sure you get face time, so that you are picked by the ACs during the next round of promotions.
1,7967,1801,7848,trng shouldn&#039;t last for just a couple of hours and then be forgotten.  There needs to be some type of opportunity to keep it fresh in the supervisor&#039;s mind so he can draw upon it when needed.
1,7968,1806,7858,There is a good book out ~The meaning of life~ which has to do with the concentration camps.  It is an excellent book in this area.
1,7969,1804,7841,This is not only important for leaders in our organization but also for the officers who work for us.  It is important for us, as leaders, to know our people and how their personal life could be affecting their professional life.
1,7970,1799,7848,The department needs to open itself up to new ideas faster. Many outside departments react faster to changing situations because they don&#039;t have as many rules , a thick manual, orders that not in the manual, etc. Change is blocked by these rules, especially when the COP is the only one that can give approval for a variance. The COP should allow more rules to be changed by lower levels of management. With an organization this big the road to change is too long when every major change needs COP approval.
1,7971,1813,7956,be a leader then
1,7972,1811,7964,Disagree.  I see more creativity today than in any years past.  In past, the breakthroughs were significant; today, with litigation/risk management/resource demands, it is better to find out what works than invent your own and try it out
1,7973,1801,7845,teach them its okay to make a decision and not fear reprisal from the top.  Many command staff decisions seem to be made or not made because they fear they will be disgraced, demoted or given freeway therapy if they make a decision the chief or someone at the top didn&#039;t like.
1,7974,1813,7947,You are totally spot on dude!  I love you man!!
1,7975,1813,7972,examples?
1,7976,1806,7950,There is a tremendous shift in thinking in the organization.  The new Chief and the upper management for the most part have become key in creating a forward thinking management team.  We are not there yet, but we closer than before.
1,7977,1815,7943,Get rid of the Jacobs paygrade system.  It locks people into positions and keeps them there.  We need to be able to move those who are, and who are not performing well.
1,7978,1807,7966,Sad, but unfortunetely, too often true.
1,7979,1812,7905,For some leaders, their professional life is also their personal life.
1,7980,1805,7965,unfortunately, we have made a history of promoting less than strong leaders.  it is much easier to talk about it than to really do it.
1,7981,1808,7846,We can do a much better job at recognizing and learning from best practices.  There are all kind of department publications out there, but none really focus on what is working and how.  We could really get some mileage out of an official Department best practices publication.  Especially in terms of problem solving to eradicate long term problems.  This should be a part of a continuing developement program.
1,7982,1810,7950,THere is a need for results.  There are some who encourage it in this organization and then there are some who stifle it.  It needs to be rewarded and sought out agressively at all levels of the organization.  We have a saying in this organization .... We do it this way because we always have..... THat should never be repeated
1,7983,1811,7919,Agree.  have you ever tried to create a training program and expect everyone to find value and meaning in every aspect of the training?  Each person has his/her own wants/needs/expectations
1,7984,1801,7950,Not in most of the dept.  Here, there is too much fear of adminstrative disapproval that will have long term ramifications if the chief or his staff doesn&#039;t like them.
1,7985,1809,7954,bill call me later
1,7986,1809,7985,scratch that who ever you are call me later
1,7987,1811,7878,That seems to be the genre of the day.  Tomorrow, it may be something else
1,7988,1797,7841,We have pleanty of resources to assit people in their personal life, hence to make things better.  However, are we really using these resources to help people or is it window dressing?
1,7989,1801,7950,We are isolationists here.  We think we are better than everyone else and that no one in a smaller agency could possibly have anything to offer us that would be helpful.  We are a tough audience.
1,7990,1799,7950,No, true creativity within the department has been hampered. It has been nice to see new managment be placed at the top of LAPD, but the new management came to LAPD with the idea that it is broken and all great ideas will come from the outside. LAPD personnel have and will do great things.  The new management needs to put more trust in their LAPD staff.
1,7991,1815,7847,Many of our sergeants, lieutenants, and captains are very competent leaders, but you would never know it because our culture does not allow for them to show it.  We are an incredibly micro managing organization, I think, because those in high places don&#039;t seem to understand that great leadership is when your subordinates accomplish great things.  Instead, most of them seem to think that great leadership is them directing our every move.

1,8094,1815,8041,Develop an approach with the overall goals of the Department in mind.  Make sure the program is workable within the Department&#039;s goals and objectives and that there is an adequate level of buy-in throughout the ranks.

1,8117,1806,8032,A good place for the Best Practice Policy to come into play.  Many other agencies/countries are light years ahead of us in these areas.
1,8118,1817,8038,As with anything we really care about; hire the best for the job.  Any other process lessens the chance for a sucessful venture.
1,8119,1803,8034,I believe in admin promotion, not be taking a test ....There is many leaders that are outstanding that should be exempt from taking a test to promote...We need to focus placing the best folks in the positon of leadership, not by a written test
1,8120,1809,8040,Maintaining a data base and sharing past successes throughout the Department.
1,8121,1797,8036,develop an understanding what is essential equipment for a particular detective group
1,8122,1810,8099,once again we need to look to outside training to enhance are detectives.  we have the same tired old schools. LT Papke is a great guy, but is there some else who can teach interogation skills?
1,8123,1809,8099,Making available college level law classes.
1,8124,1804,8038,Experience, experience, experience, but allow other to learn before the experience is lost.
1,8125,1811,8122,So true.
1,8126,1819,8102,We are progressing in this area with &#039;Vertical Staff Meetings.&#039;  But the changes that come out of those meetings just happen without any explanation provided to the entities impacted.  We have a Department webpage that tells you what is happening, but very rarely tells you why it is happening.
1,8127,1803,8068,When we come on the job, we are assing a training officer... We need program set up for New Dets that they are married up with a Training Officer Det to teach them
1,8128,1806,8036,Step out of the LAPD box and review other agencies/countries systems.  Merge LAPD systems with other proven systems of others to meet the mission requirements.
1,8129,1817,8036,GPS devices on all black and white patrol vehicles.  Communications would send a call to the closest available vehicle.
1,8130,1797,8103,personal observations of employees inadequately attempting to perform their task
1,8131,1811,8038,Pick the best and most qualified person for the job.
1,8132,1809,8041,Knowing beforehand the desired outcome and setting strategic goals to accomplish the desired end.
1,8133,1808,8040,Develope a think tank that includes not only law enforcement entities from all over the world but others such as doctors, lawyers, business people, etc. who meet on a regular basis.  Then use their ideas in the instructional phase of this program.
2,8134,0,0,Messages to senior management
1,8135,1819,8119,There still should be some sort of qualifier.  Quality work as a detective trainee or filing cases as a vice cop.  We still have too much of a &#039;good old boy&#039; network to trust that the right people will be selected.
1,8136,1803,8033,We have City Attorneys that provide conflicting legal opinions.. how are we going to get our leaders to be consistent ...?
1,8137,1810,8032,We have gotten into a case of &#039;mass training&#039; due our size.  we need to personalize it some how.
1,8138,1819,8129,Sure would make code x more difficult!
1,8139,1804,8039,Communicate with everyone, not just the people at the top or the bottom, but be honest.
1,8140,1817,8036,Digital recorders to chrono your activities while at a scene and able to download to a computer using voice recognition technology.
1,8141,1811,8039,We rely on the command staff to make the right decision when they have not been properly trained to do so.
1,8142,1797,8131,get real.  LAPD is a political machine and will promote and appoint employees to coveted positons base on race and sex.
1,8143,1803,8034,All employees of the Dept should have Bachelors Degree... make it manditory...
1,8144,1806,8035,Seriously look into the accessment center type training systems that many other agencies use.
1,8145,1810,8134,they need a suggustion box
1,8146,1809,8037,Soliciting and encouraging Jr. employees to be involved in the decision making process.
1,8147,1815,8122,I am his back-up instructor and have taught the Interrogation course and the practical for a few years in Detective School and ICI when he had other commitments.  I only stopped because I was ordered to decrease training time by my CO.  That may change soon.  He is a great guy never to be replaced but there are others out there.
1,8148,1804,8040,Ensure all employees have access to the best practices.
1,8149,1820,8145,sounds a bit lame to me- there must be something more radical than that
1,8150,1810,8134,Magagement needs feedback from the rank and file.  without getting their feelings hurt.  ant their boses need to have access to them.
1,8151,1817,8134,RETIRE -- YOU&#039;VE DONE ENOUGH
1,8152,1811,8134,Get training for the police comm and IG&#039;s office in the area of tactics, commom sence and good judgment.
1,8153,1811,8126,Dont buy it
1,8154,1817,8134,If senior management wants to hear the truth, sit down with the grunts and only the grunts.  Supervisors... out of the room.
1,8155,1818,8036,need to remember the simple human needs of sleeping and eating.  Sometimes forgotten during a high profile investigations.
1,8156,1810,8149,it worked for Subway Sandwiches..
1,8157,1809,8134,Trust the decisions of your supervisors because we also have the good of the Department at heart.
1,8158,1804,8041,Always have a plan B from the best practices list when things turn sideways.
1,8159,1806,8034,The dual status of Det/Sgt should be continued so as to inject a sound management/supervisory background into the detective ranks.  This is not popular among some detectives, but a sound global approach for a better end product.
1,8160,1811,8149,I agree.  Suggestion box, pick up the phone
1,8161,1809,8145,The must address the suggestions in some manner..
1,8162,1817,8155,Amen to that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,8163,1819,8142,I wish that weren&#039;t true.  But as long as we have Women&#039;s Leadership Conferences and OJB parties celebrating race-specific promotions, this will remain a fact.  There are qualified &#039;under-represented class&#039; people who get promoted, but their promotions will be suspect because of these divisive groups.  It becomes unfair all around.
1,8164,1815,8037,Develop an atmosphere where we do not torture people for actually having an original thought that may work in a given situation.
1,8165,1804,8099,On line monthly updates on case law that relate to your investigative assignment.
1,8166,1809,8114,Great idea!
1,8167,1806,8134,Rethink DROP, nature isn&#039;t all wrong.  People retire for a reason.  You gave some of them the wrong reason to stay.
1,8168,1797,8134,I find that i&#039;m asking myself, why am i here participating in this excercise?   This is so futile.  90% of LAPD management really only focuses on thier own personal goals and egos.  You will review these comments, disregard them and move on.  I base this on over thirty years experience with the department.
1,8169,1810,8143,whos going to take your job so you can retire.  most of your good leaders have GED&#039;s ,  but they dont spel to wel.
1,8170,1800,8134,Leadership isn&#039;t about the latest &quot;talking head&quot; saying all the right things and giving a great class.<br />Please model true leadership.  Make decisions based on all available facts.  Identify your biases, admit them, and make every effort to keep them out of your decision making process.  Hold yourselves accountable and then hold everyone else accountable.  The only thing worse than not holding people accountable is not being accountable yourself.
1,8171,1819,8134,I have no objection to making this entire discussion available to them.  Make it mandatory reading.  They should be aware of what is really in the heads of their people.
1,8172,1809,8119,I think the written test should remain.
1,8173,1815,8140,There are people at divisional level already using voice recognition technology.  Never wait around for the Department to provide your tools.  You will carry a very light toolbox!!!!!
1,8174,1811,8143,Why.......If you only knew how many homicides are cleared by non degree holding officers.
1,8175,1820,8168,Response from Jonathan, I faced this at Scotland Yard and we developed a new way of thinking, I thank you for your commitments and I am determined to make this happen!
1,8176,1818,8134,Don,t take things personal, if you ask the question don,t get upset when you don&#039;t get the response you were looking for.. which will result in promotion assassination
1,8177,1804,8134,Every case is not a homicide, so don&#039;t treat unfounded cases like they are.
1,8178,1809,8143,Negative!  In my opinion everyone should strive to obtain a BA; however, to make it mandatory we may lose those with a degree in common sense.
1,8179,1815,8155,If the Department wanted you to sleep and eat during high profile investigations you would get blue food and a blue bed with  numbers on them......
1,8180,1806,8038,It&#039;s the supervisors job to develop their personnel, not accept the norm and comfort levels.  Be able to make that unpopular decision that&#039;s right for the section or unit.  If you want a friend, but a dog.
1,8181,1817,8143,I&#039;ve put many killers in jail with my AA degree.
1,8182,1804,8037,If the job gets done and there is no violation of Department policy or the law, allow the employees creativity.
1,8183,1809,8069,Yes it does include the incident involving other agencies.
1,8184,1811,8181,Good for you..........Your point
1,8185,1808,8134,Lets take politics out of the decision making for once and try to get to the real truth.  Politics always seems to cloud their decision making.
1,8186,1800,8134,Do we even know who we mean when we say messages to senior management?  Do we mean the COP?  Do we think it&#039;s just the one individual that we&#039;re thinking of?  I don&#039;t know that this exercise has been that clear
1,8187,1809,8183,The Burbank incident was a great one that we had at a training day......
1,8188,1811,8181,Ive trained officers with Masters and they were as dumb as dirt
1,8189,1808,8143,What can be learned from a BSS
1,8190,1804,8035,The training should be interesting to make people want to attend training.  Not all powerpoints.
2,8191,0,0,The leader that has the certain tingle factor is
2,8192,0,0,What would it look like
1,8193,1815,8192,It would include a multitude of different demands being put on the leader to have to manage.<br />There needs to be some tactical piece, a criminal inv piece, a resouce issue, political pressure, media interest, community concerns, the race card.<br />Specialized detectives would have to be involved.  While all of these things are occuring there the other issues of day-to-day life needs to continue.
1,8194,1815,8192,Does it need to be a specific set of facts or concepts only?
1,8195,1826,8192,Command officer is faced with three problems at the beginning of his/her day. One involves a serious personnel issue such as an officer despondent  and suicidal over a pending divorce, a barricaded suspect with a hostage out in the field, and a dead body located in a remote area of the division.  The commanding officer has to prioritize and delegate and make a number of decisions at the same time. The scenario would unfold with each scenario changing and/or progressing with each decision.
1,8196,1806,8192,The two primary issues that police officers deal with are crime and officer conduct.  Charges of racism, brutality, and overzealous police work are constant in many of our working environments.  I believe that our leadership exercise should contain an incident where these issues are present because they affect the brand new patrol officer to the Chief of Police.  A politically charged use of force incident would begin this exercise and it would develop from there.
1,8197,1818,8192,Scenario involves problems surrounding an urban high school that has been experieincing student unrest on campus, high crime around the campus, limited resources, and burdensome bureaucratic rules.
1,8198,1824,8192,The senario could involve a tactical or field situation that encompasses different perceptions and experiences of the involved personnel, which poses the potential to create conflicts regarding solutions for the situation.  The senario may also involve the different levels of command as the address the matter, ie police officers, watch commanders and command and staff officers, and, perceptual and experience differences between various divisional and Department entities as they respond to the scene or situation.
1,8199,1815,8195,The Watch commander still has to run the watch and would be at scene at the barricaded susp.<br />There would be an issue with who knows about the suicidal officer..is BSS involved?<br />The homicide detectives will be out in the field.
1,8200,1828,8192,A shooting scenario at a High School with numerous victims down.  The suspect has barricaded himself in a classroom with several students.  There is a group of students who are insisting on acting as vigilantes, which would create a tremendous amount of danger for them.  The school faculty is of no assistance and refuses to assist.  This started out as a racial problem between the Black and Hispanic students.
1,8201,1826,8195,1) The command officer will need to delegate tasks to appropriate individuals such as the Lt watch commander, Lt Det OIC, and any other supervisors.<br />2)Direction will have to be given to each entity and the assurance of updates needs to be stressed.<br />3) The key is to put the right person in the right job.
2,8202,0,0,tell it to me straight

1,8209,1806,8202,the most creative thing i have done in lapd is pass my background investigation.
1,8210,1821,8202,used informants to clear officers in internal affairs investigations.
1,8211,1827,8202,immediately
1,8212,1815,8202,To make a police officer of someone from Oklahoma
1,8213,1824,8202,used many city and department resources to impact crime in a small neighborhood
1,8214,1828,8202,found a way to spy  JJ and saw him wearing a dress
1,8215,1816,8202,take my shoes off when I am being creative
1,8216,1825,8202,The most creative thing I have done in LAPD has been dealing with some  creative supervisors
1,8217,1818,8202,keep my sergeant thinking heruns the unit.

1,8228,1821,8212,you must be using the term&quot;police officer&quot; very liberally
1,8229,1810,8214,was it that strapless evening gown he wore to the xmas party
1,8230,1800,8212,dont forget those irish guys

1,8247,1823,8237,get rid of the table top exercises that is currently the trend in  the department.  Hands on, practical exercises are the way most people will truly understand the training
1,8248,1824,8235,having a common level of operational proficiency so that you can count on a degree of expertise and professional operations from your peers in an effort to accomplish a common task
1,8249,1826,8237,we get no training and the training we do get is not real training that can be applied to the street
1,8250,1828,8235,opprtunity to document and share ideas to improve the quality of the operartion.
1,8251,1800,8238,debriefing is very important because we learn from our mistakes and improve for the future.
1,8252,1824,8237,very few people actually have problems with sexual harassment and descrimination, so why not addess that training on an individual level rather than wasting our time department wide
1,8253,1806,8241,Be honest instead of politically correct.  Officers lose faith in command staff when lied to.
1,8254,1824,8237,make training practical to the tasks you need to accomplish
1,8255,1826,8241,there is none gang unit comes to roll call and never has any info to pass.
1,8256,1817,8244,using officers that are competent and proven
1,8257,1800,8241,communication is key to any thing which needs to be done .
1,8258,1815,8242,During the briefing ensure that all personnel assigned to the operations have a clear understanding of the mission, the reason of the mission, the goals of the mission, their assignment and the importance of officer safety.
1,8259,1821,8243,organization must be willing to back officers actions when split second decisions are made, even if a 6 month analysis of the situation later shows that another option may have been better. until this happens, people will be afraid to make decisions or try new things.
1,8260,1824,8241,dont be selfish, when we&#039;re all working on the same problem, share your information, at least your peers will know who contributed
1,8261,1806,8244,make the right decision even if it is unpopular.
1,8262,1822,8244,starts from the top. If you work for a good leader who you trust, you buy into the mission. you have less fear and tend not to worry about consiquence.
1,8263,1825,8244,You have to trust and believe in the supervisor making the decision and have full confidence in his or her ability, as well as each member in the team.
1,8264,1828,8236,keep upper command staff out of the way, their job is to support not to take over, they are out of the every day loop in the streets, so why should they insert themselves into the situation at it&#039;s highest intensity point such as a street shooting. Let the street level ofcrs, sgt run it and get them what they need.
1,8265,1821,8243,make decisions based on good police work, not possible litigation.
1,8266,1818,8244,Ofcrs must have the ability to make decisions and be trusted that the the decisions that they make are appropriate. Ofcrs and supervisors in the field should not be required to seek approval from command staff to make decisions, especially when a delay in making the decision causes a loss in valuable time. Within the LAPD the ofcrs and supervisors usually have more experience with critical decision making in the field thanthe persons who get pissed off that you made a decision.
1,8267,1817,8243,letting leaders make decisions not just  supervisors
1,8268,1824,8243,the officers with the ugliest looking personnel packages probably have the highest ability to supervise. You shouldn&#039;t promote just because you haven&#039;t made a decision that would get you into trouble.
1,8269,1828,8240,our documentation methods are out of date by 30 years.
1,8270,1823,8235,award those who have experience and competence.  these leaders are the people that are going to be leading the department in the future hence effect the overall work product, community satisfaction and crime statistics of the future
1,8271,1826,8244,this department doesn&#039;t put trust in its officers. officers are not allowed to make mistakes cause mistakes are held against you and they stay in your package
1,8272,1800,8239,appropriate equipment is needed to accomplish the task at hand.  a key to completing the mission without delay.
1,8273,1817,8239,equipment used should be known to everyone not a select few
1,8274,1815,8241,Ensure that the mission is properly and clearly communicated to the assigned personnel.  Ensure that there is proper and sufficient communications between everyone assigned to the operation.  Clear &amp; concise communications is imperative for officer safety abd the success of the mission.
1,8275,1824,8239,when our division has night vision equiptment and we work at night, why should we have to fill out a request form to be able to use it, let alone every time we use it?
1,8276,1818,8239,dont&#039;t tell me to go out and cure the worlds ills and not give me the means or equipment to at least give it a good try. we shouldn&#039;t have to beg for cars and equipment while paper pushers drive around new cars.
1,8277,1825,8238,We become successful not only by remembering what we did to achieve our success, but also by learning from our mistakes and failures so we do not make the same ones in the future.
1,8278,1827,8237,A lot of the skills we use in the field atrophy without practice. Most OIS&#039;s result in no hits due to the lack of firearms training. We qualify once every other month. Shooting training days are no longer permitted (with some exceptions) due to the consent decree. Tactics, likewise, suffer because the only discussion is during occasional debriefs and rare roll-call training. The lack of training is supplemented by personal firearms training and tactical discussions between partners but of-course precludes team responses. All of us know sexual harrasment policy. How many know how to use a hook and ram?
1,8279,1822,8242,combat and fight crime, not the officers who attempt to carry out.
1,8280,1806,8246,the chanllenge is sharing information that other units would find relevant because of the volume of intelligence everyday.
1,8281,1815,8244,You must have sufficient trust in your supervisor and fellow officers to have a successful and safe mission.
1,8282,1824,8244,the department needs to stress quality hiring. officers in specialized units can&#039;t always trust that other officers, or civilian employees, can keep sensitive information confidential
1,8283,1817,8246,get as much information as possible and give all the info to the officers. cover every possible angle
1,8284,1826,8243,officers don&#039;t make decisions out of fear of being second guessed by managment
1,8285,1828,8236,mediocrity is cultivated and rewarded with out shame.
1,8286,1824,8246,units like our GIT should have weekly meetings from all entities involved to share info. there is a lot of doubling of work, and not enough communication to be effective.
1,8287,1821,8243,important to have leaders with experience and success in the past in the particular area they are leading in. example - gang supervisor or lieutenant that was never a good gang officer.
1,8288,1800,8243,being able to make the decision and be responsible for your decision.  prior to making a decision, be open to other ways of doing things and not be narrow minded.
1,8289,1823,8246,as the watch sergeant approving reports feels that this report contains nformation that should be passed on to the following watches, he/she can asterick the report.  when records inputs the report it will be put into t database so it can be shown on the overhead at furtue roll calls
1,8290,1818,8237,its bad enough that all you haveto do now to join the lapd is get on a treadmill and not have a heart attack, now ofcrs in the field can&#039;t get training. the trianing we do get tells us houw to stand and liten to someoneelse tell us what screwups we are and that they are gonna have my badge.
1,8291,1827,8239,The department demands photos of crime scenes but provides few cameras. The police vehicles have all kinds of problems. But God-damn there&#039;s plenty of PODs to go around.
1,8292,1822,8237,hands on training. not through some B.S. E-LEARNING on a computer that some geek downtown thought of.
1,8293,1815,8240,Documentation is an integral part of every operation....Dept. Policy and other Dept. requirements, court purposes and possible law suits.
1,8294,1806,8236,promote officers who have sacrificied thier career for the better of the community and department instead of those who have never taken a risk dont have the experience/ leadership to understand the assignment.
1,8295,1810,8240,A certain amount of documentation is required to record results, share intellgence, and evaluate the effectiveness of an operation.  However, the documentation should be concise and restricted to what is necessary.  Currently, we are required to duplicate the documentation of our activities, fill out useless logs, and conduct audits to ensure that we have filled out all of our meaningless paperwork.
1,8296,1826,8239,give officers equipment that work. we drive around in cars that shouldn&#039;t be on the street
1,8297,1821,8240,more efficient documentation - we fill out the same info on 5 different forms and it wastes time.
1,8298,1828,8236,Cowardice is unchallenged but action and progress are suspect and punished if any possibilty of liabilty is expected. Police work by nature is extreem liabilty.
1,8299,1815,8237,Senarios, hands on
1,8300,1824,8240,our audits are ridiculus. stop handicapping ourselves with criteria that have no practical basis. every arrest report has 5 or 6 pages of checklists for two pages of narrative on the elements of the crime.
1,8301,1800,8240,documentation is like writing a history book.  others will read your story and learn from mistakes and accomplishments.
1,8302,1823,8235,screw the politics, if a officer INTENTIONALLY screwed up then deal with it.  if not dont let department, city givernment politics get in the way of this officers punishment
1,8303,1817,8238,get rid of what doesn&#039;t work and keep what does
1,8304,1816,8299,what would those scenarios be about
1,8305,1822,8240,There should be more positive paperwork written on officers for commendable duties that were performed, and less negative written out of fear cya.
1,8306,1815,8238,need to discuss the pros &amp; cons of the mission and how we can improve for future missions.
1,8307,1818,8235,the majority of work in documentation in the lapd is redundant. We need to find a way to get real time information to the people inhte field when they need it. Intelligence gathered does nothing for anyone if it is not shared.
1,8308,1821,8240,I spend more time filling out forms to show I am using informants properly than I do actually talking to the informants to gather intelligence.
1,8309,1821,8246,I spend more time filling out forms to show I am using informants properly than I do actually talking to the informants to gather intelligence.
1,8310,1823,8304,ask scotty he knows how to use his hands
1,8311,1815,8237,Scenarios:  building searches, meaningful shooting training etc.
1,8312,1824,8238,after the rampart incident it seems like we stopped talking about tactical issues and only talk about covering yourself. we have to get back into a tactical mindset and talk about what works and what doesn&#039;t. in narcotics investigations specifically, we make a lot of the same mistakes over and over.
1,8313,1825,8241,I have found that communication is one of the biggest reasons for success and failures.  Great teamwork comes from knowing the mission and objectives, as well as the role of each individual.  There are no absolutes. Contigencies and  back up plans should be established prior to any mission and everyone needs to know what that is.  This will make the decisions much easier at a critical time.
1,8314,1821,8246,I would have 3 times the informants I currently have if there wasn&#039;t so much paperwork and time spent on the requirements to document and run them.
1,8315,1817,8237,more firearms and self defense training, and require officers to attend the training
1,8316,1800,8242,being simple with a task.  not confusing others.  giving responsiblity to specific officers.
1,8317,1810,8237,We receive alot of worthless training on sexual harrassment and other human relations crap. I don&#039;t know any officers that need to hear this stuff anymore.  I can&#039;t remember the last time I received any tactical training at Southeast.
1,8318,1822,8238,Does not have to happen when only a supervisor is present. Most leaders are amongst the troops and it is pride and the wanting to improve that should motivate to learn from a scene.
1,8319,1823,8244,trust that your fellow officer is not going to get mad because you felt they should have done something different or diid something unsafe,,,,the contents of the de brief is something that everybody can use as a rsource to base decisions on a future operation
1,8320,1818,8242,Blame game doesn&#039;t do anything except cause contempt betwen peers. Every person should now thier reponsibility and part in any mission. If you fail or fall short, accept it, fix it, and move on. This applies to all aspects, not just field duties.
1,8321,1824,8244,some officers get a polygraph and a second background check to work select assignments, while others are placed there with no additional scrutiny. having consistent standards would allow for more trust and better flow of communication.
1,8322,1826,8246,the units that have the intell doesn&#039;t share it instead it&#039;s kept like some big secert if patrol would received some intell from gangs,narcotics or whoever that intell could be used to make a bigger impact on crime
2,8323,0,0,messages to senior managers about the future
1,8324,1815,8246,Need a proper system for disseminating intelligence.
1,8325,1803,8244,you deal w real time info and on that info have the ability to make the decision and follow through w the decision. without the following day or even hours after having others criticize your decision or tell u how u should have hanlde the incident when they were not there and they have the luxelure not being in the field but to be behide a desk or in a safe envoriment.  its one thing making decision under fire and stress and its another with no stress and all the info being hand given to you the next day.  its also extrememly important to trust your peolpe and they will follow through with your directions without looking over their shoulders.  you after make decision with the info at hand right now because we deal with human lives and failure to make the decision can result in some getting hurt or killed.  you can not write a text book full of rules on how to deal with making real human deciion but the books sould be more of a guide line.  de briefing are where you learn alot of info what went right and what you could do better next time.  the day you think you know it all is the day you should quite because you are going to get yourself or your partner killed.   i do not care how many tactical situtations you have handled they are all different and no two are alike.  thats because of the human eliminate.
1,8326,1815,8239,Get a helmet that fits Stevens&#039; head
1,8327,1828,8236,Front line officers are used up as their liabilty to the Dept grows as a result of their hard work in the field.<br />The ofcr is recycled by a fresh new empty TEAMS report (new officer)<br />Risk officers are sent off to work undesired jobs that should be filled by the unmotivated. Experience of a veteran street officer has no value if they have hit the glass ceiling of liability to the Dept.
1,8328,1822,8244,To much paperwork, less checklists.
1,8329,1806,8239,allow officer to use the equipment/ tools in a real world/ real time manner.  Right now we have to fill out to many forms and ask for permission from to many people to conduct any type of undercover/ plain clothes operation.  The paperwork is to much of a burden and time consuming so the operation is abandonded.
1,8330,1800,8237,training that will help us with our current assignment or what we can use in the field.
1,8331,1827,8240,Mindless cross-refrencing of FDR numbers, 16 digit incident numbers, checklists and re-writing the same information in the ever expanding heading deep arrest reports goes far and beyond &quot;History book&quot; documentation.
1,8332,1815,8237,Current training sucks
1,8333,1818,8240,The biggest problem with documentation in the LAPD is that it is usually created by persons with no experience for the purposes of making someones desk job easier. In the mean time, a crackhead arrest just turned into a thirty page novel.
1,8334,1824,8323,stop making press releases. if you shut up, the problem will go away.
1,8335,1817,8241,get up to date information, daily, instead of listening to the same info in roll call for 3 weeks.
1,8336,1815,8245,give an example
1,8337,1826,8242,when objectives are given don&#039;t find fault with the officers when they accomplish the objective and complaints come out of it
1,8338,1821,8323,It seems as though the attitude is that the best decision is the one with the least resistance or the least possibility of an &quot;incident&quot;. Make the right decision for crime fighting and then dont be afraid to explain it and stand by it.
1,8339,1815,8264,Setup a Starbucks for management
1,8340,1800,8244,dont trust p-1&#039;s
1,8341,1822,8243,one time i asked a sargent 2 for a T/O but they couldn&#039;t make a decision a give it to me because the LT. was on a day off. we were 2 over by the way.
1,8342,1815,8239,Get Colomy a clean shower
1,8343,1816,8340,why?
1,8344,1827,8323,There are elements of our community that will never ever be happy with what we do. Stop catering to their every whim.
1,8345,1803,8237,having people willing to do the job because they want to do the job not for what they can get out of it.  the me society.
1,8346,1823,8338,Most came on this job to fight crime lawfully and doing so in a respectful manner. To most officers this IS the basis for coming on the job.  Remember this when judging us, it wasn&#039;t until you got promoted did DEPARTMENT politics start AFFECT YOUR DECISION.
1,8347,1800,8323,investigate first before you bad mouth an officer on the six oclock news......
1,8348,1821,8323,stop letting race politics pressure you into decisions. How is it possible for John Mack, the former Urban League president that has done nothing but make outrageous claims against the city and department, to lead the Police Commision without prejudice? It was done for race relations.
1,8349,1800,8323,give us back our flash lights
1,8350,1815,8323,Let Capts become Capts and run their Division without fearing upper management  micro-managing.
1,8351,1822,8323,MAN UP.
1,8352,1823,8336,READ WHAT COMS ATER THIS INPUT
1,8353,1828,8240,If I can go to Ikea online and click on 300 items to furnish a entire house or even a bldg,  and all those items will be shipped to my door from 30 diferent locations around the world, with all my information printed on them, then why at LAPD do we have to hand write the exact same information on 15 different police forms to finish a single arrest report.
1,8354,1825,8322,Feel free to stop by the gang office if there are questions or information you are trying to obtain. There is some intelligence that we feel reluctant to share w/ role call only because of the fact that Southeast has several new officers in the division that do not know how to work it successfuly. This intelligence could be lost if not worked correctly.
1,8355,1815,8323,Require all management to work the field one day a month
1,8356,1803,8237,80 percent of the department writes policy on how 20 percent of the department does the job.
1,8357,1824,8339,they couldn&#039;t decide what to order
1,8358,1818,8323,the current war on crime is a war that we are losing. its just going to get worse until the brass shuts up and lets the experts in law enforcement (Officers) do the job. The LAPD is stuck in  a time warp on how they police. Criminals have gotten smarter and we still do things the same old stupid ways. maybe the comand staff should stop competing against each other for who is going to be the next cheif and focus on whether or not there will be a city to police in the future. There are managers, supervisors and leaders. The sad part is that very few of our managers have enough fieldexperienceto be good leaders. 90 percent of you career being spent off the streets should prevent you from even being considered for promotion. unfortunatley that is the trend in the LAPD. if you dont know what its like being in the field, don&#039;t try to tell me how to do my job.
1,8359,1821,8323,reward and promote officers that are hard chargers and take chances. Yes, they will have more complaints and blemishes in their backrounds, but that shows you were out there working and learning. Not just on a fast track for promotion.
1,8360,1817,8323,officers that don&#039;t want to work should never be allowed in south burea
1,8361,1824,8134,support your police officers, not the criminals
1,8362,1816,7681,The timeline of the investigation was pushed primarily by the COP who sometimes made unrealistic promises without even discussing the promises with the active investigators first.  We must learn to balance what is ideal and what is realistic and err on the side of realistic.
1,8363,1816,7726,In many instances the biases were not real but perception.  Because of that perception we diluted parts of the investigation.
1,8364,1816,7683,There were simply too many hands in the pot.  When someone did not agree with a specific thought then it was said that they were biased or they had lost objectivity.  Let the investigators do their JOB, just like any other case.
1,8365,1816,7714,The final decision of the case was based on the facts of the case.  Those facts were evaluated and found to have merit.  The police department could not survive if we had an abundance of officers who responded in the same manner under the same circumstance.
1,8366,1816,7686,Discipline in this case should have extended further to some of the other people involved.  I think the Department and its officers could gain more from this incident.  In the future it should be broken down and its findings explained to everyone.
1,8367,1816,7767,This is absolute crap.  I think it had nothing to do with race, nothing to do with resentment and more to do with communications and a hidden agenda.  The advocate did not communicate with the investigators to tell them what he wanted, who was coming next, and why things were done a certain way.  This led to confusion and the perception of intentional exclusion and when the investigators backed away, there was a cry of fowl.  If we had applied standard practice to the entire process, all of the above problems could have been eliminated.

1,8430,1855,8373,why will this work better than previous prorammes
1,8431,1850,8373,values come and go with each new commissioner. why should this be any different
1,8432,1852,8375,To many barriers for all of us to work together - values also are vastly differfent,
1,8433,1845,8375,Together is a great concept but there are many communication barriers that stop/slow this down.
1,8434,1860,8373,is the wheel being re invented
1,8435,1859,8376,nice hair cut guv!
1,8436,1843,8373,After a short time will the new values have as little credibility as in the past
1,8437,1855,8375,&#039;team met&#039; will only catch on because it&#039;s such an awful phrase
1,8438,1860,8373,why is always the mistakes, what about praise
1,8439,1854,8374,Do the public care what our slogan is?
1,8440,1840,8375,I am sick of seeing our &quot;leaders&quot; portfolio stuffing  collecting evidence for the next rank.
1,8441,1851,8373,I think staff have a lack of belief in the values of the organisation because they seem to be re-invented every few years.
1,8442,1845,8376,Places on Leadership courses are very difficult to get.
1,8443,1841,8375,Is Together a programme, ethos or something else?  People, including line managers like to give things labels.  I think some may have difficulty getting into the subject if they are uncertain as to what label to give it.
1,8444,1856,8373,Do good? Do bad?????
1,8445,1852,8376,Let&#039;s have leaders that are capable and lead by example.  They need to be guided by rules.  Punish when needed but praise where required.
1,8446,1842,8373,whilst each tries to achieve the organisation&#039;s values everyone brings their own values to the organisation also - taken into account ?
1,8447,1859,8375,rewards based on overtime or rank structure.  promotion systems very transactional.
1,8448,1839,8375,you won&#039;t achieve team met until supervisors start supervising
1,8449,1861,8373,dps are one of the largest groups in the Met?? are we so bad?? service reveiw cops back on the streets
1,8450,1847,8374,Is there going to be the finance to back this idea up?
1,8451,1843,8375,Met is too unwieldy a beast. Too many leaders with selfish agendas. The silos will never go away, but I congratulate you for at least trying
1,8452,1850,8375,silos - in an organisation that employs 40k people surely its only natural that we gravitate towards our own small team/unit etc. you cant overcome basic human nature
1,8453,1860,8373,does any other job you have spoken too deal with problems at 0330 on a wet cold decmber day
1,8454,1859,8375,Too few resources being chased
1,8455,1856,8376,Senior managers should trust their staff.
1,8456,1853,8376,The Met does not have many dynamic leaders. The type that leads by example. The Commissioner has bitten into a big chunk of change here. The Met is a behemoth with too many Deptartments all with their own interests.<br />Leaders; good dynamis leaders; that&#039;s what we need.
1,8457,1858,8376,The concept of teamwork is not encouraged
1,8458,1855,8375,we have values, priorities, a mission, a vision, corporate priorities, local priorities.  Which are we supposed to be working to?
1,8459,1865,8451,thanks for the support, the first postive statement - Jonathan
1,8460,1849,8376,No feedbackfromany of my leaders that have been involved in this process
1,8461,1842,8433,i agree with this - both internal and externally there are barriers and a lack of positive promotion all around
1,8462,1843,8376,Too many hypocrites in high ranks not leading by example
1,8463,1852,8373,When we were a disciplined force officers had pride in their selves and in the job.  Since becoming a servic we have lost our pride and respect.
1,8464,1859,8373,second value is going to cause some difficulty for a lot of senior officers in the mps.
1,8465,1847,8376,As soon as someone deviates from the transformational image of the highest manager, they (the highest manager) becomes very transactional!!
1,8466,1852,8376,The MPS are frightened of saying and doing the right thing for fear of savingface to the public
1,8467,1860,8373,who did you ask and had the police had bad press the day before
1,8468,1848,8373,If these are the values people are already working to, then they must be very relevant!
1,8469,1861,8374,surveys are crap, if you give someone a form to fill in they will fill in the boxes and generally give it no thought? night duty 0300 in the morning what response to a survey do you think you will get
1,8470,1843,8374,Graphs are fairly meaningless.
1,8471,1844,8375,We are frightened of our own shadows.....we don&#039;t police anymore
1,8472,1855,8373,how are we going to monitor whether these values are being applied
1,8473,1859,8373,time for the mps to make a major leap of faith and progress people who have/display values that we expouse to support.
1,8474,1845,8373,Sometimes I think I&#039;m working for a different organisation to my colleagues because they see the Values with cynicism.
1,8475,1862,8375,Convincing staff of these values when there have been so many other values and mission statements in the past
1,8476,1849,8374,these issues will not be very relevant to staff about to be relocated as part of the service review
1,8477,1854,8373,The presentation started with negative comments about the two framed values statements on the walls in this room.  We are responding to the tone the speaker has set.
1,8478,1850,8375,as long as people are being beaten up by those in authority above them in respect of targets there will be  a major barrier to this whole programme.
1,8479,1843,8375,How does towbar fit into this, it is clearly a portfolio evidence gathering process
1,8480,1852,8374,The public will never consent to being arrested therefore we will always have to enforce the rule!  they do not care about buzz words or slogans just getting an officer when they want one , so lets do the job thats required and stop pussy footing around.
1,8481,1855,8373,It IS disrespectful to be typing whislt someone is talking. I will not be doing it agin today!
1,8482,1848,8375,Do we fail to walk the talk, because we are not fully commited to what is being said?
1,8483,1860,8373,we should be speaking to the public  for instance traff pol doing speeds by camera and not actually talking to the driver is not good,  A money making scheme but not good for the public imiage
1,8484,1844,8373,Never in all my service have I been asked what I value and respect..........get back to the grass roots and you WILL move forward.
1,8485,1850,8376,Lack of inspiration/lack of commercial awareness
1,8486,1845,8375,Walking the Talk - I don&#039;t believe people go out of their way not to do something. There are clearly barriers stopping people responding to others.
1,8487,1843,8375,Do the MPA know where we are wishing to go as an organisation as this will need funds that they are unwilling to provide
1,8488,1853,8376,How many times have I seen our leaders nod their head to an idea and the do nothing at all? How many actually take action? How many say &#039;well done&#039;?
1,8489,1859,8471,i think the public response to how we acted on 7/7 shows that we do still police and we have the backing of the public.
1,8490,1851,8373,I think the organisation is in danger of losing the respect of the public it serves because of endless discussions/programmes of this nature. At a time when we are at a heightened state of alert I think the people of London would view this process with a great deal of cynicism
1,8491,1850,8373,Values shouls carry equal importance as performance ability at PDR
1,8492,1852,8376,Lets get rid of the dead wood and &quot;old values&quot; and start working together.  There is a solution, plenty of people in the the Met know what it is - but they are not being listened to.
1,8493,1861,8375,performance data, forcing cops to Police in a way that can be counterproductive, if you want 5 process a month I will stand outside a school and stick on every normally law abiding parent for parking on the pavement and seat belts, alienating the local public, therefore counterprductive when working as a source handler
1,8494,1853,8375,Police staff status? What status?
1,8495,1865,8481,this is ok, you will always have time to add more after the presentation, however this process captures the real feel of the group, keep with it please
1,8496,1860,8373,did you paid for the 12 hours if not why not
1,8497,1854,8376,Where do Govt turn to when they need to kick ass?  Immigration? Do they turn to IND? No, they set up Reflex/Maxim and the Met does it.  Counter-terrorism?   Is it led by X - Shire Constabulary? No that&#039;s the Met too.  Want more examples?  I could go on...
1,8498,1849,8375,Itis interesting that your comments about hours worked are raised in connection to Police Staff.  What happened to team met?
1,8499,1845,8375,Sometimes &#039;politics&#039; is used as an excuse for inaction. Assumptions are made and not challenged.
1,8500,1859,8375,why do we still make the distincion between police oficers and police staff and why do we continue to require police officers to wear uniform inside offices and when not meeting the publc?
1,8501,1852,8375,Supervision is too laxed, or there are too many chiefs.  Tighter control is required throughout.
1,8502,1843,8375,ACPO ranks have achieved success by transactional leadership so will they support the signigicant change in leadership style or will they just protect themselves and talk the talk not walk the walk
1,8503,1848,8375,This organisation has a presentee culture, you are rewarded in the main for the time you spend at work, not for the results you achieve.
1,8504,1854,8489,We&#039;re unbeatable at the big stuff...It&#039;s the day to day bread and butter we need to improve on.
1,8505,1840,8375,Too much change when new senior managers change and impose their bright ideas
1,8506,1839,8375,stick to plain english
1,8507,1859,8376,you make me want to come to work guv!
1,8508,1851,8487,I don&#039;t think the MPA live in the real world. They are politicians who are there purely to pursue their own careers/re-election. I don&#039;t think they have a very good grasp of reality
1,8509,1847,8373,Thank God that now, at least we are starting to do something towards improving our values.<br />No one should expect that it to improve over night, but at least it&#039;s the beginning of the end of the old system.<br />Let&#039;s all go for it !!
1,8510,1860,8373,I think we are still supported by the silent majority and do the job very well
1,8511,1856,8373,value performance, personality and ability instead of rank. The need to train in uniform......necessary?
1,8512,1852,8376,Very few have pride and passion now in the Met.
1,8513,1844,8373,People in this room are now transfixed on the computer screens......not on the speaker...........so what is his value ?
1,8514,1856,8374,This is not working.
1,8515,1853,8375,We seem to do the big &#039;front page&#039; things extremely well. The normal day-to-day business sems to get forgotten. Look at the Constabularies performance figures. We are close to the bottom of the league.
1,8516,1845,8375,What are the reasons for people losing that &#039;drive&#039; that they started with?
1,8517,1857,8375,Consistency between managers! whatever next????
1,8518,1859,8374,Why has it become necessary to spell out our values? Does society need to be taught values?
1,8519,1850,8500,when police staff are subjected to the same operational pressures and stresses as police officers and when they are subject to the same discipline code as us, then we can talk about getting rid of the distinctions that exist.
1,8520,1865,8513,this is ok because the speaker has set up the session to deal with the issues, he will value the input, this is a tried and tested approach, you need to run with it for a bit
1,8521,1864,8375,Performance indicators that do not measure quality and focus on short term crude measures without acknowledgement of the complexities of policing will always be barriers to living these values.
1,8522,1849,8374,Font too smallto read from here
1,8523,1848,8376,Are people afraid to challenge behaviour because they feel they will nt be suppoted?
1,8524,1851,8515,I think the performance figures are a little unfair, they don&#039;t properly take in to account the size of the force. HMIC said that had we been an &#039;ordinary&#039; sized force we would have received an &#039;excellent&#039; rating.
1,8525,1856,8376,Sorry.......never experienced this from senior management
1,8526,1859,8373,when you have to state what we will not do you creative a negative aspect to this process.
1,8527,1839,8494,stop moaning and get on with the job like the rest of us
1,8528,1852,8375,Instead of giving in to public opinion,  We have a national set of rules that we follow and enforce.  So lets have senior officers that stand up and say to the public the Police have enforced YOUR rules so stop moaning about it and let us get on with the job.
1,8529,1858,8375,We can&#039;t expect the public&#039;s perception to change until we deal with internal issues.  The answer comes from within.
1,8530,1843,8375,I have had bitter personal experience of challenging.I have had my legs done. I will never do it again.
1,8531,1861,8375,Sorry, tell that to the poor cop who shot the guy at stockwell, how long will the discipline process against him take, will he be allowed to say sorry for making a mistake, probably not
1,8532,1860,8373,why should we
1,8533,1855,8492,I agree.  There are still to many dinosaurs out there who cannot bring theselves into the 21st century
1,8534,1852,8462,Any change that goes against the &quot;norm&quot; gets challenged or stopped.  No one is listening.
1,8535,1865,8532,why shouldn&#039;t we?
1,8536,1859,8376,good luck on making an impact on command level
1,8537,1854,8373,Challenge upwards?  Do they still summon SMT members to TPHQ for a bashing up - COMPSTAT?  How about a Supt giving the AC some feedback at one of those meetings.  Do you think it would be well received?
1,8538,1841,8373,Happy with values,  their relevance to staff and their relevance to the community we serve.  Where we need to do better is around making the values part of everyday activity for managers and staff.  For many this may simply be the opportunity to demonstrate they live the values without concern of derision.  This is the responsibility of the manager to set the right environment.
1,8539,1852,8376,There are over 13,000 police staff in the Met, they should be recognised for the work they do.
1,8540,1858,8376,There are only very few bad apples.. most people I have worked with have the sames values as me ..
1,8541,1855,8376,Don&#039;t we have the &#039;sir&#039; and &#039;madam&#039; because the MPS is still supposed to be a disciplined force?
1,8542,1866,8376,little people management skills provided
1,8543,1856,8376,If you respect and value your staff and give rewards along the way, the rewards you will get as a manager in return will far exceed those you give.....try it and see!
1,8544,1860,8373,are we not working well..............
1,8545,1839,8373,The service needs to maintain discipline, otherwise no-one will respond to commands at critical incidents
1,8546,1845,8376,I have only attended courses that are compulsory for all, not the courses that I actually need/want to develop my skills.
1,8547,1854,8510,Until they get GATSO&#039;d
1,8548,1859,8376,if you come to work because of the people you work with you must have a masocistic streak.
1,8549,1840,8516,Bashed to of them by poor managers.  We need some leaders who inspire!
1,8550,1855,8543,totally agree.  I do it and it works
1,8551,1856,8374,I think I need 10,000 pints already!
1,8552,1841,8491,Perhaps not equal, butI agree some form of formal recognition would raise the profile of the values.
1,8553,1843,8373,How can you control and regulate 30,000 plus different personalities and attitudes? Scary thought!!
1,8554,1852,8376,Why do we bother with PDR&#039;s if a person is under performing then sort it out when it&#039;s happening ,don&#039; wait for a year and then criticise at a yearly review. the system is Rubbish.
1,8555,1846,8463,The change from a force to a service should be about the way we relate to each other and the public, not about losing pride in ourselves as individuals and the way we do the job.
1,8556,1851,8539,I very much agree with this statement. I don&#039;t think police staff are valued highly enough by the organisation. The service is still highly officer focused.
1,8557,1845,8376,Why do we go external for faciliation/consultants? We have 40,000 people with very different opinions and skills. Why can&#039;t we use these?
1,8558,1842,8375,why not consider that you may never get it right? an organisation of 40,000  over 620 square miles is dynamic and changing all the time  - responsive to the community, politics, internal, external influences.  get it right today but it won&#039;t be right tomorrow
1,8559,1866,8376,too Rank Band driven - lack of equality in the workplace
1,8560,1849,8376,more external consultants will just soak up vast amounts of our limited budget and what extra do they bring?
1,8561,1839,8373,Why have we all of a sudden become &quot;Cops&quot; instead of police officers???
1,8562,1852,8376,Why bring in external consultants (at a massive cost to the service) where there are peoplem within the Met that can assist and give you the benefit of their experience from within.
1,8563,1859,8375,lets stop trying to re-invent the wheel and look at oher successful organisations, cherry pick from them, but do not forget to look internally to pick out what is working in the mps.
1,8564,1851,8554,Because this system never worked, people never got appropriate feedback to help them improve.
1,8565,1860,8373,evry thing going really well, the training is on course and every one is warned to attend BUT its all cancelled for AID next week, it never gets rescehduled
1,8566,1850,8556,funny that! Police service that focuses on police officers. whatever next?
1,8567,1841,8376,Agree with external accreditation.
1,8568,1852,8374,PDR&#039;s maybe required - to monitor an officer/staff&#039;s peformance.  BUT they are never done on time, and they all turn up in the last week of the year for review.
1,8569,1847,8554,You&#039;re understanding of the PDR system is wrong. It is a &#039;living document&#039; and performance issues should be dealt with at the time. It is not like the APA procedures!!
1,8570,1845,8560,I agree. I&#039;m sure Met people will understand the issues much better than external consultants, and they want the chance to influence the organisation. That could help them feel valued.
1,8571,1849,8374,Many staff have already gained these qualifactions but are ignored in favour of External Consultants.  This is a double waste of money.
1,8572,1848,8375,Peolpe will put themselves first and the organisation second until the service recognises people in a tangible way for delivering a quality of service to the public.  Currently your earnings are primarily effected by promotion or the amount of time you are &#039;booked on&#039;.  What rewards do we give to people who provide a very high quality of service in their current role during their rostered working day?
1,8573,1860,8373,but where is the uniform officer on the street  where the PUBLIC who pays us wants to see us dealing with THEIR problems
1,8574,1854,8375,Time for a bit of honesty.  There&#039;s no such thing as altruism.  We&#039;re all come to work for what&#039;s in it for ourselves.  If you want me to buy in - tell me what&#039;s in it for me.
1,8575,1844,8573,Sat in this room being asked to think outside the box !!!
1,8576,1859,8506,this process should have a degree of professional academic phrases as we need to become a part of the dialogue which occurs across the professional development community nationally and worldwide.
1,8577,1842,8374,Are u talking to the Crime Academy - they are also developing external accreditations and conducting on-line training?
1,8578,1852,8375,Why after twenty three years service are my details still being inputted incorrectly?  TOPSY/PIMS/MET HR.  the system do&#039;s not work, or should personnel be renamed Impersonnel.
1,8579,1861,8375,Web forums???  aware is too restrictive with its firewall if you have the word bum deal it will pick up the first word and block and send a report to the firewall manager,
1,8580,1858,8546,I don&#039;t think this applies to everyone.  Certainly not my personal experience...
1,8581,1853,8375,PoliceStaff are still second-class citizens. The Met talks a good talk but has never delivered on this major issue,
1,8582,1855,8375,will we go back to a single training department.  I work in training but even I can&#039;t get to grips with all the different units/academies/silos, all of whom do things differently.  I never know who to take my queries to.
1,8583,1854,8376,Well done for standing up there and giving it your best.  That was a thankless task and you did it well.
1,8584,1840,8376,Can we get rid of the Old boy network, promoting people in your own image, carriers on the poor leadership we already have.
1,8585,1861,8442,have tried for 6 months to get officers on a course
1,8586,1866,8376,great ideas but with the size of this organisation how long will this take to role out to everyone?
1,8587,1845,8376,If we introduce the Leadership courses as well as the management courses, we must give it time to filter through. Think of all those people who have not received this training. It will take time to improve.
1,8588,1852,8376,You can provide all the development training tyou want for band D and Sergeants.  B ut a the end of the day, they will only use the lack of it as an excuse. Majority do not want any more responsibility - only to do their job and go home
1,8589,1860,8373,whats wrong with disipline
1,8590,1840,8494,No one will give Police staff status, it needs to be taken!  It isn&#039;t something that is given it needs to be siezed.
1,8591,1861,8488,can the phrase, &quot;i hear what your saying but &quot; be banned from senior and acpo vocabulary
1,8592,1842,8441,i agree i think people need consistency from the mps - this leads to confidence in the organisation and therefrom loyalty
1,8593,1858,8522,get some glasses !
1,8594,1852,8376,Grevience and other processes takes too long!
1,8595,1859,8376,I disagree that leadership begins when you first join. I believe that those selected have the qualities to take control of a situation but do not begin to lead until they enter the promotion arena or supervise others
1,8596,1845,8586,I think this is a good idea, but we must give it time to be rolled out. There is no point introducing it, then dropping it for a new idea in a couple of years.
1,8597,1854,8493,What get measured gets done.  Whether the public like it or not.
1,8598,1850,8376,Senior managers do not recognise the expertise held within their depts - all too often technical people are forced into doing Admin roles and not utilising their core skills. Overall provides a very poor allocation of scarce resources.
1,8599,1844,8544,No.............we work for our own self gains not for the good of others.....that is the culture this job breeds........change that and we may have a fighting chance.
1,8600,1853,8374,What do we do to consult our customer THE PUBLIC? The people who we are supposed to protect and serve? When they are asked we don&#039;t like the answers!
1,8601,1864,8376,first line managers may benefit from contacts with forward thinking private companies .
1,8602,1845,8588,So, they need to be persuaded that their job is worth doing well, so its not just a matter of turning up. How will the training make it easier for them - that&#039;s what we should be stressing.
1,8603,1860,8537,whats COMPSTAT
1,8604,1861,8541,no officers have the Queens Commision like Army Officers, so they do not have the right to be called Sir or Maam, as this refers to the Queens Commision and not the person.
1,8605,1859,8373,why do staff think it is appropriate to attend events like this in jeans, go to asda and buy yourself a suit, we need professional values and professional image.
1,8606,1846,8375,How can people work to common goals when so many are worried about their jobs with the service review and budget saving exercises?
1,8607,1839,8581,It will not improve until the new breed of senior officer emerges
1,8608,1851,8566,This is exactly the sort of thing the service needs to overcome if it is going to recruit highly trained/motivated people as staff. The officer first culture is extremely damaging to the service&#039;s ability to recruit appropriately trained people.
1,8609,1843,8530,Surely with a change of culture you could feel confident to try again otherwise this whole process is worthless
1,8610,1859,8474,i agree with you, but chinks of light are appearing, keep up the good fight.
1,8611,1864,8376,Each Borough or OCU must have a champion that moves these issues on or they will fail
1,8612,1840,8375,Too many levels of management that all seem to have diffirent messages to send out
1,8613,1845,8601,external mentoring is very useful. It takes you out of the situation and gives you a very different perspective. This would also enhance relations with outside organisations. However, mentoring is seen as a weakness in the Met. Why?
1,8614,1853,8376,This Commissioner is trying hard to achieve change but it is like steering a battleship thro&#039; heavy seas and trying to turn without capsizing. There is too much cynicism in the Met.
1,8615,1858,8591,I second that !
1,8616,1841,8469,I think this comment unfair.  Many people do see the value.  The sample size is sufficiently large to indicate what MPS staff think and that people care enough to complete the survey in the first place.
1,8617,1843,8611,That champion must be the OCU commander otherwise destined to fail
1,8618,1867,8373,another new set of clothes for the king.  The fundamental problem remains.  Insufficient budget to provide a professional response, leads to the de-valuing of the individual.
1,8619,1859,8477,i think no disrespect to the values was intended only tha manner in which they have not been effectively communicated and intergrated across the mps.
1,8620,1868,8374,Most people I have spoken to think that we&#039;re doing a great job.  We should build on our successes, not focus on failures.
1,8621,1856,8543,Great....please encourage more managers to follow suit
1,8622,1861,8546,I agree to a point mandatory training is easy to get on as it is a statistic of perfomance management and OCU commanders dont like explaining why their Offciers are not up to date, shame they dont have to answer when an Officer has not had the opportunity to train for a post outside his current position
1,8623,1858,8512,They do, but it is not &#039;cool&#039; to show it ..
1,8624,1844,8531,Yes.........he will get all the support he needs........I think not...........history just repeats itself in this job.
1,8625,1842,8374,why do different people join the mps? some are officers, some are filing clerks, some are technical or transport.  there is not one ring to rule them all, one ring to bind them.  it is too difficult to compare the needs and requirements of commander messinger (42 years service) with the office girl who joins because she lives next door to bromley police station and wants to walk to work
1,8626,1860,8537,Theres a lot of big words in the police service what do they mean this squad and hat squad lets get the officers back on the street with support be it help with paper work transport etc etc
1,8627,1866,8376,any comments/grievances made to your line magr are not private - they have to be rpeorted
1,8628,1859,8589,nothing were it is appropriate but a lot of damage has been done in the past.
1,8629,1855,8581,not in my experience they are not.
1,8630,1854,8557,That&#039;s what the CCRU do now, very well.  We should develop this further.  With over 20 yrs experience, I have developed contacts who help me in my job every day from law enforcement and commerce/industry.  I know loads of us have such contacts - we should pool them in a similar way to the CCRU and spread the burden of policing by getting everyone we know who are willing to help us to do so.
1,8631,1866,8376,PDR rubbish - comments I made were never acrted on. Your our not rewarded for good performance
1,8632,1859,8376,i do not mind what you call me as long as my rank is shown on my pay packet, in my pension and an appropriate level of renumeration matching responsibilities.
1,8633,1857,8594,Fully agree, after implementing it myself. Also believe many will not commence it due to time / work involved resulting in no action being taken
1,8634,1859,8371,respect and support has to extend to when errors are made, when genuine mistakes are made, as well as when performing well.
1,8635,1857,8371,Support in terms of training also needs to be available and timely.
1,8636,1859,8371,Be flexible and make differences work for you
1,8637,1857,8371,Time needs to be available to be able to provide support.
1,8638,1858,8370,I agree .. but some people just don&#039;t listen
1,8639,1842,8372,Encourage positive thinking and provide training for the individual
1,8640,1873,8371,Everybody has a skill, utilise it and develop their lack of expertise in other areas.<br />Police Staff do not just have to do Police Staff jobs, encourage them to be flexible and integrate them into your team, you may be supprised at the results
1,8641,1842,8372,Thinking outside the box and willing to look and explore new ways of looking at experiences
1,8642,1845,8371,The course would have a coaching element to it. Team members will be trained to coach each other, trying to get each other to help ourselves.
1,8643,1842,8372,Provide training for the individual to enable them to deal with negativity and &#039;anti&#039; mentality in a &#039;team&#039; situation.
1,8644,1840,8370,We need some good examples of listening and responding, to build confidence.  Which would lead to more talk.
1,8645,1859,8637,when a challenging mangerial issue occurs leaders need to be given time to devote to solutions, too often they either have to push the issues to one side while they concentrate on other tasks, or other work suffers because of the considerable amount of time some issues require.  I regularly spend 25% of my time dealing with development and personnal issues of my staff, yet this is not reflected in the structure of my workload.
1,8646,1855,8372,We must learn to acknowledge positive and developmental experiences before we can learn from them. Any training must start from here.
1,8647,1850,8370,regular team meetings. 2 way process without fear of censure.
1,8648,1852,8369,Enthusiasm, Enthusiasm, Enthusiasm

1,8651,1844,8369,Inspired thought
1,8652,1856,8369,Set the tone and motivate the group
1,8653,1844,8369,Opening and closure of courses by a senior manager, give due recognition for the efforts put in by staff members.
1,8654,1856,8369,Exercise to identify inspirational leader - explain to group what makes the individual inspirational to you - e.g. PS Foundation Course.
1,8655,1844,8369,Upto date needs analysis
1,8656,1842,8372,Training Module
1,8657,1842,8656,Identify the experience.  Any occurence that has learning potential is an &#039;experience&#039;.
1,8658,1856,8654,Group exercise to breakdown to the key qualities that link all these inspirational leaders.
1,8659,1840,8370,The course should be managed to reflect the values.  ie. The course should have the ability to run a 10 K volt style exercise which is confidential, and reports directly to the most senior levels in the MPS.
1,8660,1840,8659,There needs to be an efficient feed back procees to ensure what is said on the course is heard by the centre.
1,8661,1844,8369,Needs basis training
1,8662,1856,8369,Discuss what quality policing means within the group.  Emphasise differences and focus on public.
1,8663,1856,8369,Exercise to get people think about why they are a member of the organisation and why they want to lead people.
1,8664,1856,8649,Trainers also need to be inspirational - role not rank.
1,8665,1842,8656,How to categorise negative and positive outcomes and to recognise the learning potential in both.
1,8666,1856,8664,This will require suitable investment in the development of the trainer.
1,8667,1857,8637,Understand the benefits of team work.
1,8668,1852,8369,History of the Met, building upon their successes
1,8669,1852,8369,Learning from our mistakes
1,8670,1844,8369,You are going to train people well for that specific role instead of a carper generic input.
1,8671,1844,8369,Specialist roles need specialist training and beyond that maintain those skills.
1,8672,1852,8369,Motivate people on why they feel good about their job
1,8673,1873,8371,Awareness of differing procedures for Police Staff and Officers. Induction for new managers Police Staff and Officers integrated
1,8674,1844,8369,Establish external and credible agencies within the service to give expert opinion and input.
1,8675,1856,8664,Exercise into psychology of people focussing on what motivates people.
1,8676,1840,8370,No trust without valuing the diffrent parts of the MPS
1,8677,1852,8369,Line Management Support
1,8678,1856,8369,End of course action plan to take back to line manager.
1,8679,1856,8678,This should include some form of contract with line manager to allow candidate to try out new ideas from course.
1,8680,1849,8369,More input by experienced credible speakers/experts telling officers how it really is. Relating it to the students specific role.
1,8681,1844,8649,Break the barriers down between inter departmental barriers.
1,8682,1842,8656,Determine in what ways the &#039;experience&#039; (mean average) is negative/positive for the individual, team, unit, bocu, organisation in order to determine whether the &#039;experience&#039; was overall negative or positive.
1,8683,1873,8673,Flexible working, Attendance managment, Fairness at work, PDR&#039;s, diversity input from DCC4, CCRU, Staff association, OH, Metair, Explore modern trends in leadership,
1,8684,1842,8657,Each delegate should bring one positive and one negative experience for analysis and discussion
1,8685,1849,8369,Courses would be more valued if opened and closed by a senior officer.<br />In opening the course they could emphasise the relevance and motivate.<br />In closing it they could congratulate their success and impart a willingness to build on those foundations.
1,8686,1842,8665,The delegates as a group will review examples together and identify learning potentials
1,8687,1857,8371,Know what other support is available, ie mentor, first contact officer.
1,8688,1852,8680,Encouragement to progress through the service
1,8689,1842,8682,Delegates will be able to grade experiences from individual level to organisational level (subjective to objective grading)
1,8690,1873,8371,Signposting to self development areas, eg: coaching, mentoring, conflict management and resolution.
1,8691,1856,8678,We would challenge the premise that leaders must be Band D / PS - people below this level can also be managers/leaders.
1,8692,1844,8649,Role plays within the training remit need to be more realistic and deveoplmental. We need to move away from huddling in little groups writing on a flip chart.
1,8693,1840,8370,A learning organisation allows people to make mistakes, there is loads of learning from mistakes.  This organisation whilst badging itself as a learning organisation is riddled with blame culture.  Our supervisors need the support to allow them to make brave leadership decisions and be bold.
1,8694,1858,8370,Need to teach basic listening skills
1,8695,1860,8370,action plan for disappointment
1,8696,1873,8371,Role specific , eg PC/DC/D&#039;s in supervisory roles
1,8697,1868,8370,Use team exercises to demonstrate the positive and negative effects of communication.
1,8698,1849,8369,Big picture excercise, for example.... dividing a painting into smaller frames and asking individuals to complete a singular frame. Each frame then goes into the &#039;big picture&#039;. Each individual can complete their frame in what ever manner they feel eg.. collage, oil painting, water colours etc.<br />This would emphasise the relevance of each role within the bigger picture and the possibility of completing the task in very different ways.
1,8699,1858,8370,Use exercises to build trust
1,8700,1857,8371,Mobile courses, to accommodate place of work / residence.
1,8701,1856,8649,Opening intro from an inspirational leader with a connection to London
1,8702,1857,8700,Availability of part time courses
1,8703,1842,8656,Return to work for &#039;experience&#039; gathering
1,8704,1868,8370,Use case studies to illustrate the importance of trust in the relationship between line managers and staff.
1,8705,1858,8370,Teach people how to deal and respond with positive and negative issues
1,8706,1859,8700,courses that accomodate flexible hours of work, possibly spread over shorter days.  courses which take into account term times.
1,8707,1844,8649,Break down the fear factors this job appears to promote.........
1,8708,1876,8369,Building trust across departments/units.  Some leaders may come into conflict due to a lack of knowledge of other departments responsibilities or remits.  An exercise to break down this lack of trust /knowledge may be to split a class into syndicates and provide each with a different remit which ultimately may come into conflict with other syndicates. However each remit is aiming to achieve a common objective.  Only by open and clear communication can the task be achieved and this would be identified in plenary feedback if the objective was achieved or not.
1,8709,1859,8700,consider having an accademic year, gaps in august, december.
1,8710,1842,8703,Delegates will be required again to submit one negative and one positive experience and to outline by example how the &#039;experiences&#039; fit into the &#039;experience model&#039; and to show how they converted a negative experience to positive
1,8711,1842,8682,Delegates will be required to grade all experiences with a 2 x positive, 1 x negative rating
1,8712,1856,8369,Chatham House rules
1,8713,1868,8370,Media training
1,8714,1859,8700,improved standard of accomodation and facilities, incorporate hydra, interactive training.  consider running courses with outside bodies or in their accomodation, e.g. local colleges of further education.
1,8715,1842,8656,Call-back Day
1,8716,1851,8370,Combat cynicism. Convince participants of the value of the course by responding to their concerns. The course would incorporate role play exercises that would maybe include a demonstration of a poor interview and include feed back. There would be a large focus on freedom of speech. There should be an obligation for senior management managment to actively participate. There should be a section on the roles and responsibilities of line managers.The course could also benefit from a view of management from outside the service, perhaps particularly from outside the public sector. There should be a mandatory requirement for all police staff to attend. When police staff sign up to courses and do not attend, this creates a sense of divide within the service.
1,8717,1857,8635,Introduction to management courses are usually only available over 6 month after promotion.  A Band D has been waiting 2 years (and is still waiting!).
1,8718,1849,8369,Continually upsetting the apple cart scenario. A group start a task, part way through some of the group are changed but the task has to contiue. This change of indivduals in the group keeps going on a regular basis so that the completion of the task is done by a completely different group of individuals than started it.
1,8719,1873,8700,Timings??
1,8720,1840,8370,Ask individuals to identify three major issues about working in the MPS that personally affect them.<br />Compare responses and identify common themes.
1,8721,1860,8370,I would like to see a commitment from all senior managers to open the courses.  The managers attendance or non attendance should be published on the Intranet to let the organisation see who is commited and who is not.
1,8722,1860,8370,The course should be pre promotion and compulsory for police officers and police staff.
1,8723,1860,8694,Probably needs basic communication skills not just listening.
1,8724,1860,8638,Listening is our job, what are they doing if they can&#039;t listen?
1,8725,1868,8694,Follow-up sessions should be offered so attendees can assess their progress and revisit skills/areas that need attention.
1,8726,1860,8676,No valuing without knowing where the organisation is going, and what part they play in the scheme.
1,8727,1867,8370,&quot;mine is the only role that&#039;s important, why am I not supported&quot;.  This blinkered view is common and reflects a lack of communication and diversity of experience.  Specialism within a field or experience within a community is vital to a professional service but can become introspective.  A course that widens the perspective of the individual and offers insight into alternative resposibilities would be of value.  This could involve community based projects or short term diverse responsibilities within the service.
1,8728,1860,8699,What sort of exercises?
1,8729,1860,8705,Got an example?
1,8730,1852,8681,No one will do this for you - make the stance, encourage others to do the same
1,8731,1852,8692,No role plays - bring the training upto date (like today with PC&#039;s)  Show a clip, made by actors (or budding actors within MPS) then get feedack.
1,8732,1859,8371,thank you for a good lunch and for allowing time to enjoy it.  i feel respected and supported due to this.
1,8733,1852,8369,Soft skills training is also required
1,8734,1858,8728,plane crash survival scenario
1,8735,1852,8369,Target people who want to be there and want to take what they have learnt further.  Management &quot;buy in&quot; is essential.
1,8736,1860,8727,I think it is important to retain our specialities, but there are common threads through leadership which can be applied.
1,8737,1858,8729,something like the part 2 OSPRE training- learn to tell staff they need to &#039;develop&#039; in a certain area and praise when due
1,8738,1840,8370,Ask people to give an example of a negative experience they have had in the MPS and how it was dealt with compared to how they wanted it to be dealt with.
1,8739,1852,8685,Disagree
1,8740,1875,8685,Osama Bin Laden is an inspirational leader. Discuss.    How about that for an ice breaker?
1,8741,1856,8654,Groups present their findings and discuss to produce an agreed set of qualities and values the group can sign up to.
1,8742,1859,8371,course content in regard to how to manage/lead high maintenance staff.  examples from real situations and best practice advice.  resolution tools and advice.  examples brought in from outside the mps, how other organisations manage/lead.  case files from occassions when we have got it wrong, e.g. employment tribunials, and where we have go it right.   explore the areas where outside scrutiny of the organisation has found good practice, e.g. what did the mooris enquiry, hmic, like.
1,8743,1849,8739,And by there lies the problem!!!!!!!!!
1,8744,1844,8654,Remove people from the comfort zone within the training enviroment. Groups inherently form from similar specialist groups ie uniform, traffic, detective, squad etc. These should be identified and the broad experience base should be divided evenly through the group.
1,8745,1875,8740,Sorry about above - I put that in the wrong place.
1,8746,1865,8735,and this is achieved by.......
1,8747,1880,8738,what negative incidents have you experienced that would be worthy of builidng scenarios froim?
1,8748,1857,8742,Variety of teaching methods, especially hands-on, ie group work (not just front loaded)
1,8749,1856,8662,Group to agree what the statement at the top means by quality policing.  Perhaps explore how it can mean different things to different people, but to see that there are some key elements.
1,8750,1851,8716,Roleplay exercises would form a perfect basis for the course this would be a matter that would underscore service policy. The exercise should include a demonstration of something or a situation being done poorly. Attendees would then be asked to comment on what is being done. A scenario could be devised where someone has come up with an alternative way to do something, and they are being knocked back by line management, the group would then be asked for comments and suggestions.
1,8751,1876,8369,In terms of training product, immersive Hydra environment is best I have seen. Using a robust scenario to support this is essential. There can be no better example of how the Met mobilised into action than post 7/7. There has never been such a challenge and the effectiveness of the response and individuals concerned stands like a shining beacon of professional standards and leadership
1,8752,1875,8649,Give me Churchillian envagelism!!
1,8753,1855,8710,We are not asking staff to burden themselves with hours of homework. This is simply recognising learning opportunities in daily tasks and jotting it down.
1,8754,1875,8752,spooling mistoke... I mean evangelism
1,8755,1851,8716,This would be facilitated in small groups or syndicates to ensure that each person has an opportunity to air their views.
1,8756,1857,8748,Variety of teaching methods to suit different learning styles,.
1,8757,1855,8684,There is a danger that by using personal examples we would get bogged down in detail. However, it will make the learning experience real. This will be a difficult - but worthwhile - challenge for the trainers
1,8758,1856,8369,Take people into the affective zone; but provide trainers with the skills to manage and support individuals emotionally. This must be provided during training and must also be offered outside the training environment.
1,8759,1852,8671,Maintain and promote a career/skils  promotion pathway.  By encouraging people with the right skills to stay in and develop into a chosen pathway.  although a ubiquitus officer helps the met as a whole specialists in the role would achieve more results of a hugher quality.
1,8760,1857,8696,Rather than rank / grade specific
1,8761,1859,8371,team working is more achievable when you understand the role of others.,
1,8762,1851,8716,An exercise could be included where the group can create the perfect manager/leader. They would discuss the principles of leadership. Look at examples of good and bad management. How have people been inspired in the past, or examples of how they have been poorly managed.
1,8763,1849,8712,What are they?
1,8764,1839,8369,Input on rewarding and acknowledging good work/performance delivered via a scenario situation. ie some people find it very dificult to receive praise.
1,8765,1855,8682,Experiences worked through in groups to demonstrate how to extract positive learning opportunities and how to sell ideas onto team
1,8766,1858,8734,video of scenaio- promotes teamwork, trust and communication, negotiation and compromise
1,8767,1851,8716,Invite outside successful, motivational speakers. They can act as motivation for the leaders of the future.
1,8768,1876,8369,No greater priority? Policing as a task must be balanced with the individual empowered to deliver policing. We are not in the business of burning out staff and that culture stores up future problems
1,8769,1856,8763,You can say what was said, but you can&#039;t say who said it.  Respect people&#039;s openness in the training environment.
1,8770,1857,8761,Job rotation / attachments to other units within and outside own borough should be encouraged.
1,8771,1852,8668,By using a similar system to the armed forces whereby you develop pride in the force and in your unit i.e. Regimental pride.  this pride in our service in our role and in ourslves then permeates through the Met because leaders are pomoting these values.
1,8772,1857,8761,&#039;Back to the floor&#039; working should be encouraged for higher management.
1,8773,1844,8678,Avoid information overload is what is being said relevant to the task that is expected.
1,8774,1875,8648,Which Blair said that?
1,8775,1860,8370,Team / Trust / Comunicatons skills exercise like the plane crash scenario<br />10 K volts exercise passed upto management board, and feed back from them.<br />Media P/R training to speak to outside the MPS<br />Real life issues bought to the class and seek best practice.<br />Communications skills training to audiences outside the students normal remit.
1,8776,1851,8716,A one-day follow-up course, or a sealed envelope approach where by attendees are reminded of what they discussed, perhaps up to six months later.
1,8777,1840,8738,has the ambassador got the freeo rochee
1,8778,1852,8746,Selecting the non-extreme (either end of the spectrum - i.e. don&#039;t want to be here waste of time to do it this way not that way).<br />Get the ones in the middle and get them to spred the news.  Management to promote and support them AFTER their return to the department.
1,8779,1857,8772,Likewise non managerial staff should be allowed to attend SMT meetings etc as an observing (will provide a better understanding of each other roles)
1,8780,1842,8656,Assassin v Ambassadors
1,8781,1845,8371,Team Work course
1,8782,1859,8371,ensuring that training is available and timely, delivered at time of promotion.  adoption of a flexible programme, suited to part time workers, carer commitments, travelling commitments.
1,8783,1859,8371,courses role specific, challenging them and us ethos of police officers and police staff.
1,8784,1845,8781,Function of MPS is to meet our policing objective. We can&#039;t meet objective if we don&#039;t meet the needs of our team.
1,8785,1852,8746,Minute:<br />Training delivery and leadership - personnel.  Not for the organisation to tell us what we need to do.<br />Personal Hero - different for everyone.<br />Role Model - their discussion - WHY they are a hero for them and discuss commn ground.<br />Introduce concept of leadership<br />Synic: I know nothing about PACE, it&#039;s been all written work.<br />Manage your own expectations.<br />About you as an individual.  Someone your akin too (from history or otherwise)
1,8786,1868,8734,Have you thought about issues around personalties and previous experiences?
1,8787,1868,8786,The trainers have been trained in these situations.
1,8788,1845,8781,Course will: Identify setting standards of the team. Explain how to communicate within the team. 360 degree feedback.
1,8789,1868,8787,How about people who have had traumatic experiences?

1,8796,1845,8781,Will deliver what motivates a team.
1,8797,1868,8793,How about people who are working on a flexible basis?
1,8798,1859,8371,all of this has been done before, uniform and cid think differently and police staff do not know the role of police officers.<br />value to creating a greater appreciation of other persons role.<br />likelihood that borough commanders would seek not to release staff for longer courses and could not appreciate the value.<br />invest a little to get a lot, including attachments.<br />movement from one directorate to another would require either more training.<br />we work in silos and differing roles, that is the reality.
1,8799,1852,8785,Ans:There will be common ground as you will be come aware of what leadership qualities are.
1,8800,1868,8797,The training programme could visit different sites at different times to accommodate all working patterns.

1,8808,1845,8781,Using scenarios for discussion, using the concept of teamwork to teach this training course.
1,8809,1868,8806,We will be using who are experienced in certain situations.
1,8810,1859,8371,this is all lip service and is empire building, it abstracts from core policing.<br />it is going to cost to much.
1,8811,1852,8785,Ans:Leading by example - as a supevisor people will look to you for the answer.  Need to be smart, punctual, disciplined,
1,8812,1859,8371,as long as you understand your own role what does it matter about other peoples roles.
1,8813,1868,8809,Will you be involving the National Crime Facility who are experienced in dealing with disasters?
1,8814,1842,8780,/turn into a whinging session. How will u make sure it doesn&#039;t.<br />The right trainers and by focussing on the positive.<br />How does the trainer manage negative experience?<br />We would encourage negativity in the beginning and then work throughthat to turn the negative around. So the emphasis and learning experience will rely on the negative.  The negative is a benefit.<br />Does the time frame longevity adversely impact on impetuous?<br />Maybe one month would be a more realistic time-frame.  It is more the change to the way of training the invdividual into a positive mindset rather than a long term trianing programme.<br />Haven&#039;t you already learnt the lesson by the time u get to training?<br />No it teaches u other ways of learning the lesson next time.  The intial response is not always the best way.  More a lateral look at the problem.
1,8815,1876,8369,Open and closure by senior officer. Challenge: Isn;t this just lip service Solution: there is nothing in place now where there is no recognition whereas this would be addressed by this.<br />Challenge: Senior officers haven&#039;t the time for this  Solution: Senior officers must acknowledge their responsibilities in relation to this also supported by commissioner.<br />Challenge: You can never get them to attend from my experience.  Solution: This is the whole process of this, addressing the lack of senior officers acknowledging achievements of staff.<br />Challenge: I&#039;m not bothered about anybody attending and don&#039;t need this.<br />Solution: So who would it be important to you for acknowledging recognition.?  That&#039;s who we can endeavour to attend.

1,8818,1845,8781,What if non-manager becomes manager in training scenario?
1,8819,1852,8816,Exfellent idea.<br />I&#039;m in charge that&#039;s what&#039;s goping to happen.
1,8820,1868,8802,Think of the costs if the training isn&#039;t carried out!
1,8821,1868,8813,The scenarios can be anything that is relevant.
1,8822,1852,8816,Adolf Hitler was a good leader, I don&#039;t want to be like him - he got a whole nation to follow him.
1,8823,1859,8371,it has all been done bfore,,,<br />we have got to manage a large organisation, lets try it.<br />if we all work to our potential we can achieve something here.<br />i am too busy to contribute to this, we do not have time for this training.
1,8824,1868,8370,Respect and Support each other?
1,8825,1842,8369,Ambassador v Assassin
1,8826,1851,8716,Cynic/assasin exercise -<br />A=assasin<br />P=positives<br />P - Explained the merits of the course and why it would be successful within the service. Course will be different from those that have gone before. It is original and will work.<br />A - How are you going to ensure attendance is mandatory.<br />P - This would be a condition of them getting promotion both police staff and officers.<br />a - wont they just be there to tick the box, how will you get them involved.<br />p - group work, everyone will be encouraged to get involve, course is dependant on their participation.<br />a - 3-4 days for all staff, outside speakers will cost an awful lot of money outside speakers not aware of the complexities of London policing.<br />p-have to look at the long-term interests of the organisation, would be able to get outside speakers and guests at little or no cost, they will be there to motivate rather than assasinate.
1,8827,1868,8371,THings have been working for 176 years.  Why should we change now?
1,8828,1868,8827,We have combined the courses for police officers and staff.
1,8829,1868,8828,This will never work.
1,8830,1868,8829,It will work because a lot of our problems are the same and we can share experiences.
1,8831,1852,8369,New Group - Build trust by listening and Responsing:<br />Scenario of plane crash.  Various people walk of injured, how do we rescue them.<br />Like the &quot;lost&quot; program - rebuild airplane and fly off.
1,8832,1852,8369,Blikered approach to the role, don&#039;t ge the support.
1,8833,1868,8371,We like working in silos because we all know what we do.
1,8834,1845,8684,Use examples to build on why its positive, why its negative. How to improve this
1,8835,1868,8833,What happens when the specialists leave?
1,8836,1851,8716,p - talked about stages of how to improve interpersonal skills and respect.<br />a-how will this be different from other courses.<br />p-doesnt need to be different.<br />p-team members will be trained to help themselevs. police staff and officers integrated to have a one team approach. Sign posting areas of self development.
1,8837,1859,8369,HAVING PRIDE.<br />many differnt policing skills, when they come together we deliver a quality product.<br />training should be relevant and impactive, hydra is cost effective, relelevant to persons involved, lives in the real world.<br />courses should have gravity, opened by senior managers and closed by senior managers.<br />how are you going to deliver this training to support staff, operation uniform centred training.  excludes police staff.
1,8838,1852,8369,Individual beyond the service, students, other groups get someone to communicate to us from their environment.
1,8839,1852,8369,People don&#039;t come back, we loose people all the time on attachments.
1,8840,1868,8835,They will be replaced by cherry picked specialists who will remain special.
1,8841,1845,8684,Use example to learn from it. Practice techniques to extract learning from experiences.
1,8842,1852,8369,How does that build trust?<br />Communciate with people.<br />What&#039;s their incentive?<br />Because hey are a little stale.
1,8843,1868,8371,You are going to have mobile courses.  If you do this, the quality of the course may be diluted.
1,8844,1845,8841,Line manager to be able to take awareness/different points of view back to use on daily basis.
1,8845,1868,8843,This will allow staff to be trained near where they leave.
1,8846,1852,8842,Is it about perspective, not trust?<br />If you spend 20 years on A wing, you will only treat people in the same way as you are desenitised.
1,8847,1868,8845,If you offer the course nearby, you are not offering the same course to everyone!
1,8848,1845,8841,Could people focus too strongly on negative example? Aim of course is to turn it around!
1,8849,1851,8716,a-how will you involve participants.<br />p-various tools, teambuilding exercises. People could learn about others&#039; past experiences.<br />a-integrated course would be conflict of interest.<br />p-this is a challenge that needs to be worked through for the values.<br />a-how will you invove quieter people.<br />p-leadership from the instructors, valuing people as individuals.<br />a-very ospre<br />p-we have taken some of the better parts of ospre, three person learning scenarios. There have been so many different types of training put together, we are trying to cherry pick best practice.
1,8850,1868,8847,This is the only way that part-timers and others may receive training.
1,8851,1859,8369,hydra training open to all parts of the organisatin, mixes of ranks, roles, staff and police officers.<br />idealistic - lack of resources, time to deliver.<br />this is too important a subject for us not to attempt delivery.<br />not enough accomodation for this training, hiring in is expensive.<br />hydra is very flexible and can be delivered at all points of work.<br />how do yuo get the work done if training is taking up time.<br />training can be flexible and modular.<br />input from all corners of the mps strengthens this training.<br />cost can be minimal.<br />how does the day job get done - deadlines
1,8852,1852,8846,They may alter in a way that they ingender trust within that role - not a new manager perhaps for Insp. or been in role 5 years
1,8853,1845,8841,Demotivating to focus on failure? Course should be used as tool to NOT dwell on failure.
1,8854,1852,8846,Met was you neverspecialised.  So there was no incentive.
1,8855,1859,8369,training in the workplace is intrupted by real work, phone calls etc.
1,8856,1852,8846,Training over a period of time
1,8857,1845,8841,Course will enable line manager to set example to the team by being positive/lead by example.
1,8858,1852,8846,A Program
1,8859,1868,8770,Is that tenure?
1,8860,1859,8369,stop whinging and get on with it!
1,8861,1845,8841,Course will give different ways to see example as positive. Course doesn&#039;t dictate one way as the only way.
1,8862,1852,8846,Not buying in, can&#039;t suffer abstractions,
1,8863,1868,8859,It gives people the opportunity for self-development for job roles outside their current employment.
1,8864,1845,8841,Course goes away from the blame game.
1,8865,1852,8846,Doesn&#039;t seem to be anyone here from the coalface
1,8866,1868,8794,Whoever wrote that must have come from another planet! It&#039;ll never happen...
1,8867,1851,8716,a-what would police staff gain<br />p-feel part of the team rather than feel isolated, enhances status. More understanding of complexities of dynamic of police officer work. Also need to be aware of each others achievements. This helps people to get more involved<br />a-how will you insure attendance and involvement in the course.<br />p- this will be compulsory,long-term benefits to the organisation. And will also promote a change of culture in the service. We must change as an organisation. Support aspect is to prepare people in how to manage, how your achieveing, how do you get there how do you do it. Instead of just bing told to get on with things.
1,8868,1852,8846,Proactive and reactive policing
1,8869,1845,8841,Course will ensure team leaders take responsibility for the successes and failures, and learn from experience. Give a more balanced view (especially with positive and negative examples)
1,8870,1842,8825,What relevance does this have to a pc at 3am in the morning. It&#039;s all a bit of a fluffy approach for police officers?<br />Motivation is the key. We are trying to mimic people who want to be the best and copy it into the met by leadershp principles.<br />How are these leadership principles going to be different from before?<br />Because indidivuals will select a representative mentor, someone who inspired you and u will mimic yourself on that person. The core background that u identify with? These combined core values will be what individuals in the mps will identify with and want to be led by .<br />Haven&#039;t we been trying to do this before?  Identified the characteristics of transformational leaders?  It hasn&#039;t changed since then.<br />Yes but we are talking about natural leaders and developing their skills.<br />There aren&#039;t enough natural leaders so how do we get the numbers?<br />By identifiying the skills and then training other leaders up and refining their identifiable skills.
1,8871,1876,8370,Value of attending course<br />Challenge: Isn&#039;t role play a bit bean baggy<br />Solution: We need your involvement from your experiences from which everyone can learn.<br />Challenge: This isn&#039;t real<br />Solution: Outside facilitators would be utilised to ensure proper learning  outcomes from outside the organisation<br />Challenge: People outside the job don&#039;t know the job so there is no relevance.<br />Solution: These would be dynamic speakers with clearly defined communication skills and leadership skills that can be applied to the job aswell as industry.<br />Challenge:We do not use the people within the job enough. We have people with these skills.<br />Solution: They may form a part of it once we have ensured they have the required skills.<br />Challenge:SMT have been to outside organisations to see the way they manage staff and nothing has changed.<br />Solution: This course is aimed at your front line supervisors and is part of a gradual change process throughout the job.  It is to try to bring out the skills of supervisors to then put into the workplace.<br />Challenge: I am still not convinced that an outside agency would not be effective an it needs to be job focused<br />Solution: Laugh alot
1,8872,1851,8716,a-how do you get smt on board.<br />p-should be an smt champion on each borough so it has ownership.
1,8873,1859,8369,Big picture scenario - individuality can contribute to the bigger picture - op bracknell, familly liaison officers did not understand the process, training days given, much improved performance following 7/7 as they understood their contribution.
1,8874,1875,8370,somtetimes the flowers need to be red and green
1,8875,1852,8846,Now that was inspirational!!!
1,8876,1859,8369,if you bring in the concepts of emotional intelligence into the mps I will stay on beyond 30 years and support the organisation withgreat vigor, inside i am applauding you.
1,8877,1852,8875,I want to work for you!
1,8878,1885,8371,Our learning priorities are based on understanding individuals strengths and areas for development:: how individuals contribute towards the overal effectiveness of the team and how team efficency will determine the extent to which goals are achieved.
1,8879,1885,8878,To achieve these aims the candidate will be presented with scenarios which challenge team dynamics , they will centre around  :<br />Setting standards(leadership principles)<br />Communication(debriefing feedback)<br />managing conflict.<br />personal development(coaching mentoring and training)<br />praising and acknowleding achievement.
1,8880,1885,8878,Methodology<br />Student will form small syndicate groups with a mix of skills .where the scenario will be discussed , options for esolution identified and actions decided upon.<br />Group presentations to the class.<br />Feedback invited .
1,8881,1885,8878,By adopting this methodology the students will not only deal with the interactive scenario.<br />As a syndicate they will embody team working by sharing skills and values and supporting each other.<br />The class as a whole wil also operate as a team through debriefing.<br />The facilitators will summarise learning and reinforce values and service policy as required.

1,8967,1912,8928,What did you do?
1,8968,1931,8965,Most of them
1,8969,1934,8944,Have you tried sleeping with your eyes open
1,8970,1924,8947,Just near the Post Office
1,8971,1913,8947,On the hand, in fact he almost swallowed it.The horse was called Hero. I later found out this was a predictable event !
1,8972,1919,8933,Ther is nothing more important n the scheme of things
1,8973,1913,8958,Does anyone ?
1,8974,1907,8972,Apart from spelling
1,8975,1925,8957,Not for me, its been a great journey&not;
1,8976,1912,8889,Race Rlns Ammndnt Act 2000 promote actively - did  WPS deliver? Who measures success and failure and why?
1,8977,1912,8883,See key mistakes
1,8978,1912,8885,See key mistakes.
1,8979,1925,8892,not sure that it is
1,8980,1926,8890,was the command structure clear?
1,8981,1924,8885,It&#039;s not realistic to expect decision logs to list/discuss/describe all key corporate policies, Race Equality Scheme, etc...
1,8982,1918,8885,Response was an attempt to contextualise the events when hampered by descriptive logs that did not capure the context in anywhere near enough detail
1,8983,1912,8979,Why do you say that, if referring to panel agree that it is age and gender limited.
1,8984,1911,8890,how can you demonstrate that you took these incidents sufficiently seriously
1,8985,1923,8885,no - failure in a particular case does not necessarily indicate a wider failure in this area - eg the successful investigation into the racist assaut on Mr Osmani
1,8986,1926,8890,How does a Chief Officer activey review an investigation
1,8987,1925,8983,thats it, and I realise its an exercise today.
1,8988,1907,8885,What &#039;evidence&#039; exists to demonstrate a manifest failure in promotion of racila equality?
1,8989,1926,8891,Ensure that the strategy is clear and detailed to give direction to others
1,8990,1933,8885,force made adjustments according to the law as required; clearly this was not a strong enough structure when it came to a real crisis
1,8991,1911,8888,When did you strat to consider the victims - all you talk about are the policies
1,8992,1924,8891,Support and supervision to the SIO
1,8993,1923,8890,strategy needs to be more than a bland statement of the obvious that could be applied to any incident
1,8994,1921,8981,Not asked for in log - question is about corporate policy
1,8995,1912,8981,Not realistic? Is equality not a very specific part of the complex context here? Should we not be reflecting the detail of the key corporate elements; a recent letter to Police Review questioned the intellectual and emotional engagement of senior officers in these issues.
1,8996,1921,8991,Don&#039;t you need to have right policies to ensure service to victims?
1,8997,1931,8993,Remember that what&#039;s &#039;obvious&#039; to one isn&#039;t necessarily to others.
1,8998,1907,8891,Be clear about who is actually in charge and where their accountabilty lies.
1,8999,1926,8888,How do you define a breakdown with the family?
1,9000,1922,8993,how much detail should be in it?
1,9001,1916,8891,The importance of detailled logging including all possible scenarios and reasons why scenarios were or were not chosen and who was responsible for the decision.
1,9002,1918,8888,Fully accept that our response to the family was poor, task focus of policy log avoids placing family at heart of the enquiry with a focus on their needs. This position changed after witnessing the family meeting
1,9003,1922,8886,arrest for what?
1,9004,1924,8981,You need the policies, the commitment and the leadership - but there has to be a limit to what the SIO or gold commander can reasonably be expected to document during a critical incident
1,9005,1926,8888,It is necessary to ensure any breakdown in relationships is recorded by Gold with recovery action that is going to take place
1,9006,1922,8891,do not let situations deteriorate to such an extent, build links at all times not just in times of crisis
1,9007,1935,8891,Whoever is in charge needs to demonstrate their consideration of the victim&#039;s point of view early on - not purely relying on the FLOs to establish that rapport.
1,9008,1923,9000,enough detail to give  clear steer to all involved in delivering it - if all it says is for example save life then it is not much help in this regard
1,9009,1911,8892,How can we improve the representation on Police Authorities
1,9010,1933,8888,relationship with the family was not strategically handled - there is nothing in the decison log to acknowledge its importance; consqequently a valuable opportunity to retrieve order was lost as public disorder stemmed from wider community perceptions of how police treated people
1,9011,1912,8979,Is that any police authority or this one, Carolynn answer about national issues of limitations was excellent
1,9012,1926,8892,This is a national issue for a non elective body
1,9013,1916,9004,Are there no standards for logging? If not should they be developed?
1,9014,1915,8892,certainly not in terms of gender
1,9015,1906,8888,The interaction with the family would be documented in the FLO log.
1,9016,1911,8892,Would better representation have prevented this incident
1,9017,1907,8891,A clear understanding of what the logs are for and the importance of language within them.
1,9018,1925,8889,Is one of the mistakes that the supervisors did not spot the significance of the incidents -  Its a lot of responsiblity on the ACPO member to look back wiht 20:20 vision/
1,9019,1906,9010,Agreed.
1,9020,1913,8892,Does the log or the exercise show a real commitment to working with the Police Authority during this serious events ?
1,9021,1922,8888,where does a solicitors responsibilities lie in preserving a relatonship?  Or is a breakdown in their own interest.
1,9022,1918,8892,Police authority make up reflects the position nationally that significantly authorities are institutionally racist being predominantly male, middle aged,middle class and white.
1,9023,1919,8888,why was there no FLO input considered as a prerequisite as part of a wider strategic response
1,9024,1934,9015,FLOs are often the most junior officers on the team - they need a clear strategy to work to
1,9025,1926,9021,Even if that is the case it is still an issue for us to manage
1,9026,1923,9000,the entry under &#039;lessons&#039; about the need to recognise the position of families at strategic level not just leave it to FLO is an example
1,9027,1915,8891,be victim not organisation focussed
1,9028,1924,9013,The standard is surely the ability to stand scrutiny. How we interpret that will vary.
1,9029,1916,9015,Gold command needs to have an overview of the interaction with the family
1,9030,1918,8891,External scutiny and review of the incident from the outset could support the effectiveness of addressing the issue.
1,9031,1907,8888,What the constabulary &#039;think&#039; about the family&#039;s perception is far less important than the reality of the situation for them. if they perceived it was poor or inappropriate then we need to learn from that and endevour to do better.
1,9032,1916,8889,No real relationships with the different communities. Neighbourhood Policing and building relationships with communities is not a form of crisis management!
1,9033,1912,8894,Big lessons good answer by Carolynn about community knowledge, robust management  of critical incidents their potential, appropriate training.
1,9034,1933,8891,force has shown an honest acceptance that mistakes were made and leadership is prepared to work with any organisation to learn the lessons of these mistakes; already see somethings clearly - pay attention to smallest incident; need to invest more time with community and ensure officers and staff are fir for purpose
1,9035,1911,8891,the importance of developing critical thinking throughout the organisation - linking events and taking responsibility
1,9036,1923,8894,Leader can be good at managing a critical incident but if he/she has not been effective at managing day to day issues that create the context in which crit incs happen that is still a failure in leadership
1,9037,1932,8891,Have a clear and focussed FLO Strategy.
1,9038,1919,8885,I&#039;d have to suggest that the organisation failed in its duty and responsibility
1,9039,1918,8891,Taking responsibility for what, the review focus upon logs does not capture context so do you take responsibility for what happened or what is recorded ashaving happened?
1,9040,1907,8891,Take responsibility for your actions - but be clear about what that means for you, the police service and the community.
1,9041,1926,8890,The service needs to be able to respond to the resignation requests in a positive rather than defensive way. What about leadership of the organisation.
1,9042,1911,8888,Do you have the right to continue in your role with this failure for which you are responsible
1,9043,1922,8891,given there is no background asking questions about resigning is probably not helpful.  Questions should concentrate on the matters dealt with
1,9044,1931,9028,For something that is clearly so critical, this is too vague and too much left to an individual to make their own judgements.  We need to proactively seek to improve the way they are constructed and learn lessons from our experiences.
1,9045,1935,8890,Admitting mistakes and committing to rectifying them is a key part of leadership. Resignation of the officer in charge should not always be the first suggestion to be made by any inquiry.
1,9046,1922,8883,riots are more than a police issue and are started by a host of different factors
1,9047,1929,8894,There needs to be a common platform that provides checks of what needs to be done in critical incidents as a minimum
1,9048,1911,8981,decision logs should provide sufficient detail to show your thought processes and what guided them
1,9049,1918,8891,Comments about the processes and structures in place which would enable a clear awareness of what intelligence and radar exist to put issues on the radar and to respond effectively would of helped?
1,9050,1926,8894,A leader needs to identify the critical issues early and intervene with clarity to make a difference to the community, victim/family and the workforce
1,9051,1916,9044,I agree with this. I think there is enough experience to capture best practices.
1,9052,1922,8894,I think this process is not appropriate when we should be listening to Carolyn
1,9053,1932,8886,Despite all the hard work, arrests cannot be made if no offence has been committed. Families may never accept this.
1,9054,1924,8892,A strange decision for a Police Authority panel to use its own unrepresentative composition as a stick to hit the ACC with?
1,9055,1923,9018,oversight is important in knowing whether policy is being implemented and is a management responsibility- the supervisors failings would have to have gone through so many differenet individuals and layers of the organisation that senior people cannot be exempted of responsibility by reference to junior officers&#039; failings
1,9056,1921,9046,Okay, true. But doesn&#039;t this comments typify avoidance and inaability to take responsibility?
1,9057,1926,8889,Lack of early identification of growing unrest in the comunity
1,9058,1922,8887,Action like this needs to be part of everyday business
1,9059,1923,8886,there may be issues about the way the question is presented but this does not mean theat the thrust of it is not legitimate and requires answering
1,9060,1907,8886,It is possible that the force was, and continues to be instiutionally racist. the issue now appears to be, how do we turn this situation around, and how will we be able to demonstrate that we&#039;ve achieved that turn around?
1,9061,1915,8887,See key mistakes - absence of Neighbourhood Police and no real dialogue with the various communities
1,9062,1934,9052,As a good leader we should be capable of multi tasking
1,9063,1917,9034,Current law states that a management failure which leads to, or contributes to, a death can constitute &#039;Corporate Manslaughter&#039;
1,9064,1916,8886,Not making arrests is not a failure when there was a proper investigation
1,9065,1926,9029,How does Gold ensure the SIO is complying with his/her responsibility to the FLO both in terms of investigation and welfare support. Is there a danger of multi tasking and creation of gaps
1,9066,1921,9053,er, minicab driver attacked?
1,9067,1931,9052,I agree. Though might it be because we are of the gender that supposedly can&#039;t do this?
1,9068,1918,9013,The individuality of the leader is often reflected in their style of log, and the rationale of how and why a decision was madeand the contextualisation, so whilst formal training would help, the principles for log keeping will be adopted by the individual to reflect their thought processes
1,9069,1919,8885,The series of events that unfolded should have informed the need for a proactive response. This puts the onus on the police service to ensure its response is appropriate given the reality in Sandford
1,9070,1921,9064,Is this a police viewpoint or community view?
1,9071,1907,8886,Sometimes calling for &#039;arrests&#039; is the least helpful thing to do. the police need to make it clear that they operate within the rule of law and that may mean there is insufficient evidence for arrests, whatever the political and extrnal pressures may be.
1,9072,1926,8889,Mismanagement of the family in the early stages led to heightened tensions at public meeting
1,9073,1924,9051,You can produce guidance - and check lists and &#039;aides-memoire&#039; but if the guidance gets too formulaic, the author will be criticised for it. You need above all to capture your own thinking and weighing up of the issues at the time and in the unique circumstances.
1,9074,1922,9044,Support this but we are getting close to having a decision log being the only thing Gold would be doing, cheking out all policies, writing then all up while Sandford burns
1,9075,1913,9052,There is a danger of not listening enough to each answer while composing your nest comment. However I feel the benefits of he exercise outweigh the risks.
1,9076,1917,8992,This needs to be an active not passive role. Are ACCs sufficiently trained &amp; experienced to to do this effectively
1,9077,1909,9037,This is a job for a senior and experient police officer, if we realy want to do a good job. For the family, it&#039;s sometimes even more important to have good contact with a FLO than the outcome of the investigation.
1,9078,1911,8894,Ownership of the investigation, ownership of the service we provide to victims, setting and delivering service standards, putting in place actions to prevent further incidents of this nature - getting a grip
1,9079,1908,8889,lack of commitment to deliver a good service to individuals and communities.<br />not recognising and understanding difference
1,9080,1929,9002,Senior officers need training or issues to consider when dealing with multi cultural families
1,9081,1921,9067,Which gender is that?
1,9082,1915,8893,Cultural change must be led by the top team
1,9083,1916,8887,The police needs to adopt a strategy of &quot;co-operation by confrontation&quot;. That&#039;s the only way to avoid taking the blame for the absence / failure of other agencies and local government.
1,9084,1919,8885,Yes-I think this is the case and consequently institutionally racist
1,9085,1908,8890,an awareness that the buck stops at the top
1,9086,1920,8887,to genuinely seek their views and listen to community concerns<br />to allocate geographical based officers to various wards within snford
1,9087,1911,8888,Family not seen as important
1,9088,1908,8891,that strategy and tactics need to be linked. head in the strategy/feet in the tactics
1,9089,1907,8883,i have no doubt that the police could have done more to interact with the community and the varying groups within it - but this really is not just about the police, there are very genuine, wider issues to consider also.
1,9090,1918,8883,The lack of scnning systems to id race/hate crime issues means that no connectivity is identified and incidents are dealt with in stand alone fashion, without being put into wider context
1,9091,1921,8889,a keyboard errer in typing?
1,9092,1925,8888,The Police response has a critical component;  to respect the family.  The primary role of the Police is to  investigate the cause of the tragic deaths, if the investigation determines that the deaths were not a criminal act, the Police need to be detached enough to have a fully transparent &quot;exit strategy&quot;   The Coronor will have his/her responsibilities,  other support agencies need to be on board early as its not going to be the core competency of the Police to provide long term support.  Dont want to sound callous but boundaries need to be establihsed as there will be a demand on the scarce resources and its the ACPO desire to optimise the rescource usage.
1,9093,1908,8893,champions at all levels of the organisation.<br />a clear commitment from the top to walk the talk
1,9094,1924,9056,Isn&#039;t there an issue about taking an appropriate level of responsibility - but not allowing others to dump all the accountability at the police&#039;s door.
1,9095,1908,8894,to make decisions and be accountable for them
1,9096,1933,8890,the leadership appears not to recognise the scale of what happened in Sandford, even now; the riot attracted international attention and it&#039;s likely everyone will remember this town as a place of disorder (eg Toxteth, Brixton the incidents alone could not have generated such a reaction; there was a serious loss of grip in the place where it mattered most - the police service whose duty it is to keep the public safe.
1,9097,1922,9087,I do not think that there was any evidence for this assertion
1,9098,1913,9020,All potential ACCs need to conside ow best to involve the Police Authority in organisationally threatening events  as represented by the weekend exercise. They have not been talked about a great deal.
1,9099,1926,9082,The service still has not acheived cultural change - I would question the real commitment of managers to it
1,9100,1908,8891,be careful about using the gold/silver/bronze system. It is not readily transferable out of the public order arena
1,9101,1916,8887,Look at the make-up of IAG
1,9102,1917,8992,Once a Critical Incident is declared ACCs have a resonsibility to consider the suitability of the SIO. Is this a &#039;tick&#039; in a box or a real consideration.  What effect on morale of removal of a SIO
1,9103,1923,9053,why are all the comments under this question about arrests rather than about institutional racism?  Looks like avoidance of the issue - instituational racim is alive and kicking and this needs to be acknoweldged and more importantly understood - eg the lawyer yesterday made the classic mistake of equating institutional racism with the racism of individuals
1,9104,1913,9043,Unfortunately that is how inquiries go.
1,9105,1929,9018,What was the strategic intelligence on linking these issues for presentation to divisional operations
1,9106,1918,8886,Does the emotional response by officers when meeting family members ensure that we are seen as unresponsive and out of touch? ie as we weigh every word before speaking it to ensure we cause no offence.
1,9107,1911,9060,labelling the force in this way may prevent action due to the magnitude of the changes required
1,9108,1907,9100,it may not be perfect, but it does provide some form of strucure to the process. do you have an alternative proposal?
1,9109,1922,9104,accept that but in a real one you should know the history
1,9110,1908,8894,good introduction by ken. shows good emotional intelligence and responsibility
1,9111,1916,8883,Lack of effective co-operation with other responsible agencies and local government
1,9112,1913,9109,If witnesses offer personal responsibility they need to understand th potential consequences. The facts of the events hardly matter.
1,9113,1906,8891,The importance of clear and unambiguous decision logs.
1,9114,1926,8886,How do you deal with the internal implications of an admission of racism. Do staff and the wider community understand the institutionalised racism
1,9115,1923,9100,i think it works - the problem seems to come when you have multiple silvers which muddies the waters between strategy and tatics/implementation potentialy confuses the role of Gold as wellas encouraging silo working at the delivery end
1,9116,1911,8888,Apologising repeatedly does not get over the fact that the force failed - you can apologise too much.
1,9117,1925,8894,Ken&#039;s introduction set the parameters and his opening statement took control of the meeting,
1,9118,1924,8884,A valuable step by Ken - to pre-empt this question and answer it before it gets asked
1,9119,1912,8890,Strong opening statement model of leadership by Ken of apologies, broadly to community and specifically to the family and condolences.
1,9120,1916,9077,Based on my own experiences, I agree with this statement
1,9121,1923,8886,why do we have so much trouble acknowledging institutional racism?  we still need to get over this initial barrier to adressing what we then do about it
1,9122,1935,9114,The majority of the wider community and roots level of staff would not appreciate the difference between racism and institutionalised racism. Hence why many colleagues may have felt sold short by senior officers in admitting to being institutionally racist.
1,9123,1922,8884,Good apology to family and community
1,9124,1918,8886,Not sure that the failings were institutionally racist, i am sure that failures of policy and process, ie call grading/ repeat victimisation/intelligence gaps were due to  poor system and lack of leadership. It was poor for all community  not specific races. I do accept tht such failing could leave  communities feeling the failures were only relevent to them, hence consider themselves disadvantaged
1,9125,1924,9066,... But arrests wer made for this. And for the BIP demo. The lack of arrests is surely referring to the fire. And we never established that the fire was a crime, did we?
1,9126,1926,9070,the drive to make early arrests where there is no evidence just because of community/media pressure lacks integrity. Arrests should occur at the earliest possibility but we must do so lawfully
1,9127,1907,8891,Ken gave a good response to the opening salvo from the panel. His acceptance of what standards should have prevailed was well said and thought out.
1,9128,1911,8886,Institutionally racist is a term we use within the service sometimes without knowing the true meaning or its implications.  Could it be perceived as glib use of complex language to deflect from individual failures
1,9129,1906,8886,We should not use arrests as the measure of success.
2,9130,0,0,Lucy Oldfield
2,9131,0,0,Sue Inwood
1,9132,1926,9103,the lawyer yesterday consistently used exclusionary language - I was not reassured of his commitment to raise the game in this reana. Hierarchy of diversity issues are alive and well
2,9133,0,0,Tracy Sherman
1,9134,1918,9114,What do the officers consider in relation to this implicit criticism when they have been injured etc when doing ther job, do our officers know what institutional racism refere to?
1,9135,1908,8894,how visible was the acc to staff on the front-line during the time these incidents were happening. What support was being offered to staff during this difficult time?
2,9136,0,0,Ron Cuthberson
1,9137,1934,8883,More linkage of preceding events and a beter response to them and better consequence management could have prevented the situation deteriorating as it did
1,9138,1912,8885,Structured response from Sapphire, policies, papers audited and reviewed. An admission of slowness in picking up on community concerns failure to use existing tools.Practical outcome not achieved despite excellent policies and intentions.
1,9139,1929,8981,There is no common platform which provides critical incidents with a check of what needs to be done in a uniform manner.  To undertake what needs to be done was from experience rather than a structured approach
1,9140,1933,8883,admission that police were slow to pick up the tensions, despite having tools in place; no serious thought appears to have been given to ensure this doesn&#039;t happen again
1,9141,1906,8887,There is no incentive for partner agencies to contribute to the intelligence picture.
1,9142,1915,9114,The community has a perception of the quality of service it is receiving. Staff must be made aware that the way that they treat members of the community impacts on that perception. This fact should not affect the morale of staff as it is a truism
1,9143,1924,8890,The answer needs to be converting strategy into something practical that makes a difference
1,9144,1911,8891,Community impact assessment needs to be linked to the on-going evaluation of community feeling/sensing.  Routine activity we could have picked up the signals earlier
1,9145,1907,9115,The use of multiple silvers is more about a lack of understanding of the system. there should ideally only ever be one silver, one gold and as many &#039;functional&#039; bronzes as required. This provides a clarity of leadership and there are ample examples of where it has been successfully utilised.
1,9146,1922,8894,how much can gold assume when setting strategy, will their staff be on line
1,9147,1908,8883,What intelligence was available to assess what policing presence was needed at the vigil. What contingency planning had been put into place to police the vigil? If the policing had been at an appropriate level the riot would not have happened.
1,9148,1918,8893,Agree that systems and processes inhibit our officers from being fully aware, but actually we therefore rely upon individual leaders to cascade that understanding
1,9149,1911,8883,could we have better located the vigil and protected the participants better
1,9150,1922,8890,systems and processes have been driven by public enquiry and scrutiny
1,9151,1931,9099,Think this is fundamentally because we don&#039;t face into the emotional response people have to change.  Current change planning is a classic case in point - as far as I can tell the whole subject is being avoided - there isn&#039;t even an admission that there might be an emotional response that requires management. If we can&#039;t grasp this basic point at that level, how can we expect managers in the service to behave differently.
1,9152,1907,9123,....and it cost nothing
1,9153,1926,9073,We are meant to be leaders - it needs an author with morale courage on the basis ofshared experience
1,9154,1908,9091,What does this meAN?
1,9155,1916,8883,No intelligence led policing
1,9156,1922,8889,Good avoidance on the five mistakes question, one would not want to be hooked on to 5
1,9157,1907,9152,But will it &#039;cost&#039; more in the long run???
1,9158,1911,8884,apology does not always equate to liability -
1,9159,1932,8894,to get grip
1,9160,1923,9124,we do not as far as I know do the research to establish the truth or otherwise of this assertion - has anyone for example analysed recordings from call centres to establish whether there is any identifiable difference in the response to peoplewith different levels of english/different accents?
1,9161,1924,8889,slow response, didn&#039;t hear the community, ineffective response to individual incidents: sounds familiar?
1,9162,1924,8891,Ken&#039;s right to highlight some positives
1,9163,1915,8889,Excellent answer by Ken acknowledging opportunities to improve but balancing these with some good work done by the force
1,9164,1926,8890,Good answer re PPA - need to manage morale and internal relationships
1,9165,1935,9141,Surely the law is an incentive - partnership as expressed in the Crime and Disorder Act?<br />Part of the problem is that other agencies are not held to account in this as the police service.
1,9166,1918,8889,1. Failure of Community Tension analysis at any level.<br />2. No Hate/Race Policy apparent.<br />3 No Repeat Victim policy.<br />4 No link to incident history from same address etc.<br />5 No multi agency meeting to put all race/hate incidents into joint actioning.<br />The result was a total superficiality in managin any incident reported to police at Sandford.
1,9167,1921,9154,we ALL need better cAsE control
1,9168,1908,8891,That the organisation needs to  be much more diverse and include people who can relate to all communities. Not only is the police authority mainly white men but so is the service
1,9169,1912,9018,Goes with the territory, its not a lot, its the lot of ACPO to be ready for these kinds of linkages. Role of sraregic analysts in support of ACPO has not been explored.
1,9170,1933,8889,poor police response to a series of incidents can be seen to have generated the riot but the ACC does not seem to recognise this
1,9171,1923,8889,the most significant mistakes happened before the fire and are policy/leadership failures in not ensuring that WPS were engaged with the community and effectively identifying/acting on significant issues eg rise in racist incidents, right wing activity - general community cohesion isues in which we have a key role
1,9172,1906,8888,The support of the family is crucial to the wider community perception of the police response.
1,9173,1929,9060,Turnover in police forces is about 10% per year and recruitment of police officers is from communities, so it is unfair to make the comment that the force &quot;continues to be institutionally racist&quot; as people are taken from the community and until we as a country treat each other with respect irrespective of race or gender it is unfair to put societies responsibilities on the police.
1,9174,1916,9006,Invest in community relationships in times of &quot;peace&quot;.
1,9175,1911,8888,Ken has put the family at the heart of the investigation - the language he has used will reassure
1,9176,1918,8886,Response by Ken is caring and sensitive in style and seeks to explore his decision making and rationale, overall he gives confidence to the listener.
1,9177,1925,8891,Ken is using very positive language which is constructive, he is bringing his very credible experience to the group and I am really benefitting from this exercise.
1,9178,1919,8889,I think the FLO element could have been spelt out more broadly with action points
1,9179,1923,9173,this comment sounds like institutional racism is equated with individual racism - which is not the case
1,9180,1921,9157,What does this mean?
1,9181,1919,8889,Not sure that I understood some of the answers that came back
1,9182,1923,9122,they have been sold short - but by the failure of too many senior officers to understand institutional racism, to own the issue personally and to communicate the meaning and what we need to do effectively to our people
1,9183,1911,8887,Building the relationships before the critical incident happens
1,9184,1916,9165,So... what did we do to influence this?
1,9185,1921,9125,Okay.
1,9186,1924,9076,Some ACCs in my experience haven&#039;t got a clue. And you don&#039;t need to have necessarily been an SIO yourself to understand the ACPO role - but you do need to get out to Major Incident Rooms and develop an understanding
1,9187,1926,8891,Good to be able to operationalise the critical incident definition
1,9188,1911,9141,There is a desire to do this - untapped potential in thias area
1,9189,1918,8891,The response by Ken is considered and relective and his explanation of Steeples was logical and attempted to contextualise how difficult decision making was made using a structured model.
1,9190,1906,8891,The vulnerabilities of the situation require constant review at each decision.  It would benefit from the use of the 3PLEM model.  Steeples is an inapproriate framework.
1,9191,1921,9126,Have you read the Stephen Lawrence inquiry? Failure to make early arrests without any media pressure at that stage.
1,9192,1922,8891,Steeples model ensures consistency of approach, and that a broad range of matters is covered.  However it should not be applied mechanically
1,9193,1929,9124,We have 43 different ways of dealing with call handling as we do of many other processes in the UK.  We need to have a national platform of standards for managing call handling etc to provide a UK excellence model for policing
1,9194,1935,9099,Officers on the ground do not appreciate being bombarded by computer based taining packages designed to &#039;train&#039; them in these complex issues - everyone inlcuding the public must be prepared to accept that it will take a long time and more than a few quick training courses to change attitudes.
1,9195,1924,9087,I don&#039;t think this is a fair comment. Both groups placed a high value on family liaison
1,9196,1907,8889,1. No real sense of who was in charge, had a grip of the wider, holisitc picture<br />2. a confused and unclear command structure<br />3. poor liaison and linkages with the local communities.<br />4. inability to &#039;horizon-scan&#039; potential problems. poor community intelligence.<br />5. Poor intelligence around the rise of the BIP
1,9197,1921,9018,That&#039;s why its a strategic command.
1,9198,1908,9190,Please explain 3PLEM
1,9199,1926,8889,How do you define success and failure - should we define it or should the community
1,9200,1921,8999,Semantics?
1,9201,1916,9190,Why is this 3PLEM model a better one?
1,9202,1911,8888,It appears that the police only believe its important after there has been a death - not regarded as high risk/importance until then
1,9203,1906,8894,Exert control.
1,9204,1934,9195,Both did verbally and particularly after the family meeting but there are no strategic and or tactical decisions around these issues documented
1,9205,1906,8894,Take ownership when things go wrong.
1,9206,1931,9194,Agreed and it starts with a visible demonstration of changed behaviours at ACPO level.  We will need to be brave.
1,9207,1907,9179,I suspect the issue will be like painting the Forth Bridge, it will need to constantly addressed
1,9208,1918,8890,This answer reflected acceptance of the failures of Sandford Police leadrs, but focussed upon the positive aspects of leadership that flowed from it.<br />Subsequent questioning  sought to place deaths of 2 children as a consequence of police failings.
1,9209,1919,8888,Considering the reality, the perception of the community regarding the police from the asian community, et al-The Police need to accept their failings, short-comings and address more critically the significance and importance of good<br />community relations crucial for effective, fair and proficient policing.<br />Denial or feeble excuses, apologies as opposed to recognising the role played by Institutional Racism is fundamental-particularly were fatalities are a regrettable outcome.
1,9210,1908,8894,Well done Ken. You demonstrated personal responsibility and resiliance!!!
1,9211,1909,9194,Agreed, and we have to focus more on recruitment to the right people with the right values into the service
1,9212,1907,8891,Corporate manslaughter????? If this is a serious connection, i.e. between our failure to act, or protect somone from an offender, then just about every Chief officer in the country could possibly be held to be culpable....... the consequences of this for society is imense
1,9213,1911,8889,Death should not be the factor which initiates a police reaction and exploration of a set of incidents.  Risk assessment needs to be more sensitive and action oreintated - i.e. the risk assessment process is a means to prioritising actions and not justifying inaction.
1,9214,1922,9082,we talk alot about this but do we understand what it means.  Do we know what the culture is?  There are some really good things about &#039;police culture that we should not be changing.
1,9215,1929,9116,If there is continual scrutiny then it is only correct to continually endorse the empathy of apology
1,9216,1908,8894,Leaders responsibility to address the training,skills, resources issues before the event.
1,9217,1911,8883,How did we use intelligence to guide our actions?  Few links to NIM have been seen throughout the incident.
1,9218,1908,8883,Was it declared as a riot or is that a use of the term in a non legal sense
1,9219,1906,8883,No actionable community inteligence.
1,9220,1922,9152,no it will save in the long run
1,9221,1933,8894,ACC has indicated that all the necessary systems were in place; the role of a leader is to ensure the systems are meaningful by providing the vision of how and why they are to be used; to give the people of Sandford an excellent service
1,9222,1911,9152,Cost to whom?
1,9223,1918,9041,I suppose  we each need to know what we are responsible for , and if our personal failings cause the harm suggested, know where our resignation boundary is!. This is more than being the sacrificial lamb to some frequent demander for scalps.
1,9224,1907,9180,By making an &#039;apology&#039; the possible links to a later payout for some people may be raised?
1,9225,1921,9165,Local authorities are.
1,9226,1922,8884,Issues should not be linked, otherwise we will neveer apologise
1,9227,1935,9211,Absolutely agreed. This should not be conveniently forgotten in times of a shortage of officers.
1,9228,1922,8893,Become a learning organisation
1,9229,1918,9123,Took the moral high ground
1,9230,1911,9084,This is more useful than labelling as institutionally racist.
1,9231,1909,8914,I am going to take my learning back home (International) and mix it with our best practices.  It will take me 10 days to recover so its a case of internalising  &amp; processing it.  In the 10 weeks, (which taking in Christmas etc.) I will have brought the learning into my work environment and the people around me will start to see I have changed and that I have an enhanced awareness of the environment I operate in.

1,9248,1907,8910,I will take the learning from this event and utilise it to examine my approach to how i carry out my job.<br />I recognise that organisationally I have become institutionalised in the compliance to oorganisational policy.<br />I understand that  those constraint prevents me from acting as a caring and emotional being, and the behaviours i display around tasks can reinforce the perception  that people are secondary to the process.<br />The organisations processes are for its protection and needs not for the individual, myself or indeed my colleagues. This icludes organisational scapegoating and  blame often aimed at the lower level service officers and rarely placing ownership or blame at command or senior level.

1,9269,1922,8907,Wish he&#039;d told me about the plan to unlock the screen earlier.
1,9270,1919,8896,Associated to me:<br />Remember to always think through to possible consequences of my actions and the consequent actions of others<br />Associated to my team:<br />I work alone so see above<br />Organisation<br />see above
1,9271,1925,9236,monitor progress
1,9272,1925,9264,monitor progress
1,9273,1913,8895,Ask how well critical incidents are understood throughout the organisation and the balance between historical events and future risk scenarios.
1,9274,1924,8908,Organisation<br />10 days, contact SNT team regarding the case for maintaining clarity over their remit<br />10 weeks develop local training for loggists<br />10 months roll out training to key people the loggist training
1,9275,1929,8900,Critical incident development, next stages depends on people like you and intelligence led as opposed to stupidity led policing in 21st century.
1,9276,1934,9130,10 weeks<br />Me - Start in CID where these decisions are more obviously made - most senior officers have a large detective background and those skills are necessary to properly run/investigate critical incidents.<br />Team - Will probably have had experince of being part of another critical inc<br />Organisation - Continue to observe and if appropriate actively participate in senior&#039;s decisions.
1,9277,1935,9136,10 months retire from the Police but still work with JC,BG,JG and the team.<br />New team new ambitions take the learning further and wider.<br />Whatever organisation it is will benefit from this type of learning.
1,9278,1908,8912,10 Months - me<br />Check the time line of progress against the milestones I&#039;d built in at the beginning of the process.<br />Team - As above, but link to PDRs and other key objectives<br />Organisation - Full blown, rolling training programme to be underway and evaluated as to the changes it has produced.
1,9279,1923,8906,10 months<br />me - seek feedback from other experienced colleagues as to whether the above worked<br />team - critically analyise outcomes to see if new processes have made a difference to ways of working<br />organisation - reputational risk - how are we doing? Are we managing community impact and relationship with IAG&#039;s better?
1,9280,1938,9133,10 days:To feedback the positive aspects of this learning to my boss and my team.<br />10 days: to use the new learning in the application form I am currently writing!<br />10 months:To explore strategic thinking through reading.<br />10 months: to implement my learning in a real situation<br />10 weeks: To re-examine my logs and the way I write them.
1,9281,1907,8910,I will in te next ten days, ten weeks and ten months, remain true to this recognition and return to putting people back at the heart of my actions and responsibilties. This will be difficult because people require individual and bespoke attention, which policy and processes do not recognise.<br />I will amend my interaction with SMT, explain my beliefs and values, and make time to actively engage and care about those around me and those I serve.<br />In adopting this approach I believe that people will repond to my openness accept and undersand what i am trying to do and indeed undestand forgive and support me when i make mistakes.<br />In practical terms i will utilise that human /people first approach to inform my need to complete logs in a structures and detailed way clearly recognising the how such can be the context by which My rganisation , my staff and colleagues and myself will be judged when my actions are subject to scrutiny and account.
1,9282,1914,9254,10 months:<br />Me - Hopefully simply reinforce learning that is well embedded in my mindset.  Continue to learn from pubic enquiries by reading reports emanating from same etc<br />Team - Continue to develop our shared proficiency in making fully informed and recorded decisions always supported by clear and rational reasoning.<br />Organisation - Help to protect the organisation and our staff by ensuring that we apply lessons learned from SMOCIT and similar public enquiry, whether real or training scenarios.  Assist colleagues in preparation for attendance at public enquiries where possible.
1,9283,1906,8911,For me:<br />10 days - integrate this learning and my planned next steps into my PDP.<br />10 weeks - spend some time reviewing logs from previous incident. Explore with gold and discuss learning.<br />10 months - use this approach and review effectiveness eg in HR role in anticipation for ETs - use colleagues to review and feedback<br />For my team:<br />10 days - Find out who has done this training or similar and discuss how we might use in BM functional areas.<br />10 weeks - create a plan that explores how the wider business management functions integrate with the organisation and explore how we will learn as a team about how we can best support management of critical incidents<br />10 months - review and evaluate change in relationships with other functional areas<br />For the organisation:<br />10 days - discuss opportunities with mentor<br />10 weeks - explore what we currently do to support FLOs and review what I can do to help.<br />10 months - get involved in the forthcoming review of the way we have handled critical incidents over the past 12 months.
1,9284,1920,8903,Learning fromn next 10 months:<br />Myself: Look at Regional and National platforms that can help provide a national structure to support policing<br />Team: Look to join a regional or national implementation team<br />Organisation: Look to embark on a national team to provide a national set of standards to support UK policing for world class standards
1,9285,1917,8898,10 months<br />me - sustained effecitve action towards key goals.<br />Team- tidier, neater and more focussed- consitent better communication.<br />Organisation<br />Starting to benefit form a more effective ns streamlined service from the group.Betteer communication with the smaller team groups focussed on thier own particulAR areas of expertise.
1,9286,1918,8915,10 weeks for me operational review daily and weekly explore related issues,ask the why:why questions, explore balance of rational and emotional communications; for my teams- share learning points and process,PPA concept and link to communications; my organisation - communications strategy, media relationship management, FLO support<br />10 days - reflect on learning, and what i can do to support a critical incident , for my team - explore opportunities to improve support and get their ideas<br />10 months -for me review Lamming report etc to follow up key points from enquiries and learning, for teams - quality of support provided, better information for organisation increased input from police staff as &#039;fresh eyes&#039; on critical incidents
1,9287,1926,8905,10 months<br />me - ensure that I have retained issues of institutional racism at the forefront of my thinking and professional practice<br />teams - support my SMT in better undersanding the implications of Race Relations Act for what we do<br />organisation - continue to congtribute to the development of the organisational practice around neighbourhood policing which in turn will contribute to better community engagement in preventing and managing
1,9288,1931,8909,Self<br />10 days - Ensure I have the support around me to deal with critical incidents<br />10 Weeks - Shadow four critical incidents<br />10 Months - Ensure I have refreshed my learning<br />Team<br />10 days - Identify skills gaps in the team<br />10 Days - prepare a succession plan<br />10 months - All members of the team trained and able to respond effectively<br />Organisation<br />10 days - Initiate a reveiw of relevant policies to ensure legal compliance<br />10 weeks - Further develop risk management framework to better deliver a customer focused reponse to critical incidents<br />10 months - Review and revise against new learning
1,9289,1909,8914,This exercise is part of SCC which has changed my personal qualities fundementally.  How I approach my world which includes my team and organisation has altered and I believe that  my personal  improvement will be evidenced by my own, team and organisational peformance.

1,9315,2048,9305,Why cant you remember?
1,9316,2041,9305,Are you serious??
1,9317,2046,9313,are these family liaison protocols still in place or were they just on 7/7?
1,9318,2037,9304,How did that work?
1,9319,2034,9303,this did not seem to happen at the start, did it happen later?
1,9320,2039,9312,How did you assess this?
1,9321,2043,9310,Would it have been better for the FLC to be briefed at Hendon brfore deploying to hospitals and casualty teams could have been implemented first
1,9322,2049,9316,deadly
1,9323,2033,9308,This was a very difficult area to control. It is my understanding that the relatives of deceased persons were naturally prioritised. Those persons severely injured were not automatically allocated FLO&#039;s and initially this caused some family distress. Have protocols been put in place to avoid this potential difficulty in the future.
1,9324,2034,9316,yes, the days just flew bye. I don&#039;t see aneed to pat myself on the back.
1,9325,2042,9324,bye? It should be by
1,9326,2034,9306,Was this a clear policy or a made up one?
1,9327,2033,9317,I was somewhat surprised that the hospital did not appear to have any protocols in place for such an incident. The need for clearer hospital control was identified and flagged to the FLA&#039;s
1,9328,2037,9321,In an iseal world yes, but due to urgency, lack of transport etc it seemed the better option at the time

1,9409,2068,9336,what organisations others than the Police have responsibility in this respect
1,9410,2058,9335,to the family of the deceased for their loss
1,9411,2068,9335,why have you apologised
1,9412,2058,9410,the death of the two girls was not as a result of a malicious act
1,9413,2059,9335,to the family of the deceased for the their loss
1,9414,2071,9335,Apologies were intended to be given to the OZDEMIRS and other victims of crime in terms of apparent police shortcomings i.e lack of response.
1,9415,2058,9411,because they have suffered, appology is not an acception of any guilt.
1,9416,2067,9335,Why the apology? Have you presented the authority with a potnetial bill for liability?
1,9417,2071,9411,apparent lack of police response to incidents
1,9418,2067,9335,At what level and to whom have you apologised?
1,9419,2081,9341,use of &#039;if&#039; in opening avoiding the glaring fact that mistakes were made.  Does this force have a denial problem?
1,9420,2070,9416,apology and culpability are not the same thing, and issues for the family MUST be issues for us
1,9421,2072,9335,how do you put a cost on the next riot/ death which could have been prevented by humilti yand acceptance
1,9422,2081,9342,Gx response inadequate
1,9423,2073,9338,I do not.  I initiated a number of internal enquiries of which I await the outcome.  I propose to implement any recomendations
1,9424,2067,9336,This is a joint and community issue. What overall partnership arrangements are in place to share this issue both within and without the organisation?
1,9425,2077,9339,Community Impact Assessments were carried out and reviewed on a frequent basis. Taking particular account of which communities may be affected i.e faith communities, residential communities.<br />Additionally the IAG was engaged at an early stage to ensure the best possible advce was available to the command team locally.
1,9426,2069,9335,How are you intending to avoid such a huge financial cost in the future
1,9427,2068,9338,arrests have been made  - can you clarify
1,9428,2073,9339,I directed that a full intel brief be carried out and engaged the MEG
1,9429,2059,9341,the fact our repeat victimisation policy was found to be wanting in relation to the incidents leading upto the fire
1,9430,2073,9335,To the family for their loss.
1,9431,2070,9338,Given McPerson Report it would be defensive denial in the extreme to say no.  This is not about evidence and beyond all reasonable doubt but perceptions which are also reality
1,9432,2068,9342,Have you changed anything in your style of leadership in light of this situation
1,9433,2067,9337,Riot is by definition a problematic statement. did you appreciate the series of growing events and the slide towards major disorder? How was this gripped?
1,9434,2071,9340,The family felt let down. They felt promises made were not delivered
1,9435,2058,9336,no, there are examples of good community work,i.e. beat manager intervention, positive action relating to conduct of officers whoes performance was not at the highest level
1,9436,2069,9337,Surely you must have known of the racial tension a long time before the vigil leading up to the riot
1,9437,2081,9336,understanding of inst racism not clear, confident or thought through - have force ensured that Stephen Lawrence Inquiry lessons embedded in all processes?
1,9438,2059,9338,Arrests fo three individuals were made for the racist assault on the taxi driver, arrest were made as a result of the public order situation following the vigil, which incidents in particular are you referring to
1,9439,2067,9340,What are the learning points which have emerged? How confident can we as a community be satisfied that we have the appropriate structure in place for the future?
1,9440,2089,9435,who are you consulting with and why?  What &quot;qualifications&quot; do they have in this area?
1,9441,2073,9337,I did not let the situation degenaerate.  I have asked for a full intel brief however events and the activities of a number of trouble makers could not have been predicted.
1,9442,2061,9337,Was the posibility of a riot ever considered in any risk assessment?
1,9443,2061,9340,Are they still being supported by the FLO?
1,9444,2072,9337,after paris etc how are we preparing for potential issues
1,9445,2078,9344,structured de brief and training needs analysis to be undertaken and ensuring that  identified areas for deveolpment are integrated into training
1,9446,2058,9337,the riot was an esculation of events for which there was an arranged policing responce and which effectively dealt with the riot within 4 hours
1,9447,2070,9336,Do we understand the duty to promote racial equality?  IF so how is that manifested inboth policy and action
1,9448,2061,9343,If yes, how do you know?
1,9449,2084,9335,who have you not apologised to and why not?  do you intend to?
1,9450,2089,9436,Was this not mentioned by the Imam?  Also, the press talked about the backlash and there was a bomb threat at the press conference?  Did this not factor a better response?
1,9451,2077,9341,Adherence to repeat victim policy.<br />Need to identify links between incidents at an early stage.<br />To take account of public perception.
1,9452,2067,9343,The police authority composition is a matter for the governance arrangements for the local area etc. I/we cannot comment on this, the issues regarding impinging on operations are a maater of clear policy guidance.
1,9453,2069,9336,Is the uncertainty with the community impact assesment symptomatic of a failure to take the requirements of the Race Relations Act
1,9454,2058,9338,there were arrests and 3 persons charge with incident one the attack upon the taxi driver
1,9455,2059,9436,Yes we accepted there were racial overtones in some of the pre cursor events lading upto the vigil. An appropraite response was put in place to police the vigil, giving due concern to the communities need to grieve. officers were available to respond to the developing public order situation.
1,9456,2073,9340,You clearly did not enagage a member of the community in that cukture to advise.  Why not?
1,9457,2068,9344,how will you determine whether this learning has changed attitudeand culture within the organisation
1,9458,2061,9336,What has your learning told you about the contribution that BME staff casn make to your performance in this area?
1,9459,2067,9344,There are valuable lessons to be learned from this set of incidents and is it your intention to take the issues foward? What level and character of training do you envisage?
1,9460,2070,9342,How did you demonstrate grip
1,9461,2089,9338,Surely you cannot provide a whole answer to this, knowing that comments have been made by a Seargant?  There is a perception that institutional racism exists - would it not be better to hold your hands up and deal with this than to push it under the carpet?
1,9462,2077,9457,Maybe the community should have some say in whether this has made any difference?
1,9463,2057,9341,Carry out effective research into the B I P
1,9464,2059,9442,the possibility of public order was considered, what what couldn&#039;t have been anticipated was the levels of offending by those involved. The intelligence case did not support the outcome.
1,9465,2071,9341,lack of police response - graded response policy being reviewed<br />lack of customer care from control room operator - training analysis being undertaken<br />too little community intelligence at the outset to form an accurate tension indicator
1,9466,2067,9342,Visible leadership is essential to the delivery of any solutions to an issue or problem.  As senior officers we are all trained to recognise and deliver the appropriate structures and action to command and control such incidents.
1,9467,2072,9338,this calls for real soulsearching for each and every officer supported by the force in delivering informaion and training to our staff
1,9468,2059,9456,If you look at our policy log you will see our clear consideration of this issue and the need to support communication between the police and family by an individual with appropriate knowledge of both cultures
1,9469,2069,9339,What exactly were the risks of this incident and what does the document say
1,9470,2070,9343,Established by statute - depends on view of representation versus delegated, adn indeed on plural democracy, and checks and balances
1,9471,2058,9338,the remaks of the detective where his remarks and not those of the police service. It is apparent that the timing of the speach is evidence of the mischievous behaviour of that individual and it should be seen as remarks being made by someone who had clearly come to the end of their time
1,9472,2068,9338,surely you were aware of these views of the Det C. Supt.  Has he been challenged in the past.
1,9473,2089,9343,No - we need more representation here not just of people from BME communitiesbut also those who are active and can support progress.
1,9474,2070,9344,debrief feeding that into policies and training
1,9475,2059,9411,Because the have suffered a tragedy with the loss of two young children. That is not to say that their death was the responsibility of the police.
1,9476,2069,9469,Where is the document
1,9477,2072,9336,how do we check our intel on the make up of our community on a regular basis
1,9478,2089,9458,They can make a huge difference but must not be used just to deal with BME issues, they can provide added value to the force as a whole.
1,9479,2067,9340,The family may feel let down.  This incident was not necessarly a crime and could have been a tragic accident. We endeavoured to make good judgements based upon the individuals and the unique circumstances of their plight. We had to keep an open mind as to the outcomes but recognised that we had not even made a positive ID.
1,9480,2059,9472,These are the comments of one retiring officer not my views nor the views of the force. I find the comments made by the officer personally offensive
1,9481,2067,9339,What is the stength and reactive capability of the local CDRP? Can it reflect positively on these issues?
1,9482,2057,9340,A problem occurred because the family did not directly meet the Senior Investigating officer into the fire incident, which left the family frustrated and feeling that they were not being given all information about the death of their daughter &amp; Niece
1,9483,2067,9336,This is not the case. We gathered together all interested and influencial parties. We reminded all about our service delivery intentions.
1,9484,2068,9341,Have you instigated a structured de brief around the police response to the situation.  How was this de brief managed and what has happened to the outcomes.
1,9485,2059,9450,There was no intelligence to make the bomb threat a serious issue. And there is a misconception that the death of the children was as a result of a firebombing!!! this is not the case, there was no evidence of any malicious ignition leading to the incident.
1,9486,2077,9443,This support should continue as long as is necessary and is usually determined by the SIO.
1,9487,2059,9416,we have apologised for certain issues but not the whole
1,9488,2058,9339,attendance at a public meeting with a view to answerr questions and address public confidence in the police
1,9489,2068,9341,How effective has the Police respponse been to BIP.  How hAS THIS ORGANISATION BEEN ALLOWED TO SETTLE AND DEVELOP IN Sandford.  What has been the ongoing response by Special Branch.  Have security services been involved.  Do you know the leadership  etc etc.
1,9490,2059,9443,Yes and that will continue for as long as is necessary
1,9491,2072,9340,the police service/ criminal justice / partner agencies are not sophisticated in their preparation for community/ family support their is no central point of contact for cultural breifings / on line translated documents etc
1,9492,2067,9338,The issues regarding the retired senior detective as totally unacceptable and are subject to an enquiry. Any arrest are subject to the requirements of evidence and liasion with the CPS. We will pursue what evidence we can and are inviting people to come forward to assist. These are serios issues but we can only work with the co - operation of the public.
1,9493,2075,9340,What ever we did or did not do will not bring the children back. The parents are completely devestated by the loss but our actions or  lack of actions did not in any way lead to the childrens deaths.
1,9494,2077,9482,It is not always practical to meet with the SIO. Bearing in mind the meeting was impromptu, I think that the decision for the Divisional Commander and Head of Crime was entirely appropriate. The alternative would have been to delay the meeting which would have been clearly acceptable.
1,9495,2057,9339,Set up an intelligence cell to collate all intelligence
1,9496,2059,9462,Community intelligence will improve if we learn and change
1,9497,2067,9335,The apology was on a persoanl level and not to any suggestion of collective failure. This was a gesture of common humanity.
1,9498,2061,9337,Was it a failure of risk assessment or a failure of leadership?
1,9499,2070,9339,egaged protocols with Loca Autority.  Slso established multi agency gold group.  Acknowdged and took account of impact on business.  Not only used these to gain understnading of local community but also to understand responsiblity of other agencies
1,9500,2058,9426,by ensuring that all partnership are engage with the community issues, by addressing causes not symtons
1,9501,2089,9485,There may be no evidence, however, does fear in a community not make people scared anyway - facts or no facts?!  Surely, this should have been considered with this - it would only take another threat of sort to cause people to panic and assume that thepolice aren&#039;t taking this seriously, therefore feel backed into a corner and wanting to fight back to protect themselves.
1,9502,2067,9339,How strong is the CDRP? Is it a talking shop or capable of real acion and intenrvention? What is the relatiuonship of the Diviisonal and the local CE under the C and DA?
1,9503,2069,9340,It seemed to take a long time to contact the family in Turkey. Wasn&#039;t this considered to be a priority and is this an example of institutional racism.
1,9504,2067,9343,That is beyond my control and is a atter for elected decison makers.
1,9505,2057,9463,A profile of the BIP was requested at an early stage
1,9506,2059,9426,This is an issue for the community as a whole and all our partners not just a police issue.
1,9507,2083,9488,did you learn anything from this meeting?<br />did you use what you learnt to revise your vigil risk assessment?
1,9508,2067,9338,No we are a pro -active organsation able to develop and reflect on our training and disposition. We will develop from this incident.
1,9509,2068,9480,what efforts have been made to identify whether these views of the Head of crime have resinence within ares of his responsibility
1,9510,2061,9342,How do you assess the effectiveness of your leadership?
1,9511,2083,9339,how have you missed the imam&#039;s warning of violence?  is his risk assessment less valid than yours?
1,9512,2072,9341,our training has to make a diffenece not to cover backsides or blame junior ranks the victim / community hasd to be the fucus
1,9513,2071,9436,At the time of the riot there was little evidence of the community tension over a period of time being evident
1,9514,2067,9342,Were the wider issues subject to abrogation of leadership and structure?
1,9515,2067,9338,No we are not institutionally racist.
1,9516,2075,9341,What do you mean by the &quot;incident&quot;. If the question is the public disorder then the main lesson learned is about getting community intellligence?information about the intent of the BIP
1,9517,2059,9485,There is a need for the police to provide timely and accurate information. we took steps to minimise the impact of misleading information at the public meeting.
1,9518,2077,9477,Need a broad base of community contacts within a range of faith groups to understand the issues and bring forward to the police. We need to make sure there are recognised routes for information.
1,9519,2057,9343,If it is not representative it is a matter for government to ensure that it is representative
1,9520,2061,9466,So how did you do it?
1,9521,2067,9341,Collectively we need to analyse the incidents
1,9522,2070,9491,This might be the case but given the history of immigration in this country how long will it be until we do get the necessary sophistication????
1,9523,2072,9343,is the police authority  proceess sufficiently supported to be an informed and effective body to police the police
1,9524,2059,9418,To the family for  their loss to the wider community for shortcomings where we have identified them
1,9525,2058,9498,it was neither, the policing response was directed towards a sensitive policing response not a heavy handed one therefore there were contingencies to deal with esculation and these dealt with the disorder. The ability to lock down a town is not feasible therefore the policing response was appropriate, proportionate, and proper.
1,9526,2073,9340,Potentially that we do not care/racist/different service to white people
1,9527,2067,9498,Was it both?
1,9528,2081,9342,a key component of leadership is surely the ability to acknowledge shortcomings when they occur
1,9529,2091,9414,When was the decision to make apologies made, and were the intended subjects of the apologies and the reasons for those apologies recorded?
1,9530,2073,9342,Review of incidents with a view to identify learning and better practise.
1,9531,2077,9409,This applies to all public authorities.
1,9532,2067,9338,Make arrests for what? Not certaina this stage whether the fire is a crime or not?
1,9533,2091,9524,Where did you record the shortcomings for which you were making the apologies?
1,9534,2069,9457,Consider market research to be commissioned to discover true nature of learning process.
1,9535,2067,9421,What is the &pound;&pound;&pound;&pound; position of the authority under the Riot Damages Act????
1,9536,2059,9532,The fire is not being treated as a crime the cause of the fire although not known for certain, malicious ignition can be ruled out
1,9537,2057,9337,There was insufficient weight given to the vigil and the local intentions of the B I P
1,9538,2091,9497,Not sure what that means.  Were you personally sorry, but did not feel that any failures were made for which you particularly needed to apologise?
1,9539,2059,9476,The document is available and is clear as regards the intellignce available at that time
1,9540,2057,9498,I think it was both
1,9541,2058,9343,should the police authority be sellected by the local authority or elected directly to the authority?
1,9542,2059,9419,Not at all we are prepared to accept our shortcomings where we have found them and our policy logs support that theme as does the evidence we have given today
1,9543,2077,9436,I think we need to look at new ways of finding out about community tension. Do we have good intellugence links? How do we build these links to make sure we receive and share timely information with our local communities?
1,9544,2058,9343,should all elections be on porpotional representation so that each vote is of equal value?
1,9545,2071,9336,Whilst initial training is given, how do we maintain that knowledge over a period of time?
1,9546,2067,9344,There will be a training intervention.  OK but when will it be completed and tested?
1,9547,2072,9339,how do we prepare for such multi agency crit incident working other than produciing policy
1,9548,2059,9512,there has been no blame of junior ranks, the whole has to be investigated and we learn as an organisation from that. It informs our training and our policy making of the future
1,9549,2075,9338,Arrests were made. The force along with other institutions MAY be institutionally racist. I do not hovever believe that the totally unacceptale comments of a retired officer is evidence of institutional racism. I also do not accept that our treatment of the family was racist.
1,9550,2057,9491,There is a large financial implication in translator services both with the spoken &amp; written word
1,9551,2067,9336,The organisational integrity is at riskj. What reasurrances can be given to immediate service delivery??
1,9552,2059,9546,all our training needs are constantly evaluated as a result of learning. We continue to review and test performance in those areas
1,9553,2059,9544,This is not an issue for the police
1,9554,2077,9537,I think we needed to know more about this local branch of the BIP. What has attracted a rally of 600 people to the area? Does the fact that there are high deprivation levels, high unemployment and a high proportion of young people have anything to do with this? I know this was subject to a request for information.
1,9555,2067,9341,These 5 incidents will be subject of a review. How they are linked and how they could be linked on the evidence available will be analysed and any lessons learned.
1,9556,2058,9460,by undersatanding that incidents can esculate and by early intervention taking ownership and responsibility, but uterlising all the available resourses.
1,9557,2072,9491,this is a mutli national issue and may have mutli national not unilateral solutions . How many traslators do GCHQ and the military employ considering current deployments.
1,9558,2067,9344,How will you bring to &#039;heel&#039; and staff who do not &#039;tow the line&#039;?
1,9559,2067,9339,Are you going to review the issues with the local chief executive? (He is on the panel!!)
1,9560,2073,9344,Training, brieifng internal publications
1,9561,2057,9467,training is of real importance to the Police service especially into new issues. However the perception is that training is not high on the agenda of the force
1,9562,2089,9554,Should this not have been done after the linkages were made in the first six incidents reported?
1,9563,2058,9553,surely all issues that impact on our community are issues for the Police.Perhaps all sections of our communities should have proportional representation within all aspects of local and national government!!
1,9564,2077,9471,I think we can be stronger than mischievous! Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Had the officer still been a serving officer then there would have been a thorough misconduct enquiry.
1,9565,2076,9341,The Police response on the night of the disturbance could have been more robust when the potesters first arrived.
1,9566,2072,9339,what is the organizational memory of the service .how as he new div commander how do I know of previous decisions which I should be aware of and be able to review.
1,9567,2089,9554,Were any police officers present in terms of attending on a personal level?  Was this looked into?  Should this make a difference when investigating the incidents which rollercoasted out of control?
1,9568,2069,9532,If people were arrested unlawfully the confidence of the community would be undermined.
1,9569,2083,9340,where were the family getting their perceptions from - the force, their lawyer, the media, the community?
1,9570,2059,9553,Elections to the police authority are not an issue for the police nor should they be. We are charged with delivering a service without fear or favour
1,9571,2067,9507,The meeting was attrended only by the police? Why? The LA owned the property. Could the Fire and Rescus help with their attendance?
1,9572,2077,9481,Locally I would expect that they have a significant role to play here. They, like the Police, need to be flexible enough to respond dynamically.
1,9573,2073,9341,The mistakes formed a series of events which themselves individuallymay not appear to be wholely significant. However, each specifically had  racial motive or potential motive.  We did however attempt to deal with the incidents by virtue of a review and internal inquiry.
1,9574,2072,9341,failing to plan is planning to fail so did our strategic assessment recognise the race issues and recommend strategic solutions , training/ finance/ communication etc
1,9575,2057,9560,How do you measure how effective this is? Do we just put it in place without any effective means to ensure it has been effectively delivered?
1,9576,2058,9513,there were a number of incidents that clearly showed community tensions, but the policing response to the vigil was proportionate.
1,9577,2067,9340,What about PS Simmons?? Panel to ask a question re this please??
1,9578,2081,9558,this reads like a threat - does the force have underpinning values and behaviours that provide a framework for learning and finding ways to do things better?
1,9579,2069,9344,Do you intend to increase the availability of crtical incident training to other more junior ranks in the Force and of course including the control room.
1,9580,2077,9571,My experience of joint agency public meeting is that there is a more united front presented and the demonstration that this is not only a Police responsibility, but that of the whole community. I think is is really beneficial. (That said it is usually the police who are the focus of attention).
1,9581,2078,9342,significant, and need to ensure that decisions are effectively communicated and that leaders are visible and giving consistent messages
1,9582,2073,9335,A general apologise for the riot taking place to the community would be appropriate but yet not necessarily an admission of guilt.  Any Borough Commander/CC would clearly not wish a riot on their patch regardless of what intel did or did not say.
1,9583,2067,9341,Panel please ask:-  What about the current status of Miss Gaynor? Is it a personal failure?
1,9584,2077,9495,This is fine, but we should be routinely collecting intelligence, not just on crisis. We need to think wider about all the other agencies that are our eyes and ears.
1,9585,2075,9343,A small body can never be totally represntative of a community. It is an ideal that needs to be striven for. Representation should always be kept under review.
1,9586,2073,9343,Yes it is.  Members are elected who represent the community.  They provide and independant and critical eye of police whilst complying with legisation.
1,9587,2067,9342,I am taking all issues forward. We have to react in the immediate term but leadership requires I address all further issues, ie PSU, T and D, etc
1,9588,2091,9441,Actually events leading up to the vigil DO give the violence an air of predictability.  The Rally some days previously and the appearance and ejection of a member of the right-wing organisation the BIP from the public meeting.  This was something that should have appeared on your radar as &quot;reasonably foreseeable&quot; and provided for an effective response placed on standby ina discreet by appropriate distance from the vigil.
1,9589,2067,9336,The vigil disturbances are regretted and shows the absolute determination for many in this community to wreck the high standards we all aspire to.
1,9590,2073,9342,The role of the leader is to lead-make both fast time and slow time decisions based on a rational and documented process, instil confidence in both his/her colleagues and the communtiy
1,9591,2077,9503,There were agreements made with the family to make whatever contact was needed to make sure family in Turkey were sensitively briefed on the circumstances of the tragic deaths. There was no delay. Where is the institutional racism here?
1,9592,2072,9342,for sapphire we can see a change and develpoment of our recording processes and team maagement from day 1 to 2   but I amnot confident we would have the leadership when faced with a sin=milar incident and no clear management structure
1,9593,2061,9341,Are you satisfied that you have an effective proffessional standards regime?
1,9594,2057,9579,This is of vital importance. The initial action/inaction is paramount and a bad decision or no decision to deal with an incident may never be recoverable.  It is vital that Control operaters are trained to recognise major/critical incidents and to insigate the correct response.
1,9595,2077,9569,Does it matter?
1,9596,2067,9340,ON what level is the apolgoy being given? Personal? Private? Collective failure? Admitting total fault?
1,9597,2089,9337,What else was done to respond to the other six incidents?  Were they ever resolved?  All of these still needed investigating and he families supported to deal with their issues?
1,9598,2069,9335,Private apology to the family but also prepared to give fulsome public apology which was meant to  be given at time of public apology
1,9599,2075,9515,How can we ever be that certain or sure - we reflect society.
1,9600,2091,9446,Do you consider that four hours was a reasonable time for a readily-prepared standby force of trained public disorder specialist police officers to bring a total of 60 rioters under control?  Or is it a symptom of inadequate preparation, based on a lack of recognition that such an event was &quot;reasonably foreseeable&quot; given the recent activities of the BIP who used a nearby pub as their meeting place?
1,9601,2083,9341,prioritising police reputation over community protection
1,9602,2071,9529,The decision to apologise was made prior to the public meeting. This decison was not recorded. But unfortunately due to a bomb scare at the meeting the opportunity was lost. Lessons learnt to deliver such messages at the earliest opportunity.
1,9603,2089,9338,Is staff training in need of a serious review - in terms of police resonse and the delivery of service amongst the whole of Sandford Police Force?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,9604,2072,9337,did we make efective use of intelligence processes and resources as a force in recognition of the escalation of incidents
1,9605,2058,9507,it was clear from the meeting that there was some public disquiet about the policing response to the tragic fire.As such this reinforced that the operational plan  needed to be sympthetic and not heavy handed but with the capasity to respond positively and effectively to any esculation.
1,9606,2067,9343,Is it? How are the authority being advised themselves?
1,9607,2083,9338,if a vicar rang warning of violent disorder would you take note?  would you meet with him / her to talk about his concerns asap?
1,9608,2068,9336,the Organisation&#039;s response to the Race Relations Amendment Act  has been widely commended.  All our policies have been reviewd, appropriate training provided.  This response was overseen by a multi agency review group including attendance by Police Authority.
1,9609,2089,9515,This is a very confident remark and I can only hope that this can one day be true!  It&#039;s time to be honest instead of simply being defensive all of the time.  Should we not be working together to eradicate racist staff by acknowledging the problem instead of hoping it will go away?
1,9610,2083,9335,what difference does it make how much all this ened up costing.  two kids are dead well before the riot.  what price on their lives?
1,9611,2058,9584,Community Intelligence was available, the purpose of the Cell is to identify all intelligence and rationalise it for us.
1,9612,2067,9338,Arrest or real probability of conviction?
1,9613,2083,9343,how often do you refresh it?
1,9614,2073,9342,My leadership has reassured both the police and community.
1,9615,2075,9607,We should take note of all community intelligence.
1,9616,2058,9570,are the police not part of the community and does that not allow them a say
1,9617,2081,9344,the comparison between sapphire and emerald logs showed the values of the systems approach (by sapphiree) as against the bullet list (by emerald)
1,9618,2070,9335,what on earth did I apologise for??  Should have prepared a specific response - thought it was clear in my mind but  CRAFT!!!
1,9619,2069,9457,Ensure staff associations are also involved in process.
1,9620,2076,9504,But not beyond influence
1,9621,2083,9343,are the political parties represented on the authority representative of the community - does this creat an inbuilt imbalance?  should you act affirmatively correct this?
1,9622,2057,9574,effective horizon scanning may have made an early idetification of the BIP problem
1,9623,2077,9579,Similiarly our Inspectors are our Bronze Commanders, often first to identify these issues.
1,9624,2089,9443,Are there the resources for continual support?
1,9625,2091,9578,Perhaps the question should read &quot;How will you identify and then deal with those people who disregard the training and continue in their old ways?&quot;
1,9626,2083,9502,do you have a sense that the police are the primary organisation in any (partnership) situation?
1,9627,2084,9528,and to identify them early and react to them to prevent reoccurance
1,9628,2058,9585,how do we then promote diversity is the small bodies are ignored?
1,9629,2076,9544,World Politics shows that proportional representation only leads to stagnation and centre ground politics
1,9630,2073,9344,Consider reassurance and support by introducing personally traiming programmes.
1,9631,2083,9337,where was your sense of customer focus?
1,9632,2059,9456,The apology was for their loss and yes I was personally sorry
1,9633,2083,9336,do you personally really care?
1,9634,2059,9624,Yes
1,9635,2083,9336,are you racist yourself?
1,9636,2075,9343,How are really small minorities represented
1,9637,2076,9338,I think the evidence on this occasion is that the force is institutionaly racist
1,9638,2083,9342,can you follow leaders who do not have pips?
1,9639,2073,9337,The situation became beyond my control following the arrival of actvists.
1,9640,2069,9591,Which family - the family responsible for the deaths or the actual parents
1,9641,2070,9339,what is the community intelligence gathering process and how does that feed into the NIM and our t and C process
1,9642,2089,9423,How many of these are told to the community to help increase public trust and confidence - to show them that you do not tolerate any form of racism within the force?
1,9643,2083,9342,is there deep leadership in your organisation?
1,9644,2091,9537,If there was sufficient weight given to the activities and threats to the community of the BIP (who had a local meeting place and were able to attract six hundred to the rally), why did the risk assessment (if there was one) not identify that a significant number of officers might be required to be on duty for the period of the vigil just in case?  Was the intervention by the BIP not &quot;reasonably foreseeable&quot; and in good numbers?
1,9645,2081,9549,you need to look again at the definition - &#039;seen or detected in processes attitudes and behaviour&#039;

1,9746,2118,9712,what is intelligence then it seems to mean different things to different people
1,9747,2118,9744,now in the system thanks
1,9748,2115,9712,Legistlation that will make collection of intelligence legidimate, like in the UK, should be made available to Agencies cobatting terrorism.  I mean intelligence which can be later on used as evidence in future prosecutions. Intelligence Vs Human Rights
1,9749,2110,9712,Sometimes intelligence is used as tool of presion ;some groups are tolerated in europe even if thy seem to be in connection with terorit activities for their own countries
1,9750,2109,9749,Intelligence is  based on information and information means power. All services owing information are in a superior position in order to assess and evaluate circumstances.
1,9751,2120,9712,in intelligence gathering, is once one is a suspect always remain a suspect?
1,9752,2110,9749,its a way to seek a frank and sincere cooporato and sharng
1,9753,2121,9705,DERIVATIVE INTELLIGENCE. To achieve this you need well established systems of coordination.

1,9757,2107,9712,A distinction exists between evidence and intelligence, much of what has been discussed in debi&#039;s talk was evidence and eeds to be handled differently to intelligence.<br />Much data starts life as intelligence but can also be effectively deployed as evidence at a later stage if properly handled. It has to be converted into legally admissible form.
1,9758,2115,9751,Yes, but not in the real  sence of confirmed suspect until when the crime in question is fully reresolved. In some cases of similar pattern, the suspect could be useful as per the system of modus operandi
1,9759,2109,9705,co-ordination is important amongst all players in order to achieve a common goal
1,9760,2113,9708,Yes we can have standard operations procedure, but we should also be ready to be dynamic because sometimes situation changes during incidents.
1,9761,2109,9714,Human rights must not be violated with the excuse of combatting crime in general.
1,9762,2107,9712,If intelligence handling is properly undertaken from the outset it preserves the opportunity for exploiting that to best effect at a later stage should that option be taken
1,9763,2109,9706,Good leadership is based on  good communication skills and active listening even from subordinates.
1,9764,2109,9713,Legal direction must be sought a priori in order that legal problematic issues can be avoided if case is prosecuted.
1,9765,2119,9709,Recently I came across some of the CIA Intelligence reports from the period of early 1990s. These reports are now de-classified. It is shocking to know that some of the operational intelligence was available but never disseminated due to political compulsions.<br />Debi made a good case of &quot;need to disseminate the intelligence&quot;. Good job done by the speaker.
1,9766,2113,9710,countries must cooperate with others inorder to collect ideas and information to achieve results. If a problem stay in a particular country it is very difficult to be investigated. Terrorism is an international sort of crime that requires international cooperation
1,9767,2115,9715,To prevent terrorism, there is the need for all countries especially those who believe that they are very prone to it, to develop a very virile public diplomacy, to complement whatever efforts that is being made in the field of traditional Diplomacy , so that they can appeal and explain their actions to the ordinary citizens of the suspected terrorists states.
1,9768,2109,9716,Media is a very good instrument for intelligence gathering and collation. Consequently a good relationship with media must be sought everytime.
1,9769,2107,9764,...and it is crucial that the legal direction sought encompasses not only the domestic law of the investigating state but also that of any host state where investigations might be getting conducted in pursuit of an international enquiry.
1,9770,2119,9716,Media should be properly used as a source of information collection. It is well-known fact that media can have access to information that the intelligence agencies never succeed in getting.<br />Media has succeeded in interviewing some of the most-wanted terrorists.
1,9771,2108,9705,planing<br />collaition<br />evaluation
1,9772,2113,9711,There should be one person in control, who will manage the crisis but should be ready to listen to others. The head must analyse the results from the teams
1,9773,2109,9709,Dissemination of information is vital because its no use to own intelligence without further necessary action being taken on it.
1,9774,2114,9712,intelligence should be shared among relative services in order all of them to have the picture of what is going on. Otherwise the objective is not going to be succeded.
2,9775,0,0,Imagination
1,9776,2109,9713,All actions taken by the security agencies must be in conformity with the domestic and international laws.
1,9777,2107,9768,True but can also be very volatile, they want to know about the case but the evidence must be protected from any public airing if there is to be a trial eventually otherwise there will be an immediate challenge to adverse prejudicial pre-trial publicity. In the absence of access to the evidence the media can become very hostile and subscribe to , or worse, generate all manner of alternative theories.
1,9778,2109,9708,Persons drafting/preparing SOP must seek expert assistance especially from other countries which sufferred any major incident.
1,9779,2115,9714,Yes but as far as terorism is concerned, i am of the opinion that suspected terrorists should not have the same rights as normal criminals do.
1,9780,2115,9751,If there is a good intelligence system in operation, he/she remains in the system with all necessary details, such as associates, vehicles used-owned, addresses etc.  you never know when you will need the information again...
1,9781,2104,9713,given the obvious difficulties faced by the officers in the examples given - why were the prosecutors not engaged at the very early stages to ensure compliance with procedures &amp; to ensure correct interpretation of the legal instruments and statutes
1,9782,2104,9709,The lessons identified from the examples given is the impact of sylos in an organisation - what steps have been taken to remedy this defect?
1,9783,2104,9714,Is the suggestion in the last comment that human rights of terrorist suspects should be violated or that they have no rights at all? The comment refers to &quot;same&quot; rights, I am not sure what is meant by that?
1,9784,2104,9766,agree, but international conventions are predicated on the notion of State sovereignty - so the way forward is to have more police-to-police informal contact and when the necessary evidence is found in the foreign state, a request for formal submission of the evidence should be made oytherwise it will be inadmissible in local courts. Would welcome comments on any other informal mechanism that can be discussed
1,9785,2104,9776,absolutely; but international law covers a wide range of areas - mutual legal assistance, extradition, forfeiture, human rights etc - if effective action is to be taken officers &amp; prosecutors must be familiar with all these aspects. It would be extremely helpful if we could indicate the level of experience in dealing with such issues as a failure to appreciate the basic legal framework can lead to failure in court rendering all the efforts of investigation worthless!
1,9786,2104,9709,isn&#039;t one of the basic problems - trust! How do we overcome this?
1,9787,2105,9775,what kind of weapons you expect  they  will use in future?
1,9788,2115,9716,Media, no doubt play a significant role in information dissemination but how do we standardise reportage to avoid media houses seeing events fom parochial angles as is the case now with the western media and the likes of al jazeera and others.
1,9789,2121,9710,one of the lessons learned after 9 / 11 is that agencies should eliminate tensions between them and have cooperation at the forefront of their struggle against terorism
1,9790,2104,9710,there is a blame culture between investigators and prosecutors which must also be addressed
1,9791,2115,9707,The basic proactive efforts to my mind is to investigate the remote and immediate causes of terrorism and address them globally instead of spending billions of dollars trying to investigate acts of terrorism --- i believe that if this is not done, we would only be pursuing shadow when the substance is left untouched.
1,9792,2105,9714,do you think that human rights violations in the world (in general) produced terrorist people
1,9793,2119,9705,There are so many organziations co-ordinating counter terroism initiatives. Who should co-ordinate the co-ordinators?
1,9794,2104,9708,did you identify the body parts of all the hijackers? If so how? If by DNA, from where did you get their actual samples for comparison?
1,9795,2109,9707,Definetley Counter terrorism must be proactive and not reactive. But we must not leave out those countires that suffered any terroristic attacks, these countries are both proactive and reactive.
1,9796,2113,9712,Intelligence gathering should be more serious and efforts should be made to really understand the causes of terorism.
1,9797,2119,9707,Proactive initiatives are generally personal and  requries the courage, mostly finish with the punishment .
1,9798,2111,9707,following the terrorsts attacks that occurred in the last years, one of the problems to be overcome is find a way within the rule of law to improve on investigative techniques
1,9799,2119,9712,the powrful countries think that they have the right to suck the info but not share
1,9800,2121,9707,Being proactive is the best way to combat terrorism. Taking into consideration the huge ammount of money spend on counter terrorism activities i believe that a lot more should be given for research as to why a person would get involved in terroristic activities
1,9801,2107,9756,Undoubtedly, unforunately we all enjoy 20/20 vision in hindsight. Some of the intelligence cues can be so subtle and not capable in reality of being acted upon at the time - even though they are blindingly obvios after we know where they led to after the event.<br />There should have been a system within the aircraft by which such hijacking of an aircraft should have been identified instantly  at the air traffic control and also the FAA and communicated to the different police authorities.
1,9802,2122,9707,in counterterrorism it is better to understand the root cause or motive in order to solve the problem
1,9803,2104,9708,Since some airports did not have CCTVs, how did you identify the hijackers who were not covered by the CCTV?<br />Did you scan the photographs on the passports and preserve the photos of all the passengers, including the jijackers?
1,9804,2120,9707,is it possible that the security guards of the WTC knew of the attack before? Is it true that jews occupants of WTC did not work that day
1,9805,2111,9707,Prevention is better than cure. In order to prevent we, have to know the root causes of terrorism. Advance this hypothesis.
1,9806,2107,9715,Victims:<br />Another topic perhaps worthy of a further heading is dealing with the victims / next of kin. In the absence of appropriate engagement with them there can be the danger of attempting to deal with them on a piecemeal basis and having to respond to inaccurate information which they might have gleaned from the media.
1,9807,2109,9745,Victim must be protected according to domestic law. The victim must have the right to b present during trial and also to submit pleas. On the other hand the accused must have the right for a fair trial. Therefore, the legal system must find the middle way, that of protecting the common good of the society while making justice.<br />With regards witnesses I think that a witness protection programme must be in place at this age and time.
1,9808,2113,9713,Because of the global campaign for human rights, most legislation seeks to protect these rights.There is the need for a revisit of those laws that seems to inhibit diligent investigations
1,9809,2112,9712,liaison between agencies/ avoid bureucracy
1,9810,2109,9710,JITS Joint Investigation teams  must be more frequent especially with regards Terrorism acts.
1,9811,2115,9783,I mean that terrorists target a vast number of innocent people.  Theirs and their relatives&#039; rights are up higher in my list, than those of the terrorists.
1,9812,2119,9746,there should be sincerity in sharing for info.
1,9813,2106,9712,one o fthe key problems facing the fihgt agaist terrorism diverse judicial systems. How can this be addressed?
1,9814,2107,9715,it  is not possible to defeat terrorism without the support of communities. They are the best source of intelligence. This support cannot be built following an attack it needs to be resourced, worked at and nurtured over a protracted period
1,9815,2105,9748,I think that intelligence becomes very importatnt to in countring terrorism
1,9816,2111,9714,The respect that we are bound to show regarding Human Rights during the investigations of Terrosists activities does sometimes ceate a setback.
1,9817,2110,9707,I dont agree with the 9,11 commission about the work of the FBI before ,the probleme is that the terrorist acts have contribuated to create a new wave of thinking in the police and intelligence .now any act is really diged and analyse become vital.Now a small rubery or a small falsififcation can be taken as a simple crime
1,9818,2112,9711,introduction and implementation of a strategic plan
1,9819,2109,9710,More cooperation and coordination between law enforcement agencies both on local and international aspect.
2,9820,0,0,Communities
1,9821,2120,9713,investigation of terrorism incidents should be done as a team and should include prosecutors who would advise on the admissibility of evidence being collected
1,9822,2109,9711,The executive (Police) must also be in the command and control of any operation but with full liasion with other departments and agencies.
1,9823,2113,9714,Despite the campaign for human rights our efforts to gather information about terrorist  we must strive to respect the privacy of our citizens. The efforts must to secure information must be restrcted to the suspects.
1,9824,2108,9706,(2) Command and Control
1,9825,2106,9710,interagency rivallary.
1,9826,2111,9710,I believe that most of the mistakes committed during an investigation of a terrorist act are atributed to tensions created by the event itself and by working with other organisations that one does not normally work with.
1,9827,2105,9706,Good leadership is based on choosing active leader to lead people working in intellgence establishment?
1,9828,2115,9811,To my mind, i believe that the rights of any criminal whether, terrorist or not should be protected because the essence of investigation is not only conviction but prevention and possible way to reorientate all the people that could be interested in the same crime. Terrorists are still entitled to their rightts until the aspect of international law relating  to the rights of an accused are reviewed.
1,9829,2108,9706,Communities
1,9830,2108,9706,(17) Intelligence
1,9831,2113,9716,The media should be more involved positively. They should be objective and truthful in their reporting and avoid being passionate.
1,9832,2112,9775,do not ignore anything
1,9833,2111,9775,We believe that creativity during intelligence gathering and investigations is a very valuable asset.
1,9834,2106,9775,here is aparadigm shift in terrorist crime .hence the agencies need to change from the traditional approach of crime management.

1,9838,2103,9820,parthologist
1,9839,2115,9787,We already saw that any means of public transportation, is seen by terrorists as a weapon.  However the weapon which is easier to target big masses of people is bio-chemical and spreading of viruses.
1,9840,2107,9710,Not just inter agency rivalries but also the existence of those self same tensions which can also exist in the counterpart foreign agencies
1,9841,2122,9820,firefighters
1,9842,2114,9710,when we have to deal with a crisis insidence  only one must give commants. If commants are come from different directions and not from one source problems of communication  will be created
1,9843,2103,9820,suspect
1,9844,2120,9820,communities should always be brought on board during investigations so that they can provide crucial intelligence information
1,9845,2119,9705,the importance of co-ordinattion between the different agencies even between different countries and to gather the results to stop any terrorism action
1,9846,2108,9745,1) Security of victim, accused, witnesses and the investigators.
1,9847,2113,9775,As investigators we should not think that a terrorist act is like a common crime. We should therefore be more diligent and tactical in our imagination both at the proactive and reactive stages of investigations.
1,9848,2106,9820,involvement of communities is essential from the point of intelligence gathering and investigations.attitude is key in this perpective
1,9849,2112,9710,exercise/training with other agencies
1,9850,2120,9709,no information from the public should be ignored
1,9851,2111,9705,Co-ordination is an accepted concept however it has been proven time and time again that it is always lacking.
1,9852,2105,9713,After terriorist attacks are we able to implement emergency laws with out parlement approval ?
1,9853,2115,9745,Emotions should be taken out of the investigation of terrorism so that all involved, the suspect, the victims and the investigators will have enough cover and a conducive atmosphere for the investigation
1,9854,2112,9705,co-ordination between countries
1,9855,2116,9705,we did not know about motive of terrorismin act new youk
1,9856,2118,9820,end of session 1
1,9857,2104,9852,The decision to implement emergency legislation is always vested in Parliament; in particular when a State seeks to derogate from human rights instruments. The ICCPR permits a State to derogate where the existence of the State is threatened. However no emergency powers can permit the derogation of absolute rights.
1,9858,2120,9711,since terrorism toches on security of goverments, how can a detective do a good job without  interference from the politicians. How can a lead investigator be in command?

1,9867,2122,9865,can be anybody
1,9868,2118,9863,This is a model case in which the scene of crime was properly manged to collect evidence. The manual discusses about this important aspect.

1,9871,2114,9860,in all the cases human rights must be respected
1,9872,2115,9864,No. Even if in this case the target was a VIP and not just a public place, doesnt mean that the rules will change.  In this case tensions in communities must have been greater, but it is something that the investigators should take into consideration during the planning process.
1,9873,2118,9863,This case is discussed in the manual and seeing a detailed presentaion from the person who carried out the investigation, helps in understanding the techniques of investigation
1,9874,2104,9871,please clarify
1,9875,2115,9867,Then what are the xteristics?
1,9876,2118,9863,The manual discusses about respect for importance of respect human respects. Kaarthikeyan explained how  a case can be investigated without compromising the human rights
1,9877,2105,9867,I do not agree with you because it is imposible  for me to be as you think as a human being i have family .....friend....... , but the q uestion is: who is the terrorist in general or how we an decide that this man  a terrorist?

1,9882,2111,9860,The issues of Human Rights were kept in the forefront
1,9883,2120,9864,yes, investigations are intensified as more resources are made available.
1,9884,2113,9860,Human rights issue is very important, and it led to the succesful completion. Any violation of these rights will lead to failure in the courts.
1,9885,2110,9864,an assassination is an assassination there is no diference
1,9886,2105,9872,No I think that we can change some rules which can help in this subject.
1,9887,2112,9861,act within the rules
1,9888,2113,9861,We will do the best within the rules and depending on the circumstances.
1,9889,2111,9865,Anybody who ingagges in a terrorist  act. However,one has to look at the various terrosist definitions
1,9890,2109,9859,Political pressure, Public Order in the country, preservation of the scene of crime,collection of all evidence, continuity of evidence collected, secure areas where to interrogate suspects, Intelligence collation and coordination
1,9891,2106,9859,criminal action and political implication existing at the same time
1,9892,2103,9864,no because that is a crime under law
1,9893,2115,9865,It is something that nobody can tell with certainty.  However with a good intelligence system and with a profile on (If there is one) terrorists, try to identify them.
1,9894,2104,9863,This case teaches the techniques which are relevant in a developing country and worth emulating in commonwealth countries. The manual gives two kinds of techniques - traditional and hi-tech. This goes with the traditional method which is still considered relevant.
1,9895,2112,9865,Anyone with any motive at any time any place against any target
1,9896,2105,9885,Sorry to say no because you can do something against the leaders of those terrorist people  with out  rules even?
1,9897,2104,9863,It helps in uderstanding the manual better. A copy of the presentation may be included in the manual.
1,9898,2111,9895,What amount to a terrist act?
1,9899,2115,9893,In the case of 9/11 and the present situation in Iraq and Afghanistan, who is now terrorising who?
1,9900,2111,9895,Hard rules may be flexible
1,9901,2111,9864,Hard rules may be flexible
1,9902,2113,9863,The manual captured the vivid investigative details as narated by one of the investigators.
1,9903,2122,9884,and also erode public confidence
1,9904,2111,9864,no
1,9905,2113,9865,A terrorist is the accused involved in a given incident. Yet it may mean a diffferent thing to many people.
1,9906,2115,9864,Yes it does because all the governments apparatus will be deployed to be able to get to the root of the problem unlike when it happens to a common person.
1,9907,2122,9861,To involve the members of the public
1,9908,2113,9864,No we have to work within the ambit of the law. We may need to be dynamic and extra tactical but cant change the rules.
1,9909,2104,9907,i am interested to know how you might involve members of the public in a productive way
2,9910,0,0,What are the highlights of the two cases presented?
2,9911,0,0,What are you hoping to get out of this conference?
2,9912,0,0,How will you use the knowledge gained today back in your own training program?

1,9929,2114,9912,i will highlight certain principles that I have learnt
1,9930,2105,9912,Analysing the various case studies and how those hit by terrorism were able to get out of the trauma and set in motion anti terrorism action plans.Also develop action plans on how to treat issues relating to terrorism both before and after.
1,9931,2109,9912,By preparing lectures according to the information received during this seminar in order to train other officers
1,9932,2106,9910,case one-paradigm shift in terrorist investigations.<br />case 2 handling of suspect humenly for better results
1,9933,2113,9910,This training is not enough to really take up the mantle of being a trainer in  my country. But nevertheless from the work so far this is important for us from the point of view of the experts that have widened our perspectives of what terrorism is all about from the investigative and prosecutorial point of view
1,9934,2122,9912,To train our fellow officers
1,9935,2112,9910,In the case of 9/11 is the absence of information sharing between the agencies invovled and not being able to forsee the obvious through luck of imagination and resources in analysing of information.  In relation to Ghandi&#039;s assasination, is the good investigation, colection of available evidence, management of community/religious groups tensions and successful prosecution of those responsible.
1,9936,2114,9910,act within the legal powers<br />respect human rights
1,9937,2119,9911,sharing and gaining experiences in internationl counter-terrorism and sharing informations
1,9938,2111,9910,The first case (9/11) showed the impportant of good analytic work on intelligence as it could have prevented the event.<br />The second (Rajiv Gandi) show who an investigation can be conducted and at the same time respect human rights.
1,9939,2120,9910,a detective can get information without subjecting a suspect to torture
1,9940,2113,9910,One of the highlights is evidence of a well organized intelligence system that has given us vital information which can assist us greatly to investigate and prosecute cases that bother on terrorism.
1,9941,2106,9911,get additional knowledge and skills in combating terrorism<br />Benefit from our interpersonal interaction for future cooperation.

1,9944,2119,9912,i&#039;ll develope my way in trainning and i&#039;ll train my team of everything i gained
1,9945,2113,9912,This training is not enough to really take up the mantle of being a trainer in my country. But nevertheless from the work so far this is important for us from the point of view of the experts that have widened our perspectives of what terrorism is all about from the investigative and prosecutorial point of view
1,9946,2120,9910,monitoring and evaluation of information must be within time limits
1,9947,2122,9910,Always expect unexpected
1,9948,2109,9935,To use the skills recevied from the seminer to investigate offences related to terrorism.
1,9949,2105,9910,The danger of not sharing information by security agency&#039;s was the major problem faced by America which affected their preparedness for the attack, while Rajiv Ghandhi&#039;s case showed that its possible to investigate acts of terrorism without turning into a terror.
1,9950,2110,9910,The importance of the sharing the informations
1,9951,2106,9912,Impliment new technics in my job share the acquared knowledge with my colleagues
1,9952,2120,9910,preservation of scenes of crime are of paramount importance in invetigation of terrorism cases
1,9953,2122,9910,Coordination with other Agencies is necessary
1,9954,2103,9912,by planning and training our team
1,9955,2119,9910,the importance of the control of the crimesceine<br />the importance of international coorporation in counter terrorism
1,9956,2120,9911,get a trainer of trainers certificate for my CV
1,9957,2120,9911,better means of obtaining information from a passive suspect of terrorist activities
1,9958,2113,9945,I agree with you entirely
1,9959,2115,9956,Is that all you intend to get out of this conference, i think you need more than that because you may find yourself in a very tight corner and you will be expected to use the knowledge gained from here to help your country that has sent you here.
2,9960,0,0,What systems for computer forensics do you have in you country
2,9961,0,0,What is your experience in the use of computer forensics in the investigation of terrorism
1,9962,2139,9961,There has not been any case of terrorism reported in my country to date,
1,9963,2145,9960,What does it take to train and equip acomuter forensic expert
1,9964,2146,9960,we have an IT unit that deals with any computer forensics
1,9965,2133,9960,No specific computer forensics in my country, like a deticated unit.
1,9966,2133,9961,None
1,9967,2135,9961,Nil. i have not been opportuned to investigate any offence bothering on terrorism.
1,9968,2146,9961,none in terrorism investigation but during other investigations any time we need to examine a computor or CCTV members for the IT unit are called in.  E.G if there is a suspicious that a particular computor had been used to write a threatening anonymous letter the computor is examined by IT personnel
1,9969,2132,9960,intelligence analysis
1,9970,2135,9960,We have a forensic unit, but we have not really utilised the numerous advantages of omputer forensics
1,9971,2134,9961,Each time that we execute a search warrant for a case related to terrorism the computer experts who always participate in the search team  seized all the computers that are found in the premises and examine their data.
1,9972,2131,9960,We have all types of computer  forensic systems as further I know.
1,9973,2131,9961,I have a good experience in the use of computer forensci
2,9974,0,0,Your experience of the abuse of charities
1,9975,2140,9961,The investigators always work with the telephone network operators to avail phone print outs. As to whether this is evidence admissible in court is yet to be tested.
1,9976,2140,9960,this is a new system that developing countries need assistence in.
2,9977,0,0,Your perception of the use of charities
2,9978,0,0,What control mechanisms do you think would work
2,9979,0,0,Do you think that Hawala is a community service or a convienient tool for criminals/terrorists to move money
1,9980,2137,9979,both of them
1,9981,2135,9974,I have not experience it practically, but I have heard from reliable sources that charities have been abused byr recepients
1,9982,2135,9977,I have this sickening feeling that charities are not being used for what it is meant for.
1,9983,2135,9978,Direct funding from the donors to the targets.
1,9984,2131,9979,cuold be used fo both of them
1,9985,2133,9974,None
1,9986,2133,9977,I believe that they are mainly used for other purposes than the ones they claim they serve.
1,9987,2130,9978,Forcing hawalas to register and/or be licensed, and then reporting monthly statements of all transfers to the Government.
1,9988,2133,9978,Speacial Fraud Investigators to be in one unit under the control of UN, in order to monitor all these organisations and intercept &quot;suspicious&quot; fundings when needed.
1,9989,2130,9979,That&#039;s like asking if banks are a community service or a terrorist tool.  It all depends on how the thing is used.
1,9990,2131,9987,I agree with you
1,9991,2131,9988,I do not agree
1,9992,2133,9979,Could be both. Banking systems should be put in place in countries with no such systems, so as to limit Hawala&#039;s activities.
1,9993,2130,9988,This will only subject to scrutiny the hawalas that are honest enough to register and accurately report their activities.  Chances are low that these are the hawalas that are transmitting terrorist funds.
1,9994,2130,9988,Minor quibble-- the UN has shown itself to be spectacularly unsuited for any sort of financial oversight (see, e.g., the Oil-for-Food Program, UN Procurement fraud, etc.).
1,9995,2131,9982,I agree with you 100 percent
1,9996,2131,9980,But it is possible to control
1,9997,2133,9988,Are we again in the &quot;trust&quot; question? If you disagree give an idea and most importantly, BACK IT UP.
1,9998,2131,9974,I do not  trust
1,9999,2145,9979,It is community activity prone to abuse. will always be here with us therefore control it
1,10000,2131,9986,Also I think so
1,10001,2130,9978,how can you effectively improve regulation of charities in countries where NGOs//NPOs are not welcome by governmnent
1,10002,2139,9978,There may not be a clear cut control mechanism, but an aggressive media enligthenment on the evils of terrorism and the likely sources of funds couple with the danger inherent in diverting money meant for charities to terrorism.
1,10003,2146,9996,However, we have just been told that apart from the documentation it is very difficult to prove
1,10004,2139,9979,There is no coin with one end.
1,10005,2139,9977,Mostly used for selfserving purposes.
1,10006,2131,9992,That is true
1,10007,2146,9978,constant monitoring by FIU personnel
1,10008,2139,9974,Get rich quick syndrum
1,10009,2130,9978,should we think about the need for charity regulation at a time of national disasters/war etc when the priority should be to deliver emergency aid
1,10010,2134,9977,create proper mechanisms to ensure that money  are used for the purpose that were collected
1,10011,2140,9974,some charitable organisations deliver arms and amunitions to rebel activitivists
1,10012,2128,9978,Adequate legislation together with an FIU
1,10013,2138,9974,Abuse of charities is there in many countries the important thing is to montor their activities closely if no compliace should not be entertained
1,10014,2134,9974,none
1,10015,2132,9980,both off them
1,10016,2131,10004,I agree with you
1,10017,2146,9974,De-registration.
1,10018,2144,9979,IT WILL BE FOR TERRORIST OR A COMMUNITY SERVICE
1,10019,2140,9978,identify the sender, locate accounts of charitable organisations
1,10020,2145,9974,charities have been major channels of terrorism financing and recruitment in Kenya.The 1998 and 2002 bombing in Nairobi were financed through both Hawala and formal banking services.<br />Therefore there is need to document and monitor closely the activities of charitable organisations.
1,10021,2146,10010,Iagree
1,10022,2138,9977,Their objectives are good but have hidden agenda.
1,10023,2130,9997,Back up: Put this in the hands of local governments rather than the UN.  If cooperation is required, then perhaps the UN could facilitate that, but countries are probably able on their own to contact each other for cooperation.<br />The registry idea is a good one; the quibble was with the implementation.
1,10024,2145,9979,Ilove hawala I hate terrorism they are brothers so what do we do.
1,10025,2140,9978,identify the recepients by taking note of his activities e.g social activities plus associates
1,10026,2146,9978,Should  legally be controlled
1,10027,2118,10024,They are misguided brothers and they need to be brought on line with us. They need to be told about the futility of terrorism.
1,10028,2138,9978,They should declare their objectives before registration and close supervision.
1,10029,2134,9978,special centre to be established for that purpose
1,10030,2138,9979,In fact it serves both purpose taking an example of Somalia.But if it is abolished the majority who are poor are the ones who suffer.
1,10031,2140,9974,most times receipients of charity in under developed countries do not know exactly what the charity is involved in
1,10032,2130,9974,We only hear about the bad charities, so we probably overestimate how many charities are corrupt.<br />That said, it is still true that many charities are abused.
1,10033,2136,9988,account these charities and those who manage them and watching them and suspend there money
1,10034,2131,10032,That is right
1,10035,2136,9979,yes and no
1,10036,2131,10029,Special centre to be established to control charities
1,10037,2118,10034,I entirely agree with you. The work of good charities must be encouraged while controlling the bad ones.
1,10038,2118,9982,I also agree with you.
1,10039,2133,10023,Yes, but: During the previous lecture we were told that despite the fact that a banking system was in place, still hawala was operating and this was due to corrupted officials and politicians.  So my question is, can we trust any government in this fight against terrorism finance?
1,10040,2131,10007,that is okey
1,10041,2131,10024,Be carefull they are not brothers , you can use mobile to call a doctor to help sick man  and somebody can use it to call his patener who is a criminal to commit  crime.
1,10042,2131,10035,So that we can direct  it to help poor people if we try to do that in proper way
1,10043,2131,10010,Also I agree with you.
1,10044,2131,10005,So that we have to do our best to help people or countries need that money and that should be through the goverments
1,10045,2140,9978,intelligence gathering and vetting of such charitable organisations
2,10046,0,0,What training programmes will I be developing?
2,10047,0,0,Who are the students?
2,10048,0,0,What other agencies can I involve in the training?
2,10049,0,0,How can we work together with the other countries represented by this programme?
2,10050,0,0,What support do I need to make this happen?
2,10051,0,0,Is there a need for a trainers accreditation programme and if so what would it look like?
1,10052,2137,10047,every one  concerned
1,10053,2133,10046,there will be training programs on different levels i.e according to the degree of knowledge, experience and post
1,10054,2135,10046,The trainingprogramme will first addressed the needs of the training.<br />We will then use the training manual we received and the experience gathered from the speakers to get out the topics that best suit our needs.
1,10055,2132,10046,the programm will develop surviliance skills,exchanging informtion ,negotiation ,and the use of technological devices.terrorism finance ,charitable ngos.
1,10056,2134,10046,A simple, training programme for Officers and other emergency services personnel attending the scenes of disaster incidents. Further to this to develope the basics for responding to such incidents.  My Police Force is too small for the time to deal with proactive work (intelligence) on terrorism.  However theoretical lectures on proactive work should be delivered.  For this we are much depended on assistance from other countries.  And for this the programe will be including lectures on how should we liaise with other agencies etc.
1,10057,2132,10055,the trainnes will be the police officers from different police agencies.
1,10058,2135,10046,The programme will also addressed the threat of terrorism, identify targets and tools used by terrorists.
1,10059,2132,10047,the trainnes will be the police officers from different police agencies.
1,10060,2139,10046,Multifaceted training programes designed over three phases viz-Basic, Intermediate and Advance using the knowledge gained here and the manual as the reference point. This will give the participants a systematic understanding of the concept. I will also introduce some combat operation trainings to make the participants physically fit at all times .
1,10061,2140,10046,I will first make a needs assessment from the varoius agencies involved in counter terrorism.
1,10062,2135,10046,The training will also target counter terrorist measures
1,10063,2138,10046,Training programme of TOT with the aim of training others to assist in training on counter-terrorism
1,10064,2146,10051,I think that there should be an accreditation for trainers.  At least a trainer should at leas have enough knownledge and experience in the field and must prove that he can communicate that experience to others.
1,10065,2134,10053,I agree on this, if you are referring to decision makers.  But no matter what post someone serves from, the reaction to any terrorist incident must be the same from all Officers, irrespective of post.
1,10066,2137,10046,we wil try to make  all we did in this workshop from the manuel and from the oral explanations as a frame work to our own programs
1,10067,2148,10046,We will try to build a training programme that will cater for the best Human Resources while keeping in mind the knowledge and the past experience of the participants. It will focus mainly on problem solving and teamwork participation. The training programmes will mainly cater for both the investigators and also for the prosecutors.
1,10068,2133,10047,participants from my service, emergency services and any other organisation that may possibly be needed during an incident including members of community and media
1,10069,2132,10048,psd local police  all the security agences
1,10070,2135,10060,You can only train students in combat operations if you are trained in combat skills. What of those participants who are not necessarily skilled in combat manourvers
1,10071,2140,10046,after making the needsa assessment, then i will develope a programme fitting the needs of those groups.
1,10072,2139,10047,It will be an admixture of all security agencies in the country including the customs, immigration and some rescue organisations like the red cross society, some private and Government prosecutors and some relief oriented NGOs.However, police will form the bulk of the participants
1,10073,2148,10047,The students are mainly all personnel engaged with the responsible agencies while making emphasis on the investigators and the prosecutors.
1,10074,2136,10046,this training program will be more effective because i&#039;ll share my information with the students and all of them can add there comments which will help me to understand the way they&#039;re thinking to reach to there minds
1,10075,2132,10049,in thepoliceacademy training   poblic admenctrative for controling and training
1,10076,2145,10046,Basic investigations skills trainning for all police officers which can run for two weeks. This will introduce the npolice officers to the central role they can play in collection of terrorim related intelligence during their normal police duties.<br />Introduce the police officers on the need to preserve and secure any terrorist related incident/scene as they are the first peoplle in to attend before the case investigators take over<br />i
1,10077,2131,10060,Multifaceted training programes designed over three phases viz theoritical, practical and refreshing program using the knowledge gainediin this conference and the manual as the reference point. The participants will be police officers and other agencies ..
1,10078,2139,10048,All international agencies whether global, regional or national with biase for security and world peace. Also some non governmental organisations with bias for  security will also be fully involved.
1,10079,2133,10047,colleaques, medics, fire service, military, civil defence, and any other member of either Government or non Government organisations that may have participation. Awareness of the public and media necessary.
1,10080,2138,10047,Police officers,Economic and financial crime commission officers,Immigration officers,Civil Avion Staff,Nation Agency againest Traffic in Persons,Ant-corruption Commission,Goverment Prosecuters,Civil societies and others
1,10081,2148,10049,A basic draft programme can be initiated while keeping in mind the outcome of this current course. This draft programme can be discussed in a future seminar and subsequently approved or ammended. Consequently all countries adopting these training programme will be bound to send feedback on same programme in order to finalise same in ample time. All participants countries can then adopt same training programme and adjust to their specific needs and exigencies. The most important factor in this programme is that all important and salient points are to be entrencheable.
1,10082,2131,10052,Eevery one concerned and works in countering terrosim
1,10083,2133,10048,colleaques, medics, fire service, military, civil defence, and any other member of either Government or non Government organisations that may have participation. Awareness of the public and media necessary
1,10084,2134,10047,The students at first should be:The Police,  Military, Medical services, Fire services, Local &amp; civil Authorities, Civil defense, civil aviation authorities, ethnic or religious minority group leaders who can have influence over the communities, media.
1,10085,2135,10047,The first set of my students should be the top management . This is because they must realise the need for this training and appreciate the importance. Since they are the ones to inplement, the need for them to have prior knowledge of the significance of the training cannot be over-emphasised. Thereafter we concentrate on the low and middle ranks officers, who are going to be on the field.
1,10086,2137,10048,banches of police linked to the terrorist ,immigration,experts from banks,fire brigade,prosecutors
1,10087,2136,10047,people from differnt agencies cocerned on specfic accedets e.g. police officers from all sections and from rescue organisation and the investigation officers

1,10090,2132,10050,financial and moral support
1,10091,2148,10050,Firstly we need political support/will. Secondly, we need financial and administrative support. Thirdly, logistics are of important nature. Human Resources has also to be identified.
1,10092,2145,10046,Trainning programes focusing on combating financing of terrorism, because my unitwhich is the finanancial intelligence unit has the overall responsipility in this specific aspect.
1,10093,2135,10084,I disagree because charity begins at home. train your constituency first before inter agency trianing. Please sir look at question 4.
1,10094,2140,10046,after developing the programmes, i prepare methods of training
1,10095,2132,10051,the manual is so copmprehensive and full of rich information that we really need in our counteis to develop our training programs
1,10096,2131,10083,Police officers, emergency service, military, civil defence, and any other member of either Government or non Government organisations that may have participation. Awareness of the public in my country
1,10097,2138,10049,To organise Workshops,Seminars and confferences.
1,10098,2146,10046,The training programme that I would develop would include: Case studies; Legal issues; the importance of Planning-coordinating and skillis in the investigation/prsecution; communication skills;the importance of the Media -control and the appointment of a media officer; The importance of the crime scene;  the importance of methodological search procedures; the importance of Intelligence that can result from interviews/witness/phisical and other intelligence scources.  This programme would then be tested on various Top-Table exercises and finally by testing the programme in a real scenario exercise.
1,10099,2134,10049,COMMUNICATION.  Very important to keep in touch with the other countries.  Each incident differs.  Communicate with the other countries to share any problems they ahd and coud not solve, maybe they can get the solution from the others.  If they found a solution we can take it on board and use it.
1,10100,2136,10048,human rights organisation , medics, fire services, local &amp; civil agencies and media
1,10101,2148,10051,In our opinion first we must have a qualified trainer who must be accredited to an institution. Subsequently, this trainer/s will be in a position to train others.
1,10102,2137,10049,sharing informations,even with mutual agreement to share information or to make extraditions
1,10103,2135,10048,Every other security agency that is vital to state and global security.
1,10104,2133,10049,direct and informal contact is a need. Frequent get-together sessions essential.  Exchange of information, ideas and working methods

1,10106,2139,10081,In addition to this, we could invite ourselves as resource persons . This will enable a trainer in country A to have a first hand experience of how the training is being carried on in country B, this will now afford us the opportunity to compare notes and prepare grounds for subsequent meetings and or trainings.( For effectiveness, the commonwealth office should arrange this, otherwise, some countries may not release their personel for this task.)
1,10107,2145,10047,Members of the police,financial institutions and customs.
1,10108,2148,10067,Theory will be delivered during lecture time while mock trials and table top excercises will be an essential element in these programmes.
1,10109,2138,10050,Human and Financial support from commonwealth seccretariat and stakeholders.
1,10110,2131,10046,I will try to develop all aspects of  countering terrorism inmy country

1,10112,2140,10047,police officers, prosecutors, media staff(journalists), banking officials, community leaders, NGO, religous leaders.
1,10113,2134,10050,We need to make our countries decision makers to understand that terrorism is everybody&#039;s problem (global) and not other countries&#039; problems and that terrorism may knock our door without any resoning and notice.  For this reason we need to be prepared at all times.  If we convince them, then the support in financing training programmes will not be major issue. (Money is always an issue)
1,10114,2142,10050,policy makers from phq
1,10115,2135,10049,We can work together through exchange programmes with other countries, through seminars; invitation of trainers.
1,10116,2136,10049,sharing informations,co-ordination , developing co-ordination between different countries and trying to reach to a further steps in this matter
1,10117,2146,10047,Primerirly the students will be the police and the prosecutors, however, members of the Armed Forces, Civil Protection, Medical Officers, Customs Dept, Intelligence Personnel will be include in parts of the course, especially in top-table exercises and in the live exercise.
1,10118,2148,10049,If this particular programme will be approved by the parties involved than it will be easier to work in harmonisation between the involved countries. We are not projecting a rigid programme that is in a water tight compartment, but rather a programme which is embeddied with the basic criterias discussed and agreed upon in such meetings.
1,10119,2133,10050,Back-up from my organisation.   Mutual understanding for such a need between services/organisations
1,10120,2145,10048,Intelligence services, prosecutors ,doctors ,Emergency service providers.,Mediabussiness community like Forensic experts.
1,10121,2135,10050,We need a strong legislative backing, we also need strong financial and logistic support from International Agencies like the commonwealth. We also need political good will from our respective governments.
1,10122,2136,10050,technologycal, finencial,and moral support
1,10123,2139,10113,The commonwealth office should get  all the countries involved in this training to be totally commited to this programme. There should also be adequate funding which should be managed directly by the commonwealth office and a section for implementation and monitoring should be established at all commonwealth offices all over th world.
1,10124,2145,10048,Police customs Banks other financial institutions and prosecution authorities.
1,10125,2142,10047,judicial officers
1,10126,2148,10067,Academic qualifications and field work experience of participants are the paramount importance for the selection of the appropriate candidates for these type of programmes.
1,10127,2135,10051,Yes there is need for trainer&#039;s accreditation, so as to enhance the trainers capability to transform into a professional and experienced trainer and expert in terrorism matters.
1,10128,2138,10051,There is a need.Meanwhile there should be accreditation by the commonwealth secretariat.
1,10129,2140,10048,Ministry of finance officials,  Ministry of justice officials, intelligency arms , immigration.
1,10130,2143,10046,the program is so beneficial as it will develop the capability of police officers in combatting terrorism ,as no country could claim to be safe from the effect of this dangerous acts.
1,10131,2139,10051,There is the need for accreditation and certification of trainers . Then, the trainers should now be put in the database for efficient utilisation.There should also be refreshing courses may be yearly or quarterly.
1,10132,2137,10051,training must be evolutif and subject to more adaptations
1,10133,2143,10047,the training program will be submitted to police officers and agences working in ploice security and information<br />exchanging information ,experise ,conducting seminars and workshops<br />qualifying police officers in this domain by enrolling them in such conferences,that supervised by the commonwealth.<br />the present manual is so effective and rich of the material needed for p[oice officers.
1,10134,2144,10046,THE TRAINING PROGRAMME FOR OFFICERS AND OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES ABOUT TERRORISM
1,10135,2145,10049,Personal contact through the network created in this workshop.<br />FIU email  ( Egmond)<br />Through interpol.<br />commonwealth secretariat.
1,10136,2133,10051,There is always a need for this as it will enable the delivery of quality training  and will be the motivation for better performance, a fact that will contribute to the best results and in achieving higher standards
1,10137,2131,10097,I agree with you
1,10138,2135,10051,Trainers accreditation is very necessary, otherwise some countries will not utilised the participants on return. But if they are accredited by the commonwealth with a caveat that these are the recognised experts then we are on our way to finding a solution to terrorism.
1,10139,2136,10051,i think we need to issue a manual like the one we have here and that we&#039;ll be enough
1,10140,2137,10050,network of communications and to provide moden technics to provide trainings
1,10141,2140,10050,Political will for purposes of making finances avialable
1,10142,2131,10115,We can work together through exchange information, programmes with other countries, through seminars; invitation of trainers.
1,10143,2134,10093,Thank you for the correction.  I agree that the Police should get the training first.  Very wrongly put by me.  Didnt see Q 4.  I don&#039;t understand your comment on charity.
1,10144,2146,10048,The army; Civil protection personnel, Para Medics, Customs officials and members from the security services.
1,10145,2140,10050,More skilled trainers
1,10146,2148,10048,The training programmes must be prepared according to the xigencies of the agency involved. While keeping in mind that all agencies are complimentary to each other all of them have different rights and obilgations which differ from each other. The common goal is one that brings all agencies under one roof. So the training programme must be one that caters for the different aspects of the personnel involved.
1,10147,2131,10090,Financial and moral support are necessary for that goale
1,10148,2135,10051,Commonwealth accreditation is very important so that the trainers will work without intimidation from renegades regimes. Inotherwords the trainers/experts should work in their respective countries with full unqualified international support and backing
1,10149,2146,10049,On police to police bases - .  E.g. Email and evern through Interpol.<br />Throught the Intellignece services the various countries
1,10150,2145,10050,Trainning modules and materials from commonwealth secretariat like Computer data etc.<br />Finances<br />Interagency cooperation<br />I need more advanced trainning to be able to articulate these issues competently
1,10151,2131,10090,I agree with you.
1,10152,2138,10050,Training facilities/aids like computers,laptops,projectors which are difficult to acquire.
1,10153,2131,10122,Thats right
1,10154,2131,10140,this very important to counter teerorism
1,10155,2134,10051,IYes there is a need and i am of the opinion that refresher seminars should be taking place, where we can discuss any issues affecting training.
1,10156,2135,10051,Trainers acreditation should be a top priority, and the commonwealth if it is sincere should provide an initial support programme that should go directly to a special fund that can be utilised by the trainers without interfereance from the respectives superior commands and/or governments.
1,10157,2140,10050,Commonwealth sectretariate, United States Goverment, plus expersts from other neighbouring countries.
1,10158,2144,10047,OFFICERS ---ARMY--DIFFERNT AGENCIES  -CIVIL DEFENSE --
1,10159,2131,10101,I think that we shuold have a qualified trainer who must be accredited to an institution. Subsequently, this trainer/s will be in a position to train others.
1,10160,2146,10050,First I would need to convince my superiors to support such programme becuase the programme would involve financial contributions for equipment such as IT and it would involve the committement of personnel for training. It would also require the right environment where the programme is to be carried out.
1,10161,2145,10051,I expect acertificate at the end of this course.<br />The commonwealth secretariat to monitor ,regulate ,moderate the trainning programes and provide accreditation<br />Accreditation in neccessary.
1,10162,2139,10070,There is no hard and fast rule on how to utilise the training manuals, the training need of your country will dictate the tempo of your training and you can get all those qualified in combat training to help you out if there is any need. , you may include local flavour to suit your circumstances. You will need to give general training to all but specific roles assigned will dictate the type of further training they will require.It will be share waste of time teaching a fire brigade what watermarks are, likewise, a soldier and uniform poicemen will benefit immensely from combat training if there is the need for them to follow the terrorists to their dens.
1,10163,2131,10133,that is okey
1,10164,2148,10047,Apart from training the responsible agencies involved, we are of the opinion that basic training should be initiated at the early stage of schooldays in order that our children will be aware of the present and future problems if known. A better educated society will result in a better life, and an informed person is in a supreme position to decide on certains apects.
1,10165,2133,10065,The meaning was that each officer/person must receive training relevant to his duties/post. Not everyone will be decision maker but there will be a variety of duties.
1,10166,2145,10046,i dont think we have received sufficient trainning to set our own trainning programes. We need more indepth trainning first
1,10167,2131,10102,We can work together by sharing informations,even with mutual agreement to share information or to make extraditions
1,10168,2139,10085,I think the training should be a mixture of both the high, middle and the low categories of officers to avoid planting on the stone or drawing water with a basket.
1,10169,2131,10116,sharing informations,co-ordination , developing co-ordination between different countries and trying to reach to a further steps in this matter

1,10183,2154,10171,discussed and formulated a tactical time critical plan with a silver commander
1,10184,2160,10171,Reffered senior commanders to remain within appropriate role
1,10185,2176,10171,The use of community interlocutors before, during and after the disorder, underpinned by use of arbitrators and negotiators behind the scenes. Also the use of community to get out a powerful police message condemning violence.
1,10186,2173,10171,pulled together the resources that were to investigate three strands of the operation - the two murders and the post disorder investigation
1,10187,2181,10171,In designating terretorial areas for bronze Commanders, I employed another Bronze Commander with free licence to address the most challenging disorder sites.
1,10188,2182,10171,Established a structured an intelligence cell
1,10189,2174,10171,With my staff developed a new tactical option to deal with the firearms threat to Police Support Units

1,10193,2180,10171,I realised that Birmingham City Council needed to have invovlvment at a Startegic level - they just did not appear to be engaged/sighted during the build up to the weekend of 21/22 and briefed the cabinet seeking their enaggement
1,10194,2185,10176,how was this demonstrated
1,10195,2185,10194,by working from home that day
1,10196,2185,10176,another one
1,10197,2171,10178,How did you do this
1,10198,2175,10182,How was this done?
1,10199,2172,10182,What specific was outside the box?
1,10200,2154,10173,excellent idea
1,10201,2177,10182,what did that look like then?
1,10202,2170,10173,This was very helpful
1,10203,2158,10172,Please give an example
1,10204,2176,10174,This was vital, and really helped mitigate the problems on the ground.
1,10205,2159,10188,Is there not or was there not one in place at force level originally
1,10206,2173,10190,how was this achieved
1,10207,2161,10173,Equipping Silver Control with large enough and usable area maps - did it happen early enough
1,10208,2180,10189,This was exeptionally good work completed in very short timescales
1,10209,2167,10194,Not being blinkered to the various manual/protcols but reflecting on coninually changing circunstances.
1,10210,2153,10188,How was this different from previous incidents
1,10211,2182,10178,In what way and how defensible was this
1,10212,2176,10193,Pity they still hid, despite WMP best efforts.
1,10213,2174,10188,Will this model inform future intel support to Gold?
1,10214,2160,10182,How did you go out of he box?Officers were disappointed ith some of he welfare arrangements during the early stages of this incident
1,10215,2181,10177,The focus on events described by AO1 potentially skewed deployment of resources. e.g &quot;they are attempting to set fire to a petrol station&quot; - there was more serious disorder taking place but because of what was being described, there was a tension that it should have primacy. This was exacerbated by the fact that there was no download link for me to view what was being described and make my own judgement of events.
1,10216,2169,10172,a number of dynamic decisions were made by lots of people not in command but saved time and effort
1,10217,2165,10188,where was the intelligence comming from, police, pubic,informants etc?
1,10218,2183,10188,Did this intelligence cell support the and feed into the Force Intelligence provision and was it sighted on the force intelligence requirements

1,10237,2159,10231,Too many bronzes with overlapping territorial responsibilities, causing conflict and poor responses
1,10238,2161,10222,Learn the communication links between Force Control Centre (FCC), Gold control, Silver Control and OCU Controls.
1,10239,2176,10220,Generally brilliant by wmp/ocu, with caveat thet the &#039;usual suspect&#039; community reps we&#039;d relied on disappeared and we hab to find ad-hoc folk at the last moment.
1,10240,2177,10224,We should have had a better plan for firearms incidents at the start of the operation. The plan we came up with later was good, but the public order officers haven&#039;t been trained on it.
1,10241,2172,10225,The &#039;taking head&#039; introduction from DCC Sims was highly regarded by everyone, seen as setting the style for the tour of duty and contained useful messages
1,10242,2174,10224,The Force should recognise the reality that wih inner city public disorder - criminal firearms will be a threat - police need to have equipment &amp; tactics to meet this threat.
1,10243,2181,10224,Public Disorder remit of Silver, Firearms remit of Gold. There was a need to re-assess how  we address firearms in disorder scenarios.
1,10244,2167,10221,Personal Protective Equipment:- fit for purpose.
1,10245,2169,10233,who was doing my role while i was engaged in op? There was an increase in normal business in the department at the same time as officers were working long hours with no time off on op.

1,10247,2175,10220,Were they really of any use? Certain young black and asian people were after a fight and they got one. Was there anything we could have done to stop it?
1,10248,2180,10220,Many of the &quot;community leaders&quot; failed to show courage in challenging the rape story. Why was this-how can we ensure this couldn&#039;t happen again?
1,10249,2182,10227,Personal / professional agendas of different Gold commanders gave rise to confusion regarding consistency around what the policing priorities / style was.
1,10250,2161,10220,Has the organisation identified the most approporiate interlocutors to have impact and make a difference in the community
1,10251,2153,10221,Need to consider other staff other than police officers re welfare issues eg. refreshments
1,10252,2159,10221,Officers spent excessive periods either on deployment or on standby in &#039;uniform&#039; not condusive to meet welfare needs.

1,10255,2171,10221,On the weekend of the disorder many officers were retained on duty with few if any opportunities to take refreshments or to obtain food. Central provision of food and refreshments was particularly poor. No central coordination.

2,10257,0,0,Contingency Planning
1,10258,2161,10220,Understanding the wide spectrom of interlocutors required
1,10259,2177,10225,The briefing we did for officers didn&#039;t on the night of the 22nd didn&#039;t change as the disorder grew. Officers were deployed with limited intel/briefing
1,10260,2176,10227,F3 management coped well with the impossible task; they had to police the situation after the riot.
1,10261,2157,10224,firearms were seen on numerous occasions &amp; then the officer was shot. Attempts still made to deploy officers to incidents without appropriate support.
1,10262,2166,10222,F3 OCU putting too much emphasis on community policing when disorder already taking place. Their influence on strategy far too strong considering they were acting outside of the command structure
1,10263,2153,10232,How can we improve
1,10264,2175,10221,Insufficient rads were put on duty to cover from 7pm to 7am. Too much stress for two people.
1,10265,2161,10220,Understanding the significant impact of mediation in all its forms
1,10266,2170,10220,In overt and covert ways thiswas useful - Did it exercise too much influence over critical decision making ?
1,10267,2154,10229,p.o equipment, x1 piece suits were uncomfortable when other officers were in better x2 piece suits....supplies unit not reacting quicker to test and purchase more suitable items despite it being raised in force for at least the last 2 years
1,10268,2169,10224,there was the need to ensure that a psu went with firerms as per manual, yet this was not easy to communicate between
1,10269,2159,10223,The overuse of reflective tabards that are not fire resistant when there was a fire risk.
1,10270,2158,10226,no structured format - or records of what occured -
1,10271,2172,10227,It became clear early on that there were great benifits from using the same staff as much as possible, particularly thoses engaged in gold silver roles. This allowed for continuity of style and decision making...not always possible.
1,10272,2177,10222,Gold did not have a clear picture of silvers needs, held on to reserve too long
1,10273,2174,10257,Lack of a formal cadre system for trained/accredited public order commanders hindered the operation.
1,10274,2180,10223,We probably miscalculated how the post demonstattion service at Derek Webleys church maybe perecived within the Asian community
1,10275,2171,10221,Mny officers were sent home with little if any consideration of their welfare and diffusing/counselling was not considered.
1,10276,2160,10231,The command structure was at time vulnerable from officers acting outside of their respective roles.  Additional commanders were on he ground, which may have created confusion.  Officers raised actions without the knowledge of the overall duty gold commander, and finally commanders were called into meetings and kept away from their place of duty for long periods of time leaving the pivotal role of silver commander unattended.
1,10277,2155,10221,Long periods when comfort breaks could not be taken which necessitated using side alleyways.
1,10278,2175,10222,Not good enough on occassions. F3 didn&#039;t know an officer had been shot for quite a while after it happened.
1,10279,2161,10227,The requirment to step up the style of policing to a higher level of enforcment from the policing th demonstration to policing the early disorder
1,10280,2181,10222,Gold&#039;s strategy as communicated to Silver as not achieveable. e.g protect fixed sites of vulnerability - insufficient resources whilst responding to disorder and strategy of seeking to keep hostiles on the move rather than providing police officers as targets.
1,10281,2170,10225,The location was a bit remote and delays in getting people on the gound quickly meant that officers were held on duty for too long on some occasions
1,10282,2177,10226,We don&#039;t seem to place enough emphasis on debriefing, or capture learning from it.
1,10283,2159,10223,officers being deployed to hostile areas not properly &#039;clothed&#039; and having to dress in middle of &#039;riot&#039; situation.
1,10284,2176,10253,There were definite issues re the organisation&#039; s 999 capacity and the capacity to switch messages due to paucity of terminals in ocus, silvers, etc. This impinged in operational knowledge and realtime effectiveness.
1,10285,2166,10254,The level of training was sufficient for officer facing conventional threat. However, the use of firearms overtly within disorder identified a gap in skills.
1,10286,2171,10231,When bronzes were requesting decisions from silver there were considerable delays leading to frustration.
1,10287,2182,10220,There was a tangible absence of leadership with regard to community engagement by Local Authority and local councillors
1,10288,2161,10223,Differing assessment from community intelligence to that being received from mediators. How were these combined in an overall assessment
1,10289,2169,10221,there were a number of people who required feeding the force has not the facilities to do this, a system was put in place and worked well, but there were complaint and officers should be made aware that they need to look after themselves and not rely on the force to do everything for them this was for real not a game
1,10290,2159,10224,Why were specialist resources kept in reserve for so long
1,10291,2167,10231,Rigid adherence to tactical plan prevented flexability by Bronze Commanders to adapt to changing circumstances without attempting to gain consent of Silver &amp; Gold utilising poor communication channels.
1,10292,2173,10230,I question the quality of the evidence gathering during and prior to the disorders. Where the EGT briefed if so what was the briefing. Some of the video footage is good while other footage is unclear and does not appear to be directed.<br />Some real problems around recovering evidence from people deployed during the events. Post incident hot debriefing anther issue.<br />Staff not knowing if their &#039;information&#039; would be of use not only in the post incident investigation but of value within the other major murder and attempt murder investigations.
1,10293,2181,10229,Support for officers e.g defusing post officer shot was requested - I don&#039;t know how it was delivered or what officer&#039;s perceptions were of what was provided.
1,10294,2180,10227,PSU officers did a fantastic job-even when faced with firearms. The skill with which they switched from serious disorder on Saturday/Sunday night to peacekeeping on Sunday and afterwards was brilliantly executed.
1,10295,2174,10254,We need to invest in training to meet firearms threat in public order scenarios.
1,10296,2160,10254,The shortage of appropriately trained drivers with a van grade/authorisation potentially left us vulnerable and placed those officers who were van drivers under additional pressure.
1,10297,2171,10231,Do we have the right people with the right training available to fulfill command roles. A cadre syatem could work better.
1,10298,2175,10222,Couldn&#039;t get hold of silver commander when he was in meetings/briefings. His staff wouldn&#039;t interrupt his meetings. F3 seriously needed help and didn&#039;t get it. The whole of the Soho Road could have gone up!
1,10299,2157,10221,First weekend provision of food and in particular water was poor. This should have been anticipated and provided.
1,10300,2165,10224,The two departments trained together at an early stage to provide new tactics to support unarmed officers when the threat became unacceptable for them to cope with on the street. Baton gunin public order tactics and firearms/baton gun in public order tactics.
1,10301,2170,10253,This would have not been such an issue if people had exercised discipline in communcating via theirs commanders and not as if there involved innormal policing via a &quot;control&quot;
1,10302,2169,10234,the appointing of a sandwich zar
1,10303,2153,10232,Difficult to media manage speculation about an unsubstantiated incident - can this be handled better in the future?
1,10304,2177,10220,Over reliance on Bishop Webley actually prompted us to go to Lozells for the end of demonstartion gathering. Had we not taken everyone to Lozells would we have had disorder?
1,10305,2176,10231,We need a dedicated inner circle of bronzes and silvers, to assist continuity of command and knowledge and to pass the baton among a small, well-briefed cohort.
1,10306,2161,10274,Under estimated the community impact of the church event
1,10307,2159,10230,Mixed messages from commanders not to ask youthsto remove face coverings.
1,10308,2180,10231,I should have invovlved Crime Support at an earlier stage - they responded very well but earlier involvment would have been useful.
1,10309,2173,10229,feeding was an issue and started badly did improve as the days ent on!
1,10310,2172,10224,There was clearly a gap in knowledge of the use of firearms in public order situations. However, WMP quickly demonstraed its professionalism in drawing together plans that were delivered well and were proven in the deployment to contained a group armed with a firearm.
1,10311,2161,10233,Is normal busines a retention of chronic tension within the community
1,10312,2166,10231,There should be an agreed level of support resourcing within each level of the command structure, reviewable once the incident is underway
1,10313,2170,10234,We quelled the disorders in a couple of hours - that was really helpful
1,10314,2158,10222,officers listening to AO1 deployed themselves as they felt communication had broken down - positive for the community as on two occassions saved I.P&#039;s -
1,10315,2171,10231,On the Saturday there was no consideration of staff officers for bronze commanders which presented problems in documenting decisions and utilising the command channel.
1,10316,2169,10230,a system for gather and storing of evidence from egt needed to be put in place
1,10317,2181,10234,Despite an officer being shot and civilian fatalities, the number of police officer&#039;s injured was small compared with level of disorder and other comparable events e.g rioting in West Yorkshire.
1,10318,2167,10231,Too much hands on interference outside of their identified roles in the Gold/Silver/Bronze structure
1,10319,2173,10226,Hot de-briefing a major issue, formal de-briefs are fine but there is a need for a hot de-brief within the first 24 hours.
1,10320,2159,10254,Officers are regularly trained for scenarios however offciers were intructed to do things against training. ie use of handcuffs.
1,10321,2161,10233,normal busines a long way off because of the harm in the community from the disorde. Handsworth Wood as wel as Lozells and Aston
1,10322,2177,10227,Gold command was disjointed at peak of disorder, at some point the gold commander changed - but when?
1,10323,2180,10222,At key times, it was difficlut to find the right balance between supporting Silver and getting in the way.
1,10324,2154,10231,different direction and confusion from gold commanders...depending on who was gold, at times no clarity or direction from certain ACPO officer.<br />gold should have remained with ACC  shaw  who have a understanding and grasp from the outset of the role and reposnsibilities of a gold commander<br />other acpo officers highlighted there lack of understanding and knowledge of role and their need to train
1,10325,2160,10223,The ongoing risk assessment was not managed poperly, it was disappointing that gold commander did not receive assistance from corporate health and safety department, it was left to oficers within gold control to complete the appropriate risk assessment documentation.
1,10326,2176,10232,Well handled by just two &#039;talking heads&#039;
1,10327,2182,10225,Dynamic intelligence was not provided to PSU officers &#039;on the ground&#039;
1,10328,2170,10227,There were some excellent examples of leadership at all levels - there were also other occasions when things could have been better
1,10329,2175,10232,Usual politically correct nonsense that this was just about criminally minded people when it was really  about substantial minority of two communities who seriously don&#039;t like each other.
1,10330,2170,10227,ACPO were very interested and involved
1,10331,2172,10222,On occasions, where live intelligence existed, this could have been better communicated to those in critical roles...i.e silver commanders, firearms silver, and gold executives.
1,10332,2177,10222,F3 OCU was aware of disorder in Handsworth but struggled to get a response to it.
1,10333,2175,10234,It could have been a lot worse!
1,10334,2169,10231,a number of commanders were bypassing the command structure and coming straight to gold, causing problems for them in gold
1,10335,2159,10225,The initial briefing on day 1 (prior to disorder) which was a video feed was good, but bore no relevance to actual deployment.
1,10336,2155,10231,Command communication structure failed as command channel being used for operational communication.  RADS also took control of channel and were making decisions.
1,10337,2171,10227,Guides should have been considered for those officers coming into the area from outside OCU`s. Many officers from Coventry had no knowledge of the F3 and this hampered deployment.
1,10338,2161,10223,Understanding the impact on the lead up to the majot disorder upon the Asian business community.
1,10339,2154,10230,whilst we use egt in this force, we should use FIT teams (forward intel teams)this would have &quot;spotted&quot; problems and situations earlier
1,10340,2159,10234,Declared a critical incident at an early stage due to community implications.
1,10341,2167,10228,Risk assessments undertaken which were there to satisfy audit trail rather than being utilised in the decision making process.
1,10342,2175,10253,Don&#039;t think we could ever have sufficient capacity to deal with such an out break, but perhaps it could have been better.
1,10343,2176,10227,Abject lack of involvement (and subsequent, panic-led over-reactions) by council skewed the way WMP had to do business. They are highly culpable, and hiding.
1,10344,2166,10227,Gold was a committee rather than an identified commander. This presented problems with instructions being given by ACPO ranking officers who were not the designated Gold
1,10345,2170,10230,How do we refresh training for EGTs
1,10346,2165,10221,The firearms department provided an &#039;Armed Ambulance&#039; manned by FOU to extract injured officers when normal ambulances would not attend and deliver patients to a nominated RV. Equipment included defibrilator and oxygen with real time advice from a doctor/surgeon.
1,10347,2177,10228,We didnt sem to risk assess the idea of using the church in Lozells as an end point for th demonstration.
1,10348,2161,10223,Concentration pre majot disorder on african caribbean community in terms of mediation
1,10349,2169,10232,the press office were no geared up for the events of the weekend not enough staff,
1,10350,2154,10233,normal business in force stopped, no resilience
1,10351,2180,10231,There needs to be clarity of purpose and role around the &quot;Gold&quot; question. Gold is not just a person, it is also a function ie Gold Control and also a Group. We need to clarify these roles/functions, who does what. There needs to be one Gold Commander-particulalry in Gold Control and Gold meetings.
1,10352,2173,10231,There were times when the structure did work and I felt that there was clear direction, the changing of &#039;gold&#039; is often necessary due to periods of rest and I was happy with that. No this is not an ACC!
1,10353,2160,10320,Officer should be able to link all the necessary training together when deployed to a dynamic situation like this
2,10354,0,0,Your definition of a Critical Incident
1,10355,2172,10230,The whole issue of EGTs and their use in public order situations needs reviewing. On one occasion they were left behind by the PSU they were attached to and this is unacceptable.
1,10356,2166,10223,Lack of leadership from lower ranking supervisors allowed officers to be deployed without the correct PPE
1,10357,2171,10224,On the Saturday the deployment of dog resources caused problems as they were self deploying with little command of those resources evident.
1,10358,2161,10231,OCU local input into silver control - was it where we want it to be?
1,10359,2175,10253,Force control room were so difficult when was asked if F3 jobs adjoining K, H and D OCU&#039;s could be dealt with by them.
1,10360,2159,10254,Vehicles were borrowed from outside forces, however driver training was identified and resulted in staff not being deployed to receive this training.
1,10361,2154,10226,we never ever learn from our debriefs...which are few and far between,
1,10362,2182,10227,The involvement of representatives of partner agencies and a member of the Police Authority (who is also extremely active within the black community) at Gold meetings stifled debate around sensitive issues
1,10363,2170,10257,We did very well for the first 24 / 48 hours - it became difficult to sustain that over 10 days - we need to think more about how best to resource prolonged incidents of this kind
1,10364,2177,10340,Not many people knew what a critical incident was tho&#039;
1,10365,2161,10234,Disorder limited to a few hours
1,10366,2180,10224,We need to train our PSU&#039;s around the public order with firearms scenarios. We will also need to consider the equipment issues that are required to support these tactical options.
1,10367,2167,10257,Tours of duty highly impactive on officers, ignored issues of relieving staff coming on duty on time.
1,10368,2159,10227,Too many chiefs resulting in mixed messages to the workers
1,10369,2165,10256,The OSU/FOU had to borrow 10 armoured landrovers to enable Firearms/Public Order tactics to be able to be deployed within a public order firearms scenario.
1,10370,2177,10234,We mobilised a lot of resources in good time. Officers were well equipped and trained.
1,10371,2173,10224,Having now established that at least 10 separate firearms were used the urgency to deploy firearms in a public order situation with speed is critical
1,10372,2161,10229,Initial impact of potentially lethal rioting upon staff deployed at the front end of the disorder
1,10373,2170,10222,On occasions there were too many Golds
1,10374,2183,10223,incomplete intelligence picture and and intelligence flows undermined risk assessment process.<br />a common understanding of threat eg intent and capability and risk eg probability and impact was not apparent.<br />Unrealist expectations of command in terms of predictions based upon intelligence assessment.<br />Informatiion is not intelligence. Evaluation process not fully understood. Professional judgement was required from senior level.<br />The intelligence requirement was set a SPOC established but was not adequately resourced.<br />Intelligence Assets need to be co-located to ensure that there is a balanced focus on the varying threats.
1,10375,2175,10234,Despite any criticisms I have I think we&#039;re quite professional.
1,10376,2169,10257,the same senior officers were working within the structure from gold suite o firearms commander some senior officers were not forth coming, to carryout any role there were other who rang from their holiday to see if they could help.
1,10377,2161,10232,Structured messages into the meda addressing key points from gold
1,10378,2159,10221,Officers deployed to standby or holding positions that offered no facilities for &#039;welfare breaks&#039;, extremely difficult for males in PO kit...impossible for females.
1,10379,2177,10232,How can we manage pirate radio stations better?
1,10380,2181,10257,The different shift patterns meant that assumptions regarding PSU&#039;s working hours could not be made. e.g. some PSUs indicated that there were due for earlies on Sunday at 2am - I thought that when mobilised the officers came from late shifts - appraently not.
1,10381,2154,10254,lack of trained silver and bronzes....same old faces being asked to do the jobs,people happy to have the course but do not want to put themselves out when required...advocate a cadre system for silver bronze and tac advisors to ensure they are up to date and current
1,10382,2161,10232,Consistency through a single media lead for the police
1,10383,2182,10222,The lack of a formalised sytem for passing live intelligence to Gold and Silver led to confusion
1,10384,2170,10222,The consistency in Ops C/Supt and Supt supporting Gold was useful but tiring for the staff involved - perhaps we need to expand our capacity to do that work.
1,10385,2171,10231,During the change over of Bronze commanders PSU`s were left on the ground without an effective command structure in place. At one point on the Saturday evening at around 10pm all but one of the bronze commanders were called into D1 for a briefing. Staff were left exposed on the ground and silver were not deploying resources to seats of disorder. suggest dedicated briefing officers are involved in the process and a staggered changeover of commanders.
1,10386,2176,10225,INTELLIGENCE has disappeared, so I&#039;ll use this. There was too much reliance put on community intelligence being &#039;confirmed&#039; by sources (which were hearing the same rumour, but giving it unwarranted credibility) therefore confirming certain things which were really based on community rumour, and should not have had that level of confidence. This then skewed briefings and plans.
1,10387,2169,10254,senior officers who have recent silver experience or who are trained was lacking
1,10388,2177,10220,The City Council never sent anyone of any seniority before, during or after the disorder - they seemed to treat is purely as a policing issue.
1,10389,2170,10254,Training was effective in delivering the capacity to achieve early resolution
1,10390,2175,10233,It&#039;s got back to normal almost as quickly as it blew up. So it could blow up just as quickly again, or it could be another 20 years!
1,10391,2167,10254,Insufficiant trained staff to provide for turnaround of officers. Most staff were posted continually to Javari over the whole operation impacting on their health, personal relationships and their own work back on OCU
1,10392,2157,10220,Did the use of interlocutors have any impact at all? Disorder of some kind was always going to happen.
1,10393,2155,10254,Police Staff within Silver/Gold structure should receive training so they can support the command structure.
1,10394,2172,10253,This area needs reviewing. Many critical incidents were either just left or ignored during the early part of the disorder. This left communities vulnerable and without the protection of the police. This resulted in a number of shootings and in my view we just got away with it and were fortunate there were no fatalities.
1,10395,2154,10224,we let training fou and psus (eg baton guns) lapse and we were found wanting resulting in hastily arranged tactics
1,10396,2183,10222,information was not disemminated within  Gold on a time critical basis and staff seemed unaware of their roles
1,10397,2161,10303,Community have raised issue of police being responsible for managing rumour and speculation - is this appropriate criticism? Could we have dealt with the rumour differently
1,10398,2180,10222,We need to ask hard questions about not just what roles we need to fill in critical aspects of the operation but also, who is best equipped to do this role eg where we have a pre planned high risk operation chose the best people to run it - not all people are good at all roles just becuase they have the rank. not a criticism-just a fact
2,10399,0,0,Intelligence
1,10400,2159,10233,We appeared to stand off for too long to pacify the community. What happened was that we alienated ourselves from the majority to pacify the minority (trouble makers) . Evidenced by the response from the Afro Carribbean Centre that was housing young children where the hostility to the Police was &quot;What kept you so long&quot;.
1,10401,2177,10221,The force really should review its position on canteens. Using outside mobile catering is better than nothing but only just.
1,10402,2169,10253,gold should not be the place where calls from pcs who are calling into to confirm deployment details or if they are being fed
1,10403,2173,10254,There are no trained SIM (Scene Incident Managers) within the force. If the situation developed into mass casualties etc then this role would be vital. This is an area we are attempting to redress.
1,10404,2170,10226,We need to routinely debrief our staff after key operations in a structred format and be willing and keen to learn fron the experience
1,10405,2160,10227,The foce should have been placed on 2 hour shifts and officers deployed to Javari exracted from normal duties for the length of he operation.  Officers on OCU would have back filled extractions and management could have used overtime to ensure normal business was attended to.
1,10406,2153,10349,In an ideal situation, press officers should have been in gold, on the ground and in the office. Difficult with only one duty press officer and no formal resilience.
1,10407,2161,10397,The mangement of the rumour was considered and handled by impact upon the African Caribbean community, not the Asian  Community. A weakness in our approach in hindsight
1,10408,2176,10234,We did really well: behind the scenes work mitigated a much worse situation, while a positive up-front response kept the lid on it. It&#039;s a pity about Cpthall Road, etc. which will always be remembered but it must not detract from an overall good job.
1,10409,2180,10232,Press Office &quot;fed&quot; the media effectively - this played  a large part in keeping them &quot;on-side&quot;.
1,10410,2158,10226,officers have still not been de briefed which ties in with welfare - officers wish the opportunity to speak to senior managers and for views to be valued
1,10411,2183,10222,confusion as to where intelligence assessments should in the first instance be directed to. Gold or Silver?
1,10412,2154,10222,f3 management trying ti interfere with force strategic plan.
1,10413,2170,10224,Public order training and firearms staff were confident and competent
1,10414,2171,10222,Staff based at Thornhill Rd within the CSB felt scared that the disorder was out of control on the Saturday night particularly after an officer had been shot. The location of Thornhill Rd made it a possible target for those involved in the disorder. There was no thought given to station security and the safety of unprotected officers within the building. Vehicles  were being set ablaze just a few streets from the station.
1,10415,2175,10232,Why haven&#039;t we been stronger in condemning the malicious false rumours that resulted in lives being lost? Are we still pussyfooting around because of the people involved?
1,10416,2167,10253,Ownership of  incidents reported by the public to the Police via 999 system and other methods during the Saturday and Sunday was lost in not having an effective linkedcommand structure for both incidents of disorder and usual business calls.
1,10417,2159,10225,The brief stated that no &#039;organiser&#039; had come forward and therefore Section 14 PO Act orders were not applicable. It seemed later in the day that everyone knew who was &#039;incharge&#039; the route and anticipated numbers. More advanced planning could have kept us in control
1,10418,2161,10379,Recognition of the impact of this medium in communicating to one section of the community
1,10419,2182,10220,This event hi-lighted the fact that Key Individual Networks across the Force Area are not fit for purpose and comprise, predominanly, of individuals who pass only positive feedback and who are not best placed to provide a true picture of tensions.
1,10420,2176,10231,Uplands etc shows a need for local knowledge (PS/Insp) in silver to explain the relevance of things to an outside silver commander, who can never have perfect local knowledge.
1,10421,2181,10399,Prior to events the planning was all about the demonstration and march but not cencerning potential disorder. Officers post event spoke of knowing it was going to kick off, that intelligence was not communicated to Silver.
1,10422,2157,10222,A feeling on the ground that on the first Saturday Silver was poor.  Did not respond to changing situations or needs promptly enough.
1,10423,2161,10223,The chronic tension in the community was under the police community impact assessment
1,10424,2154,10234,we did quell the disorder v quickly
1,10425,2177,10267,We need to seriously consider how famale colleagues can get by with a one piece suit and no proper comfort breaks.
1,10426,2172,10225,The gold group meeting included partner agencies for much of the time. This was very useful. However, on occasions, sensitive information required discussion and debate, which couldnt be shared with partners and vital decisions may have been lost. Towards the end this was recognised and a separate brief for internal staff was set up. This needs to be remembered for next time.
1,10427,2181,10347,In hindsight it was the worst location to have it - considerable resources had to be deployed to secure senior police officers and it became a site of disorder.
1,10428,2165,10231,It seemed strange to me that a DSO was required to deploy Batons Guns in public Order situations but not a Firearms deployment. Why do we need a DSO. It wastes time waiting for them to deploy and is another Command level to deal with. Would they really overrule a Bronze asking for the assistance of Baton guns/Firearms.
1,10429,2171,10222,On the Saturday night it appeared that no consideration was given to implementing an exclusion zone around the localised are of disorder in Handswoth and Lozells. Many innocent motorists were entering the area and being attacked by those involved in the disorder.
1,10430,2159,10228,decision to keep level one trained staff on standby for so long. It was not until they were deployed that the violence was quelled and youths dispersed. Could earlier deployment have had same effect?
1,10431,2169,10399,there was no link into gold for he intelligence for example the commander would find out at the 5pm meeting that a demo was planned but this was too late for gold controls/ coordinators who were not informed and were being questioned by acc&#039;s and above as for the resourcing implications required for the demo
1,10432,2153,10397,Media say communities were telling them of rumour and then referring back to us for statements.
1,10433,2158,10399,failing to evaluate correctley caused problems
1,10434,2161,10423,under the police radar systems
1,10435,2154,10234,changing the sandwich supplier and having a hot meal
1,10436,2159,10234,Quick and positive action to identify and arrest murderers.
1,10437,2173,10234,Both murders have been detected the post incident investigation is progresing very well with a well resourced and well managed investigation.<br />The media coverage was in the main very positive. The families of the deceased have also been supportive that has helped to keep the media &#039;off our backs&#039;
1,10438,2161,10233,Role of partnership in reducing tension
1,10439,2174,10233,This critical incident consumed all available OSU &amp; Firearms resources - leaving very little for the rest of the Force where normal business went on.  For the 2nd largest Force in the country I question the size &amp; resilience of these small central depts to support the Force appropriately.
1,10440,2181,10222,The change over from &quot;event&quot; Silver to &quot;disorder&quot; silver was prolonged.
1,10441,2155,10222,Did Gold know the true picture of what was happening during the critical period of disorder.  Silver had no resources to use when AO was tracking a group &#039;looting&#039; and Gold still refused to utilise the Gold Reserve.
1,10442,2180,10231,Gold and silver were underresourced-people worked too long.
1,10443,2175,10221,The F3 bought everyone a MacDonalds and that was much appreciated!
1,10444,2177,10229,We placed an unfair burden on one PSU that was deployed without carriers at the height of the disorder.
1,10445,2172,10233,There was a reluctence to move to incremental normallity. Long after the event, PSUs were still being deployed at 0700hrs, when there was clearly no need for them, thus impacting on other areas of the force and wasting resources.
1,10446,2183,10225,I dont believe we actually understand what we mean by community intelligence? It requires defining. It is community information until such time it has been evaluated and provenanced
1,10447,2159,10229,Common standards of post incident appreciation/recognition. Some OCU&#039;s have already awarded staff with bonus payments whilst others have gone unrecognised. No consistency across Force.
1,10448,2177,10237,The change from functional to territorial bronzes was not well planned for.
1,10449,2167,10226,The initial electronic debriefing was available for two days immediately after the conclusion of Javari at which point, suprisingly enough, the main participants had gone on some well deserved leave and were not therfore able to contribute.
1,10450,2176,10233,The pressure on local staff (D1/F3) was PHENOMENOL. They had to stand by while others made operational decisions that would affect their local policing relationships for years to come. It is right to have outside silvers, but local commanders must continue to exert influence and i disagree dundamantally with the comment re F3 having too much influence.
1,10451,2160,10399,There was an apparent breakdown in he quality and quantity of intelligence that was available and how it was being fed into the operation.  At one point we were presented with a list of some 70 to 80 vehicle registrations, no make, model or colour given, no PNC checks were done and there was no disernable link between the vehicles, the operation or any person(s) involved. The intelligence function needed a more physical presence with the command structure it was too remote.
1,10452,2161,10224,Risk reduction, series of warrants on weend of 30/31. Not planned to sufficient detail - did not understand the impact on the community
1,10453,2169,10224,public order training to involve a firearms input into their tacttics its alright saying the osu do this but this was all hands to the pump and we only have so many on the osu
1,10454,2172,10234,The tactics developed for firearms deployment in public order situations was tested  in real time and worked well.
1,10455,2159,10224,Use of AO1... officers changed to ground to air channel but this effectively became self deployments outside of Bronze control.
1,10456,2154,10254,lack of spare protected vans, always always crops up wether its javari or ocu football and never gets resolved!
1,10457,2181,10298,Silver&#039;s capacity as the single point of decision making during disorder is questionable.
1,10458,2177,10305,We must get away from the &#039;usual suspects&#039; doing all the command roles for firearms, public order, cbrn, etc. We have little resilience
1,10459,2180,10431,This is a good point. We need to work out how we feed intell into Gold and Silver without causing confusion or delaying decision making. This needs some work
1,10460,2169,10221,officers to ensure next of kin details on the oasis system are upto date this was a huge problem when officers were injuried
1,10461,2182,10234,The different Bureaux within Force Intelligence combined to provide the first  Joint Intelligence Cell (JIC). Lessons were learned and the disciplines developed are transferable to other Critical Incidents. A Departmental protocol is in the process of being drafted to formalise the future  establishment of JICs
1,10462,2161,10253,Recognition of the high volue of incidents and calls at the critical period
1,10463,2183,10399,Gold control were being dynamically informed of critical intelligence the failure was to process manage that within gold with caller takers not having a structure with which to take the information to
1,10464,2159,10226,Excellent idea to utilise this facility wher an archaeic system would inevitably mean pats on the back and promotion when lessons could and should be learnt.
1,10465,2171,10231,Some of the staff deployed to silver as operators had no knowledge of the command structure involved in a disorder scenarion and the workings of gold/silver/bronze.
1,10466,2180,10399,Intell was underresourced-the move to Aqua House the same weekend was an unfortunate coincidence - perhaps should have been held back but I undertsand why it wasn&#039;t at the time
2,10467,0,0,Did the Force policy hold up to the reality of the incident
1,10468,2170,10224,There were occaions when officers self deployed to incidents with the best of intentions - on occasions some officers put themslves at risk
1,10469,2159,10226,officers are now being asked for statements, however OASIS logs do not appear to contain details of staff deployed on PSU&#039;s creating a nightmare for investigators.
1,10470,2181,10399,In hindsight Intelligence cell needs of Silver Command were not adequately anticipated.
1,10471,2161,10241,Good for sensitively dealing with the &#039;peaceful demonstrtaion&#039;. However did it have an impact on the policing style when it needed to be steped up against a rising threat
1,10472,2182,10234,A SPOC has been established with OFCOM so that issues around the use of Pirate Radio stations can be managed better in future
1,10473,2180,10234,The professional handling of the Post Incident Investigation of the shooting was text book .
1,10474,2153,10232,Frustration with media hijacking vital CCTV images before police and then broadcasting them.
1,10475,2158,10399,incidents on 20th clearly showed that asain shops in lozells were vulnerable - this did not seem to be taken into account in deployment of staff on 22nd
1,10476,2177,10428,I find it hard to se how we will ever use baton rounds. When the threat is from a mobile crowd armed with conventional firearms, there is little point firing batons at them.
1,10477,2154,10399,force intel poor.....did not update the op enough
1,10478,2180,10234,IPCC support after the shooting was critical - that could have turned nasty for us if rumours had perssited that this was a police shooting.
1,10479,2159,10443,However no veggie option!
1,10480,2165,10224,The firearms capability was stretched in providing 24 hour cover to the disorder so that normal force firearms commitments were very limited
1,10481,2169,10257,a real problem was that on the weekend of the disorder the helicopter did not have a pilot until 3pm this was an importent tool that could not be used by lack of thought on the helicopter department
1,10482,2154,10247,fully agree
1,10483,2167,10244,Public Order Overalls were inappropriate for the length of time officers were deployed. Two piece suits are both more practical and comfortable
1,10484,2170,10392,I think they have a positive influence but probably a little too much
1,10485,2173,10232,Press office need to take a firmer control of press conferences. Employ a system of taking names of all those in attendance, this would be of use to the SIO to make approaches for news footage. It would also prevent &#039;uninvited&#039; people attending the conferences.  At one conference an individul was filming the events using his mobile phone was he a genuine reporter? Someone from the office should also &#039;front&#039; the conference and stop it when needed instead of a drift stuation where you can feel trapped by the reporters
1,10486,2172,10278,I disagree. As soon as the officer had been shot, firearms officers were deployed and were on scene within two minutes. It wasnt for F3 to have knowledge, Siver and Gold command were both aware as soon as it happended.
1,10487,2177,10419,I disagree, I think OCUs are aware that KINs are not the &#039;usual suspects&#039; - the F3 seemed well aware of the rising tension.
1,10488,2167,10256,Vehicles unable to carry numbers of staff and equipment necessary if a fully deployed PSU with medics EGT  and PSU commanders
1,10489,2180,10304,Good question and one that troubles me even now. At the time we needed to find a way to &quot;close&quot; the demo - Derek Webleys offer seemed like a sensible/sensitive way forward.
1,10490,2161,10264,In hindsight yes- better contingency planning, but emphasis on planning was to police a demonstration during the afternoon
1,10491,2154,10244,no it wasnt every one should have 2 piece suits...supplies unit should have addressed this x2 years ago when identified!
1,10492,2171,10222,On the saturday lunchtime there were major problems with Airwave and this left commanders and officers on the ground particularly outside the hairdressers feeling exposed. For over an hour communication was intermittent at best having to resort to the use of mobile phones and officers being used as `runners` on the ground. If this problem had occurred later in the day when there was real disorder many officers could have been exposed to lethal force without support from colleagues.
1,10493,2175,10414,It was considered and the first judgement call was to leave the station front office open. It was only members of csb who raised this issue, not people who were working downstairs. There was never any reports that disorder was nearing Thornhill Road.
1,10494,2169,10339,fit teams used at g8 were found to be over whelmed by the crowd in scotland things were not as violent and there were not the firearms fit teams at night in handsworth following the trashing of the public orde vans and the level of violence would not have been safe for the officers
1,10495,2177,10392,I suspect we focussed too much on the black community, and didn&#039;t engage with asian youth enough.
1,10496,2154,10256,no spare vehicles again!
1,10497,2166,10350,Until there is some central control over the shift patterns this force works, then resilience will continue to be an issue.
1,10498,2183,10470,Why did silver need an intell cell along side them? The intelligence was flowing out of the SPOC and required people to make decisions. Not realistic to expect an intelligence officer to do that. There was evidence of a comfort blanket factor in having intell staff present in Silver. Utilised to photocopy and make tea. Best use of resources?
1,10499,2173,10410,Fully support this needs to be a priority!
1,10500,2180,10388,Council&#039;s response throughout has been disappointing-we cannot afford to be resigned to this situation, the issue must be to get them on board and committed to plan of action rather than leaving everything to police
1,10501,2175,10429,Yes I saw on CCTV a number of lucky escapes for motorists.
1,10502,2181,10253,This is the first major disorder we have had in the era of mobile phones - information overload was a critical issue due to numbers of calls.
1,10503,2165,10240,Neither were the FOU. We need to keep FOU/OSU trained up in these tactics but need the appropriate vehicles too. I believe that most future large scale disorder will involve criminal use of firearms and we have a duty to unarmed officers to be suitably trained and equipped to assist them
1,10504,2157,10222,PSUs kept o/s church on Lozells Rd &quot;guarding&quot; two vans that had been attacked and damaged.Kept there for hours when could have been deployed elsewhere.  Requests made to get vehicles moved remained unactioned
1,10505,2172,10343,Agreed. This needs some fast work and they need to be held to account. However, it is a large monolith and people will hide!
1,10506,2170,10298,The Bronze Commander could have directed the staff to get hold of Silver or called Gold to resolve the issue
1,10507,2167,10391,The idea that only a certain percentage of the force should be trained resulted in the same officers being required to perform roles continually. Review training needs both in general public order training but also the specialist roles.
1,10508,2161,10332,Dnamic risk assessment at F3 was that it was unsafe to send unprotected OCU resources. A clear message not sent to Silver that response here was expected from resources under silver control. Consequently did Silver fully understand what was happening on the ground
1,10509,2177,10489,I suspect it precipitated something that was likely to happen. We knew early on saturday that there were asian shops closed and asian youths out on the streets. I suspect the die was cast by then.
1,10510,2171,10314,Totally agree and as a bronze i used this method to self depoly to Newbury Rd where disorder was taking place. prevented McDonalds being looted at Newtown shopping centre by a group of around 30-40 hostiles.
1,10511,2180,10419,We do need to rethink who is on our KIN&#039;s and what we share with them.
1,10512,2170,10314,And on occasions put themselves at risk
1,10513,2166,10428,ACPO Guide to Keeping the Peace determines the use of a DSO
1,10514,2160,10269,PSU supervisors should have told oficers to remove reflective jackets
1,10515,2153,10485,That is a good point that is continually pushed within the office and is being put into place where we can. I think the press officer dealing with the conference and the SIO have to agree clear boundaries beforehand so we both know when the point comes to stop the conference.
1,10516,2181,10234,As someone on the OSU  the ground in 1985 Lozells riots this went a whole lot better!
1,10517,2173,10319,Crime Support are attempting to put together a de-brief booklet for use on all critical incdents.  This has come from the &#039;Stanstead&#039; de-briefs, it is a Met document that we have &#039;West Midland ised&#039;
1,10518,2154,10373,force wanted to have 2 golds at one stage lack of understanding by certain acpo of their role and responsibilities....clearly out of depth
1,10519,2176,10227,I saw fantastic leadership at all levels throughout, and very few things to criticise.
1,10520,2180,10443,I,m lovin it!
1,10521,2170,10331,The intellegnce capacity was in the wrong place - it was a daily update service for Gold Meetings it shold have been more than this and informed Silvers tactical plan
1,10522,2169,10296,this has been an issue fr at least 3 years ocus are not taking this seriously as for normal saturday night van patrols this event highlighted the problem now lets address it
1,10523,2177,10491,In their defence they are trying to. The latest product on trial burns - that&#039;s no use either.
1,10524,2172,10280,Its time the force invested in video conferencing...which has been available for some years now..this would have prevented silver commander being at HQ and not in command of the incident.
1,10525,2181,10233,The Force is set up to deliver Sector Policing but is vulnerable at times of crisis.
1,10526,2161,10429,Organisational knowledge of applying trained tactics at a critical time. Tactical plan for creating a sterile area around the key seat of disorder in Lozells
1,10527,2173,10230,The quality of footage from AO1 is not particulary good was there a EGT deployed in the aircraft?
1,10528,2167,10381,There is a need for a cadre of specialist roles to maximise effectiveness and  experience with a training and shadowing policy to provide resilience.
1,10529,2171,10493,There were vehicles being burnt out in Radnor Rd less than five minutes walk from the station. maybe those in the front office were not as aware of what was actually taking place as those working within the intel function in the CSB.
1,10530,2174,10324,Agreed  -Gold need to stay in role &amp; not get involved in tactical decisions.  Continuity &amp; consistency of command will always be an issue in incidents that run over several days.
1,10531,2154,10398,i agree certain senior managers looked at jobs as rank specific not role specific....lot of experience not utilised
1,10532,2177,10256,Transport office had real problems getting vehicles from other forces, the force does not seem to be smelling the coffee on this issue.
1,10533,2181,10504,There were immediate attempts to get the Vans moved as there was with a dog van that broke down but it didn&#039;t happen.
1,10534,2174,10315,Force should agree a standard deployment that is approriate fto provide Bronze support (&amp; indeed Gold &amp; Silver support).
1,10535,2161,10223,No risk assessment of polce atending the church event.
1,10536,2173,10461,Fully supported the concept of a JIC worked
1,10537,2183,10477,The intelligence products that came to be relied upon by the strategic command were only as good as the response to the intelligence reqirement that was set. Intelligence that came from sensitive intelligence assets had significant impact on the strategy to reduce the threat from Urban Street gangs who were using the scenario as an opportunity to exploit and expand their theatre of operations
1,10538,2170,10422,The change from public meeting to public disorder was gradual - If we had moved from one to the other more quickly the police would have been blamed for inciting  the disorder by being heavy handed
1,10539,2176,10229,Many people worked very long hours indeed. I only hope that they would have been supported by the force if they made a mistake due to exhaustion!
1,10540,2153,10232,Force needs to invest in a comprehensive media monitoring service rather than relying on staff, who are already tied up with the incident, to read papers, listen to radio, watch TV
1,10541,2159,10293,This was done &#039;in house&#039; and was in depth and suitable with the correct people involved.
1,10542,2182,10477,Dedicated cell worked 24/7 and handled all intel relevant to event. Dynamic intel was fed to silvers immediately and intel summary docs provided twice daily for Gold meetings.
1,10543,2177,10518,Not fair. The only problem was gold commander getting sucked into brieifngs at height of disorder.
1,10544,2169,10234,we did not have a paris so we did well well done f3 management
1,10545,2161,10392,Yes- had a significant impact upon reducing scale, length and subsequent repeat of the disorder
1,10546,2173,10478,The IPCC present at the press conference was a good idea and worked well
1,10547,2166,10305,There are sufficient numbers trained, it is just that many are happy to have it on their CV and nothing more. A dedicated cadre managed from the centre is desperately need. That way both incidents of this nature and routine matters such as football can be catered for well in advance and with experienced trained commanders.
1,10548,2177,10414,any they wanted to put silver there!
1,10549,2165,10395,Thats true but with all the other new commitments such as Suicide Killers, CBRN and meeting the demands of the force for firearms operations something had to give, unfortunately not having had a public order problem for 10 yrs was also a factor.
1,10550,2170,10304,Who knows - I think it was a sound decision at the time
1,10551,2174,10346,Should be an SOP for the Force in these situations.
1,10552,2180,10441,There was a delay in Gold being fully aware-not sure why this occurred. In every major Gold/silver I have worked this happens at key moments - fog of battle? - not a good explanation and uncomfortable to review but this does happen.
1,10553,2167,10423,Who is trained to conduct this type of risk assessment and which role  is best suited to carryout such a task????
1,10554,2170,10414,We need to think about this more at the time
1,10555,2173,10220,Do we need an IAG?
1,10556,2161,10304,Key point and worthy of reflection. There is a ossibilkity that not going ahead with the event could have avoided the disorder. In real time however, the intention was to disperse the crowd from Wellington Road. It could wel have been that the disorder was in Perry Barr rather than Lozells
1,10557,2160,10305,There is a need for a cadre system across the whole public order arena, from PSU PC to Gold Commander, with all being made subject to a robust assessment against competencies.
1,10558,2167,10288,who is assesing this information.
1,10559,2181,10231,Had there not been a football match at the Villa and the local commander available as a deployable bronze (with resources) it would have been very much more difficult to deal with.
1,10560,2180,10234,Force has to take great credit - a lot of people wanted violence, not enough were prepared to do anything to prevent it, we have emereged with reputation enhanced
1,10561,2171,10221,Mnay staff still,working on the F3 remain scared and this needs to be considered by the force.
1,10562,2181,10231,Problems getting an SIO for the murder. Identified SIO not immediately available.
1,10563,2181,10299,Allegedly it was available but when requested was inadequate.
1,10564,2154,10344,this happened a lot
1,10565,2174,10395,Force needs to maintain credible &amp; current capability in this discipline.

1,10579,2166,10568,We recognised that people who work together in situations like this need to know each other wll and have trust and confidence in each other.  Perhaps there is an opportunity for those who perform these roles to work together a couple of times per year.
1,10580,2172,10574,Ownership of vehicle &amp; fleet types should be with Operations/Planning.
1,10581,2170,10577,The use of resources specialists left for long periods on standby.<br />Recognising the need to train across the force as opposed to multi training one department. Thus freeing up resources and reducing the drain and expactancy of others.
1,10582,2162,10572,Welfare
1,10583,2169,10570,Planning - Investigation Silver has to be involved in the planning stages of any potential Critical Incident. A Gold group was established in the build up to this disorder and any Gold groups convened in future must include a nominated SIO so that evidence gathering considerations are included within briefing and de-briefing of staff.
1,10584,2170,10572,Food Issues
1,10585,2172,10574,Numbers of vehicles to provide resilience for need and mechanical efectiveness

1,10587,2169,10570,Investigators must be used in the briefing and (more importantly) de-briefing of officers so that evidence gathering is considered thoughout.
1,10588,2170,10584,An army marches on its stomach. Officers deployed for prolonged periods of time, should have provision for regular and suitable feeding.<br />Extingies accepted, the productivity of a happy workforce exceeds that of a disgruntled one.
1,10589,2172,10574,Firearms fleet to be reviewed and maintained to meet this trype of need.
1,10590,2169,10570,Facilities - A &#039;fit for purpose&#039; single site to be identified and utilised for this scale of investigation.
1,10591,2166,10568,There are opportunities to accredit comptence and evidence continuous professional development in the key roles - for example through the Advanced Public Order Command Programe.
1,10592,2169,10570,Intelligence - Intelligence Manager must  link in with SIO at an early a stage as possible.
1,10593,2162,10582,Under normal threat levels officers should only work 8 hrs, welfare,duty of care but when the threat is raised and there is more risk of being involved in an incident ,officers are expected to work 12plus hrs. where is the logic?

1,10600,2172,10598,Sufficient numbers of staff both basic public order trained and specialist roles.
1,10601,2162,10572,Once a protracted incident occures specialist posts esp Firearms/OSU lose the ability to provide core policng roles.
1,10602,2153,10571,Press Office resilience<br />Office&#039;s Increased involvement in ops planning, etc<br />SPOC in press office for SIO<br />Clear position from force in dealing with unlawful medium (eg. pirate radio stations)<br />Delay in agreeing media statements<br />Full briefing for officers involved in interface with media<br />Better management of press conferences<br />Increased use of ethnic minority media<br />Improved appreciation of importance of mitigating rumour and speculation<br />Appreciation of how statements can impact on communities<br />Use of comms and reassurance officers to get messages out to communities in other ways than the media<br />Lack of joint statements with city council - more pressure should have been placed on their press office
1,10603,2169,10570,Training, deployment and de-briefing of Evidence Gathering Teams. EGTs must be trained, equippped and briefed to provide the best available evidence as soon after the event as possible
1,10604,2172,10598,Constant review of adherence to Force Policy on specific numbers of specialists i.e. Bronze/silver, EGT, Medic, Drivers,Tac Advisors available 24/7
1,10605,2186,10567,1.  Catering at a large scale event, basically using the Napoleonic metaphor&quot;If you fed them well they will do anything for you&quot;.  Perhaps we need to invest in our own mobile catering capability, or have a call out contract with a mobile caterer.<br />2.  Planning, the force needs a core number of trained staff available for mobilisation on an almost 24/7 basis, or as a minimum between the hours of 0800 and 0200, these staff will be adequately trained to achieve their role within the deployment whether that is a RAD, plotter. staff oficer, PSU PC, Supervisor, or commander<br />3.  Welfare issues, the force should be more proactive in engaing our welfare capability to support staff.  Is there a need for the force to consider a rotation of staff away from busy areas of the force and spread the experience and relieve the pressure that staff feel.
1,10606,2169,10570,Maximise evidence gathering potential of Air Ops. Air Ops to have properly briefed and trained EGT officer on board to maximise the evidnce captured.
1,10607,2170,10599,Who actually owns the operation. Once it goes beyond the boundaries, inter OCU Aid etc, does ownership pass to a &#039;Central&#039; department to control. (Ops and Events Planning)
1,10608,2162,10601,This was also toe case for Ops Planning and event planning.
1,10609,2169,10570,Gold Meetings had &#039;investigation&#039; as the last agenda item and could have been construed as being of lesser importance as a result. Greater importance should have been attached to this item.
1,10610,2172,10598,A core of experienced specialists available to prevent difficulties associated with newly trained or experienced staff being deployed.
1,10611,2172,10595,Prevent early burn out of specialists,
1,10612,2172,10595,The need to cancel ublic order training when specialists are required.
1,10613,2170,10599,Pre planned operations or incidents where a high volume of resources are anticipated, should be managed to reduce the impact on other areas of the force caused by Inter OCU aid. This was evident during Millenium Planning, but has rarely been seen since.
1,10614,2172,10595,Maintain adequite and appropriate vehicle fleet levels
1,10615,2169,10570,Is the Force structured to investigate this type of major incident without causing shortfalls in other priority areas of investigation. Is the MIU the most appropriate unit for this or should there be an alternative
1,10616,2172,10595,Review of training policies.
1,10617,2166,10568,We discussed the role of Gold and whether generally that is best performed by ACPO officers or by specialist Operations Senior Officers - And the need to be mindful of the need for ACPO to be involved and inform thinking and at the same time focus on defining the strategy
1,10618,2166,10568,We recognise the need to maintain the commitment,engagement and enthusiasm of all senior staff
1,10619,2172,10582,Start times for tours for longterm operations to match usual tours of duty.
1,10620,2172,10599,Assessment by Force as to deployment will be  duty time(impactive on local policing issues) or overtime (finacially impactive)
1,10621,2170,10573,The numbers of trained officers in different disciplines should be considered across the force. and allocated to staff who are available. This was an issue due to the front line policing staff not being trained, yet neighbourhood and sector teams who are trained being on leave and unavailable.
1,10622,2166,10568,It might be helpful to understand clearly the communication processes between Gold Silver and Bronze and to have back up communication systems.
1,10623,2169,10570,Composition of Gold group (the presence of non-Police participants) was not condusive to open discussion regarding sensitive issues. Disclosure issues around the minutes of the Gold Group meetings were not fully considered and had the potential to cause some difficulty as part of the investigation disclosure process.
1,10624,2170,10573,Some staff have little or no specialisms whilst others are multi skilled. Thus if some staff are deployed in a PSU this impacts upon the reilience to respond to Terrorist seraches or CBRN threats, etc.<br />Consideration to be given to broaden the spectrum of trained staff.
1,10625,2166,10568,It would be helpful to have accredited senior staff for firearms and public order command with forcewide responsibility - available 24/7.  These may already be available but with some coordination and small change it could be easily delivered
1,10626,2159,10568,Identify personnel key roles and cadre system.  Not only gold/silver but also RADS/Tac etc.<br />On call system to compliment cardre to alleviate ad-hoc phone calls.<br />Hot line between Gold/Silver.<br />Template for key roles/situation.<br />There must be only one Gold commander current Gold  chairs Gold group.<br />One general plus deputy working opposite shifts working A &amp; B team.<br />Authorities for firearm deployments do we require authority for each deployment.<br />Critical incident - we have got the policy but dont buy into it.
1,10627,2172,10582,Identification that Staff need toilets, fluids, food  etc requiring sufficient resources to revolve staff at key locations.
1,10628,2178,10579,Totally agree. As a bronze working with the same tac ad and staff officer helps enormously if the event is prolonged over a period of days. Also a cadre system could be considered.
1,10629,2186,10587,Investigators placed within the command structure whose purpose would be the effective breifing,de-briefing and disseminating of intelligence within the function
1,10630,2172,10577,Early identification of numbers and type of resourcing with an understanding of the impact this will have on source area of these reources. Who will be doing our core policing elsewhere.
1,10631,2169,10570,The rumour concerning the alleged rape was in circulation for some weks prior to the disorder and managed by the OCU. Given the sensitivities around race and culture it may have assisted if an &#039;off OCU&#039; SIO had conducted a &#039;review&#039; of the investigation into that alleged offence to display Force commitment to communities.
1,10632,2186,10596,This is done on the PSU returns that are completed by the PSU commander.
1,10633,2177,10568,There are Bronze/Silver tactical and strategic refreshers run by Public Order  Training throughout the year
1,10634,2159,10224,Firearms &amp; public order joint training
1,10635,2166,10592,There many lessons to learn in this area - intelligence should form SIlvers tactical plan
1,10636,2169,10570,The preperation of a joint training programe between MIU and Public Order Training could incorporate the critical issues around evidence gathering in Public Order situations to assist future events of this nature.
1,10637,2159,10224,Define the Ground Commander Firearms role deployable by Silver not Gold.
1,10638,2186,10602,Considering the staffing levels within out Press and Public Relations Department I think you did very well
1,10639,2166,10604,Agreed and staff should be volunteers who have been assessed as credible
1,10640,2174,10606,and having heli-telly working will mean that silver and gold can have a much better perspective on what is happening on the ground
1,10641,2155,10455,Air to ground pictures were not available to Silver at the crucial flashpoint - these would have immeasurably assited Silver in the overview &amp; informed deployments which could have controlled the disorder.
1,10642,2182,10595,increase of public order courses for ocu, force needs more trained to ensure resilience in times of crisis...presently not enought level 2 courses
1,10643,2169,10570,Pro-active strategic deployment of ANPR would add to the intelligence picture and assist the investigation process. Strategic points should be identified for dynamic ANPR deployment during the planning stages for any future Critical Incidents
1,10644,2166,10633,Yes - and do they test the right things - how about some Gold - Silver refershers?
1,10645,2171,10623,This is right. We need to hold a Gold &quot;Core Group&quot; where we can share everything and then bring in other key partners later.
1,10646,2174,10568,must avoind the &#039;usual suspects&#039; doing all the jobs - it resticts resilience and deskills those who are not part of the inner click of &#039;glory boys&#039;
1,10647,2163,10631,Yes agreed. -reality is that the rumour and identification that it waas a &#039;critical incident&#039; was only effectively known on the Tuesday before the disorder.
1,10648,2178,10572,Additional central support should be provided to an OCU planning team in large scale events such as this at the earliest opportunity. In this event too few staff were left planning the response too an event which had enormous potential to impact of the integrity of the force.
1,10649,2171,10631,An external SIO was appointed on the Tuasday to review the investigation but overall the point is well made - early invovlment of Crime Support is essential
1,10650,2177,10625,A cadre system for known events(football,cricket,carnivals, etc) and spontaneous incidents will provide the necessary competence and accreditation.
1,10651,2169,10570,Considerable development work is needed around video viewing facilities and our ability to retrieve and present digital CCTV evidence.
1,10652,2182,10606,use of f.i.ts (forward intelligence teams) not presently trained in WMP but are use extensively pre and during PO events in the Met
1,10653,2166,10381,Participation should not be optional or universal
1,10654,2159,10567,Numbers of Level 2 trained officers, EG and medics should be reviewed. IMHO there are insufficient to resource anything protracted.
1,10655,2172,10572,Communications
1,10656,2165,10635,Agreed but the decision about and the nature of the tactical plan is for a silver to make and not rely upon the intelligence function to do it for them. Intelligence will provide a silver with the threat and the assessment of risk attached to it and some suggested intervention opportunities but . the operational response must come from silver
1,10657,2182,10640,use of hand held heli telly like that utilised by the fou....for bronzes
1,10658,2155,10231,cadre cadre cadre  !!!- we need a cadre of force resources at all levels of command - appropriately trained &amp; accredited.  From RADs, to Tac Advisors to Bronze/Silvers.
1,10659,2174,10625,It seems bizarre that out of office hours the most senior officers on duty are currently acting inspectors for much of the force. This was a planned event and by no means spontaneous - had it been the response would have been dire.
1,10660,2183,10567,while the force need to look after its staff there is a need for staff and supervisors to think for themselves. You know you are going to be in a van for hours so plan to have emergency rations in your bag, serial sergeants use facilities open to the public for toilets get the van working as a team  prior to deployment so that when they are in the thick of it they gel... officers need to plan for themselves. to many officers except
1,10661,2159,10567,Inter Force aid - yes we are a big Force (and getting bigger) but it is not an admission of failure to request resources from elsewhere. We supplied to G8!
1,10662,2171,10572,Early declaration as Critical Incident is vital to trigger responses and resourcing.<br />A review of Critical Incident implemntation would provide useful learning.
1,10663,2186,10607,All events of this nature should be owned by HQ Operations, unfortunately force structure that has all the power based locally with OCU managers means that they do not want to give up ownership and prevents at important times like this the centre being able to dictate/mandate to OCUs and appropriate response.
1,10664,2162,10570,When firearms/Baton guns are deployed in public order there should be officers designated to deal with the multiple enquiries eg. 20 baton gun discharges. PIMS, Proffessional Standards for each.<br />Even the psni cannot deal with the number of baton gun discharges and a recent circular stated that out of 200 discharges over a two day period very few were able to be properly investigated due to the lack of resources.
2,10665,0,0,Messages to the Chief Constable
1,10666,2166,10615,The MIU have sufficient capacity and perhaps should assist by supporting EGTs and managing exhibits at the time - There will always be a need for additional support after a critical incident
1,10667,2183,10571,press office to link into switch board to ensure calls are not routed through commands of silver and gold
1,10668,2169,10608,All HQ Depts should have plans in place identifying skills of all personnel to fill crucial roles so that he burden of providing central resources is shared and &#039;normal business&#039;, albeit to a lesser extent, can be maintained by all
1,10669,2172,10655,Resilience of Airwave, is not the all singing and dancing we were probably led to expect. Is there a fall back position if Airwave falls down. Analogue radios: there is limited access on OCU&#039;s and Control Rooms systems do not link in...
1,10670,2174,10568,there needs to be clear understanding of what is expected of the support functions with gold and silver - tac ads, logistics, office managers etc. When we have that clear we need to train colleagues to properly perform the function.
1,10671,2166,10590,You have got far too much office estate as it is
1,10672,2183,10253,did any one brief the central switch board
1,10673,2177,10654,There are over 2,500 level 2 trained officers in this force. It&#039;s their distribution across OCU&#039;s and shft patterns that requires direction and management.
1,10674,2172,10655,Mobile Phones: if Airwave goes down so probably will mobile phones. Not suitable for public order deployment
1,10675,2182,10648,HQ ops could assist OCU planning teams in a consultancy role to advise around force/resourcing/planning issues....inc in HQ ops are OSU, FOU etc who were never consulted until the last possible moment
1,10676,2178,10605,Many F3 staff still feel threatened after the disorder. Force resources have left and returned to their own areas. Consideration should be given to the option for F3 staff to move around the force and for opportunities for staff from other OCU`s to taste the F3 experience. Op Strikeout provided good evidence that many officers fro across the force would like the opportunity to work in a demanding environment experienceing serious crime on a regular basis.
1,10677,2186,10648,Support would be useful but following the build up of community tension we should have had HQ Operations involved at a much earlier stage.
1,10678,2182,10669,review of airwave..does it work in the world of public order and fireams......we dont think they do!
1,10679,2170,10669,Quite often supervisors are asked to switch channels to monitor other situations however this impacts upon airwave and excessive use of a channel can cause it crash......or so we are lead to believe.
1,10680,2166,10625,The force has recently reviewed the structure and considered dedicated force out of hours supt cover for the force and decided not to proceed as I understand
1,10681,2172,10655,Review of Airwave system particularly handsets in wet weather which appeared to be very impactive on the quality and ability to communicate.
1,10682,2183,10665,good to see him in gold with the rest of the staff the times he went to briefing of officers could have been more this would have increased moral
1,10683,2159,10253,There needs to be a contingency plan that is mobilised by Silver but not dependent upon Silver having to prompt everything. Some sort of IT support for this would be appreciated.
1,10684,2163,10607,See previous comment about interference of F3 management in Force Strategic Plan. There is a lack of clarity here, over ownership and role between OCU and Force
1,10685,2155,10428,I agree DSO adds an additional tier of command which would slow down decision making  &amp; our response.  A public order commander on scene should have the appropriate ACPO authority to deploy baton guns against lethal (non firearms) riot - the firearms threat is a separate issue,  &amp; requires a firearms ground commander.
1,10686,2171,10567,I am not sure it is about the numbers of trained officers so much as their availability. We need to build in and then enforce minimum resource levels at any given time for all key roles. This needs to be proportionate to the threat/risk
1,10687,2165,10558,Force Intelligence provided the intelligence flow and process is adhered to.
1,10688,2159,10665,I know that the leter he sent to an OSU Inspector and his staff thanking them for their work on the night was very  much greatly appreciated.
1,10689,2177,10660,I think it&#039;s reasonable to expect at least one meal to be provided within a 17 hour tour of duty
1,10690,2182,10665,please review the use of the Airwave system
1,10691,2166,10665,The incident was managed well.  In a situation like this there will always be opportunities for learning - we have some.
1,10692,2170,10665,Review of the levels of recognition that is not consistent across all OCU&#039;s for staff that were deployed to the same incident.
1,10693,2171,10665,In many forces the Chief may not have been around at all.
1,10694,2171,10665,Thank you for dinner last night
1,10695,2153,10667,Shouldn&#039;t it be obvious to Switchboard not to route them through to silver/gold. In future the press office will attempt to let Switchboard know our statements but when the likelihood is that there is one or two press officers in handling hundreds of media calls, writing briefings and statements and trying to monitor media this would realistically be low on the list of priorities.
1,10696,2159,10665,As Silver the opportunity to speak to him in the early hours of Sunday was useful in order to convey what had happened and the good work that had been done by officers &amp; staff.
1,10697,2170,10688,It photocopied very well for 24 personal files!
1,10698,2174,10662,I think we have overcomplicated &#039;critical incident&#039; in this force which is why nobody uses it. ACPO needs to sign up to wanting to be a &#039;risk averse&#039; force - then drive forward the policy.
1,10699,2166,10665,The timimg of this de-brief was about right - sufficient time for people to reflect - it worked for me
1,10700,2183,10665,we managed the incident without the need for mutual aid. Other forces would not have been able o do this
1,10701,2155,10665,Insist on this debrief being followed up with vigour - pledge some resources to implementing the main recommedations that the Force develops from this process.
1,10702,2180,10694,WhAT DID YOU HAVE?
1,10703,2182,10665,Have your officers got the best possible public order equipment...No they havent
1,10704,2162,10254,Consider training the some of the OSU in Baton gun in public order tactics and may be AFO&#039;s thereby releasing a number of firearms officers required in disorders. They would then be available for core policing firearms roles and spin off investigations from the disorder.
1,10705,2178,10665,I would like to see the Chief Constable follow through on his commitment to review the force resilience in responding to such disorder. This debrief event is an excellent starter but I hope we act on the considered feedback ti improve things for the future.
1,10706,2163,10665,Overall Force dealt with incident remarkably well.  Always areas of learning, whic this debrief has achieved very well
1,10707,2175,10665,Overall the operation was a success and the force should be justifiably proud of that. However, the key learning points of the de-brief cannnot be ignored. It is vital that we are a force fit for purpose should the event occurr again and there needs to be investment in the issues raised to enable us to respond in a more profesional manner to anything. We have proved our worth with a number of major events this year and it would be great if we did it better on the next occasion.
1,10708,2153,10665,His interest in media issues and press office welfare was welcomed.
1,10709,2182,10694,pie and chips and a can of coke in his car
1,10710,2170,10665,You head a force that abides the best traditions of &#039;getting the job done when the chips are down!&#039;.
1,10711,2169,10665,He provided strong leadership at Gold meetings but was absent from officer briefings and media events
1,10712,2165,10665,Intelligence is the treasure of the ruler.... it must be adequately resourced to deliver
1,10713,2166,10703,But what we have is pretty good
1,10714,2155,10665,Need more OSU (please Sir)
1,10715,2159,10693,Thats why they are reducing the number of Forces.
1,10716,2178,10688,If this is true then I must say there were many other staff involved over the weekend of disorder that should expect such recognition.
1,10717,2174,10665,Dont be too distracted by the strategic force discussions, we still need to manage this outfit as well.
1,10718,2171,10665,I endorse views about Hydra as a debrief model. It has worked really effectively in allowing everyone a real say without some of the vulnerabilities that open and honest feedback can raise.
1,10719,2172,10665,With the exception of the DCC&#039;s effective briefing message,there was no obvious sign of ACPO rank outside of Gold Control.<br />There might have been benefit for staff at briefing  and subsequently refreshment areas to see some one of rank higher than usually a Ch. Insp.
1,10720,2163,10665,Resist temptation to jump in and lead the &#039;recovery plan&#039; within the community. This was not disorder about policing or authority and although a key stakeholder we should not lead the recovery. That is for others
1,10721,2181,10665,Overall Op Javari was a sucess and the majority of staff know this. However there are serious issues raised by this debrief that need to be addressed. Once resolved all staff need to know that things have been taken seriously and that maybe the same mistakes will not be made again.
1,10722,2166,10602,The press office did a very good job in supporting the force
1,10723,2170,10665,Operations Department is under rated and under resoursed. Every OCU benefits and for the sake of loosing minimal staff, departments such as OSU, Dogs can expend and deliver an even better service to the force area and beyond
1,10724,2159,10692,That applies at all levels - senior colleagues may be in the invidious position of awarding themselves something - should be some central recognition.
1,10725,2169,10665,Rather than waiting until the next vent that we have to, once again, rely on individual commitment and good will, please consider resourcing of cenral departments and make them fit for purpose
1,10726,2183,10665,there are many people who worked behind the scenes that would benifit from a word of thanks at the end of the year this has been a heavy year on the force with general elections g8 terroism, handsworth, fire strike, and also the inprovement in the performance of the force.
1,10727,2182,10714,Your OSU are now to specialist..cbrn moe,level 1 anti terror searches etc..there is a reluctance to use them IN CASE THEY ARE NEEDED ELSE WHERE...it needs to be reviewed
1,10728,2158,10665,CC and all senior management very supportive in allowing the post crime/disorder investigation to progress in a methodical manner without any pressure for quick results - much appreciated
1,10729,2178,10714,Please implement a tenure policy for OSU sgts
1,10730,2159,10692,The OSU in insufficient in size to effectively support the Force in the event of major disorder.
1,10731,2180,10694,tWO MANY OF YOUR SENIOR OFFICERS CARN&#039;T SPELL!
1,10732,2153,10665,Can the press office have some more press officers so they can effectively staff the office 24/7 for major incidents?
1,10733,2174,10718,Agreed again, the more use we make of opportunities to debrief the better - but is there a commitment to learn from debriefing.
1,10734,2165,10665,We need to make sure that we know what we know in terms of information and intelligence and once we know what we know take the high ground
1,10735,2167,10719,The Chief made several visits to the refreshment area and ate the meal!!
1,10736,2170,10703,Too much emphasis on visibility. No one wanted hi vis jackets in disorder...but this was insisted upon. Corporate image has its place but maybe not during a riot.......it did look good on the telly.
1,10737,2175,10665,In the true sense of the role of gold, the gold group meeting always defered to the chief when he present in the room...great testement to his leadership, but created confusion of command. Great to see the leader present, but the confusion of leadership  needs to be considered
1,10738,2155,10665,Structure  Gold so there is no doubt if asked the question about &#039;who is in charge of this incident?&#039;
1,10739,2166,10665,The Command Team did a good job - we all worked hard and there are lessons to be learned at every level
1,10740,2171,10665,Need to hold the Council to account now. If they see this as a one off public order issue and therefore a police matter, they will fail to adddress some serious long term tensions between the black and asian communities. There is still a reluctance by local politiciians to really acknoweldge that there are very strong feelings/rivalries between these two communities. I think the dosirder of that weekend frightened people ,that and good policing quelled. We may not be so fortunate next time.
1,10741,2159,10729,They should already be subject to management review.
1,10742,2170,10729,Set at 30 years!!!!
1,10743,2174,10726,bless
1,10744,2173,10666,The MIU were set up following a business case around murder investigation. The investigation of disorders on this scale takes this role into a new area.  The support from OCU&#039;s has been superb and we now need to look at how we would cope the next time.  I agree that the MIU should be involved from an early stage with guidance and support around EGT&#039;s and obtaining of exhibits
1,10745,2182,10714,gold training for your acpo officers except Dave Shaw..who did very well
1,10746,2170,10726,WELL DONE
1,10747,2186,10665,Sir, the force managed to maitnain its performance throughout a testing few days, please review the forces and OCUs commitment to training to allow us to keep this up.
1,10748,2183,10665,thanks to the acc&#039;s who worked long nights for over a week, and designed a new look at like desciption of people ah Antonio Bandero
1,10749,2165,10665,Force of a thousand macs?
1,10750,2159,10729,Paris disorder happened post Javari - the potential for the next disorder would be some copycatting. That would significantly affect our policing of it.
1,10751,2169,10717,Conflicting personal agendas of ACCs is holding the Force back
1,10752,2178,10665,Sir please ensure that we have appropriately trained staff that are able to be deployed to public order scenarios where firearms are involved
1,10753,2186,10665,Get ACC shaw to tell you his chicken tikka gag!!
1,10754,2177,10749,Supervisors of all ranks have a  responsibility!!!
1,10755,2170,10749,No corporacy in stab vest covers...needs to be addressed
1,10756,2183,10665,please get the helicopter down link repaired in gold it is one of those problems that keeps rolling on and on because no one will find the money but we need those pictures
1,10757,2170,10665,Buy this debriefing tool and use it. It generates open and healthy debate without any fear.
1,10758,2183,10572,The debrief from the G8 event has been sent back to force this is a glowing report some of these lessons need to be included in future events ..............
1,10759,2173,10671,i agree but no harm in trying!
1,10760,2159,10447,Different Bonus Panels meet at different times - it is being looked at.
1,10761,2182,10713,have a look at our regional cousins you will see we are outdated
1,10762,2183,10665,Sir<br />Use the Media to tell people how good we are, other forces use the press for less that we do so lets shout about it.

1,10791,2262,10763,used interactive miltechno in driver pursuit and roadcraft training sessions.  Used blended elearning, workbook and workshop sessions
1,10792,2255,10763,finished it as quickly as possible
1,10793,2249,10763,split training between class and pdu
1,10794,2244,10763,Recommendation 61 training.
1,10795,2246,10763,used it to deliver virtual classes across the globe (multiple time zones)
1,10796,2257,10763,proving that pre learning has been undertaken and understood
1,10797,2242,10763,created a cd e-learning package for 6000 multi-agency workers.
1,10798,2219,10785,how did you learn to do that
1,10799,2258,10784,how?
1,10800,2257,10764,Highest level support..ACPO before you start
1,10801,2245,10768,the learner must be supported if they are to use this learning effectively
1,10802,2254,10775,the overall aim and most important bit
1,10803,2247,10777,We must not forget the IT skills of new joiners. Will we need to train to use the system - NO. The system should be THAT simple.
1,10804,2258,10764,Has to be a visable proactive from chief officers.
1,10805,2249,10767,you must be realistic about the age and capabilities of force it systems, firewalls, restrictions, age of software. If you are picky about hardware requirements you need to fund
1,10806,2257,10766,Marketing intenally and externally (partners and community)
1,10807,2255,10775,Competent to do what, use IT or police?
1,10808,2251,10770,Must be achievable and realistic and comply with the national requirements - not simply local (not saying local standards are not good enough)
1,10809,2263,10776,Content must be up to date, relevant.  Appropriate quality assurance processes need to be in place, especially if individual Forces are uploading content.
1,10810,2241,10771,the ability to do just in time learning at the time and point of need.
1,10811,2245,10800,There is an ACPO e learning group if your ACPO team care to listen to them
1,10812,2259,10770,Professionalising the police service - needs to map to NOS, qualifications etc
1,10813,2244,10777,The system needs to be accessible from forcewide computers without the need to enter secondary passwords to access the learning.
1,10814,2262,10767,With the rapid development of IT and associated software it is vital that a hardware platform is selected to be as future proof as possible.
1,10815,2248,10777,Straightforward menus (minumum keystrokes).<br />Also simple to register courses (both self register and bulk register)
1,10816,2259,10770,Must meed needs of the force - mission vision values etc
1,10817,2242,10770,who will maintain the standards of the product?
1,10818,2256,10770,a standard is a minimum requirement but must be achievable<br />How are they set?
1,10819,2243,10764,What about creating outr own courses
1,10820,2247,10773,Who will be responsible for continuing environmental scanning.
1,10821,2241,10771,size of chunks commensurate with attention span.
1,10822,2254,10777,needs to be simple and basic for operational staff
1,10823,2263,10779,Appropriately located hardware, in a safe learning environment.  Users to be provided with protected learning time.
1,10824,2244,10773,Whilst content should be reusable, it is necessary to quality control and version control content to ensure it retains currency
1,10825,2245,10775,Dont officers have to be competant to use IT in order to police?
1,10826,2254,10807,to police
1,10827,2249,10768,Time away from operational tasks to complete e-learning packages - protected study policy
1,10828,2246,10764,buy in at all levels of the organisation - strategic down to individual learner and changing the learning culture
1,10829,2242,10772,What skills are required for creative input eg design
1,10830,2251,10764,Must emcompass sufficient funding and competent Managers and Administrators
1,10831,2258,10772,Encourage out of the box thinking and maintain interest
1,10832,2255,10776,At the moment it&#039;s all about Performance and how quickly can we do it!<br />We need  officers to be  able to do quality work rather than just going from job to job, quickly as possible
1,10833,2257,10765,by a combination of consultation and good practice...not so big it becomes unwieldy and intimidating to the users
1,10834,2247,10774,Again, who will be responsible for updating DYNAMICALLY any material - must be up to date.
1,10835,2241,10775,officers working in a knowledge aware environment where they can learn, collaborate and act.
1,10836,2262,10772,When something is absorbing and fun to do, learning is often a by-product.
1,10837,2246,10768,system must be learner centred and intuititive to navigate
1,10838,2259,10775,Competant in what my force needs...citizen focused
1,10839,2256,10764,Where are the extra resources to make this happen?<br />What the start up costs? Have they been scoped?
1,10840,2242,10779,ease of access on to system in a logical, easy method. Refer to earlier session !!
1,10841,2241,10777,Intuitive, immersive and outcome driven.
1,10842,2248,10768,How will it cater for prior learning ...?
1,10843,2255,10801,Agree
1,10844,2263,10774,hard to use a product when it is not available and money has been spent producing our own product in lieu of.
1,10845,2246,10768,learner motivation to engage in the learning
1,10846,2257,10767,The minimum spec machines should be catered for not the spec of the training driving the hardware upgrade process... budgets
1,10847,2253,10774,Method for automatic communication of updates
1,10848,2262,10770,The monitoring of standards will be far easier in the MLE
1,10849,2249,10776,the system must not allow someone to just click through the learning.  knowledge checks must be dynamic to prevent lists of answers being circulated.
1,10850,2244,10767,It should be accessible from a variety of sources including the internet so that learners can work from home, libraries etc.
1,10851,2257,10768,make the mle interface much more intuitive please
1,10852,2246,10776,measureable outcomes (performance improvement)
1,10853,2254,10778,to provide useful information to forces at no cost
1,10854,2242,10777,The system is not logical to navigate uses wil be put off.
1,10855,2259,10807,Is there a miss-match between what the home office, our forces, and the public want?
2,10856,0,0,What would you like the future for NCALT to look like in three years time?
1,10857,2253,10770,What will sanctions be for non-compliance with any national standards?
1,10858,2257,10770,Integrate evaluation at the outset of the training design
1,10859,2244,10851,agree, the current interface is often counter intuitive
1,10860,2246,10778,need to be able to retrieve useful data for reporting and planning
1,10861,2251,10856,How did you add another major category during the exercise?
1,10862,2245,10773,Content that is reusable for other members of the wider policing family
1,10863,2256,10774,There is always a time lag from centre to training and from training to learners.  How can this be reduced and managed?
1,10864,2261,10770,Why is there no IT literacy assessment for the recruitment assessment centres
1,10865,2247,10856,SIMPLE!
1,10866,2244,10768,Agree the current interface is one of the biggest obstacles holding back the use of NCALT.
1,10867,2245,10856,Part of the organisational delivery tools of my Force
1,10868,2259,10769,Need to be able to pick and mix content from one course and use it for another...avoid duplication of  content
1,10869,2262,10856,Much easier to navigate and more interactive.
1,10870,2249,10768,How does answering one out of four alternatives demonstrate high order learning skills, evidencing the students ability to rationalise the question - why did I do what I did?
1,10871,2255,10856,easier access. Materials that era easy to use together. More single documents instead of 100, s of doc as they are now
1,10872,2258,10856,Complete buy in from all forces.  A bank of resources provided for all to share.  Improved collaboration.
1,10873,2247,10856,Ask again whenwe know the results of the amalgamation process!!!
1,10874,2251,10861,Delivery of this great inter-active system to all Forces at no cost!
1,10875,2259,10856,Seen as business as usual in force<br />Ties into formal qualifications<br />Poeple don&#039;t feel remote doing e-learning
1,10876,2243,10778,do other forces take into account DPA issues when reporting?, if yes, what issues have you come across?
1,10877,2249,10764,This needs to be more strongly pushed at higher levels.  IT managers, acpo etc.  At this time it can be seen as just another training manager &quot;want&quot;.
1,10878,2242,10856,A site that the user can use and navigate with ease. at present if this was a companies website it wouldn&#039;t be re-visited.
1,10879,2253,10778,Need to have real flexibility in reporting, as well as standard, suggested reports.
1,10880,2244,10856,The biggest issue for using ncalt within ipldp will be access to computer hardware for a large number of learners.    Finance needs to be commited to persoanl access, perhaps via PDA for all staff
1,10881,2253,10778,Who will own the data?
1,10882,2261,10765,Assistance with range of software authoring tools and training of - would be extremely usefull.
1,10883,2257,10856,that by demand of the users it has become a world class effective, credible and admired tool to improve the performance of the organisation nationally
1,10884,2258,10767,Can we change this category to IT INFRASTRUCTURE as it does not cover everything?
1,10885,2244,10856,There needs to be access to an  on-line portfolio to evidence NOS.
1,10886,2253,10766,Clearer, more collaborative communication from both Centrex and NCALT together.
1,10887,2245,10771,granularity in learning content
1,10888,2256,10775,Workforce modernisation will focus the minds of everyone if they are paid based on their level of competence?<br />Need for robust assessment by A1 assessors?<br />Even though there are A1 assessment standards, competence will look different to different forces and assessors
1,10889,2249,10778,Information must be easy to retrieve, and be flexible  in what can be retrieved. Also should be exportable into other systems(excel).
1,10890,2246,10856,Centrex to provide trainers with the skills to fully implement the blended learning approach
1,10891,2243,10777,Navigation is a big issue for our forces, what in particular do people think is the most complex and confusing areas - especially in regards to navigation (what can&#039;y we do?)
1,10892,2249,10778,Are individuals able to retrieve and print off proof of completion of subjects?
1,10893,2250,10856,How about what would we like the MLE to look like in three years
1,10894,2258,10779,Not everyone has access to internet?
1,10895,2245,10856,Implement the LCMS to allow for learning objects to be dynamically created by learners
1,10896,2248,10854,Agreed, I am an IT developer, admitedly I have only logged into the system today, but I did not find the screens and menus very intuitive ... so I do wonder what the training/familiarity overhead will be for a standard learner.   The learner should be able to log in and be able to get on with the learning rather than spending time learning how to get to the training material.
1,10897,2241,10856,The USS Enterprise - holo deck
1,10898,2259,10856,I sign on in force and don&#039;t have to sign on seperatly for NCALT
1,10899,2258,10779,Not all have access to a Workstation
1,10900,2249,10768,Can data from the SEARCH assessment be brought over to the learners record, to identify possiblem learning needs and to populate diversity data fields.
1,10901,2247,10890,The use of a blended learning environment should become part of the TDP (sorry - it may already be there but marketted differently!)
1,10902,2245,10778,Not repeat what Force systems do
1,10903,2244,10856,The NCALT website should look to large companies and organisations that are selling products to see how user friendly they are. If the current product was trying to make a profit the company would probably go bust, it just does not attract, and people will not stick with it.
1,10904,2256,10771,IPLDP is too large, complex and difficult to implement???<br />22 NOS is too many to address in 2 years -a NOS too far.<br />Prison Service is 5 NOS?
1,10905,2250,10856,Go Commercial as well as public sector
1,10906,2245,10765,Increased functionality to meet force needs as they develop
1,10907,2245,10856,list of projects in progress
1,10908,2256,10775,COMPETENCE SHOULD NOT BE TIME BOUND

1,11006,2325,10997,please can you explain the enjoyment aspect for us
1,11007,2315,10983,is it not ok to lose?
1,11008,2318,11000,You need to be clear on what your own values are before you start
1,11009,2310,10990,you can only secure real confidence when there is honesty, integrity and above all action within your response
1,11010,2299,10992,Important that all actions are conducted within a legal framework and are ECHR compliant
1,11011,2297,11002,Required from everyone involved
1,11012,2311,10995,I assume that this will be linked with learning.
1,11013,2316,10984,I think that justice is about living in right relationships.
1,11014,2326,11000,Whose morality- one mans meat is another mans poison.
1,11015,2293,10991,Can learning as an outcome be a excuse for failure in the event and is this acceptable.
1,11016,2324,11003,to recognise needs and identify solutions
1,11017,2323,10991,good point- circumstances alter cases
1,11018,2320,11003,providing support and care to victims and witnesses
1,11019,2329,10999,Love comes in many shapes and sizes, often it is unconditional like with a child and sometimes it can be a very costly emotion
1,11020,2318,10987,Ideally, but you need to recognise that some things will not be closed for some people - and this may not be failure
1,11021,2299,11000,It is also important that the vales of the organisation are clearly stated and adhered to
1,11022,2310,10996,all the communication amounts to hot air without integrity within what you say and do
1,11023,2326,10991,learn to become that which you are not
1,11024,2316,10986,Peace is balance - within oneself, between people and with all of creation.
1,11025,2308,10994,We must consider the impact of our actions on the public when planning/dealing with and learning from the out come of any critical incident
1,11026,2309,10992,a cornerstone of delivering justice. How do we maimise the opportunity to ensure that what we do is right, and minimise challenge.
1,11027,2314,10984,Where does the orgonisation sit within the justice path. Are we the start or the end? We are the start of the conveyer belt but we do not engage fully with others on the conveyer belt. Thus we have little control of the product at the end.
1,11028,2325,10991,in order to learn all intrested parties need to be involved
1,11029,2311,10991,It is essential that out of all critical incidents we have a process that assists the organisation learn and not just those involved in the incident
1,11030,2315,11005,this doesn&#039;t mean protecting the organisation it may mean openness about being wrong and showing how you are going to learn
1,11031,2324,10994,Real beings affected by behaviour of others
1,11032,2328,11005,This triggers all sorts of thinking about organisational health. Well woman clinics for example as a metaphor for thinking about how organisations might take a health audit across a range of diagnostic tools.
1,11033,2318,10988,The world we live is often not clear - different peoples perspectives are just as real for them
1,11034,2315,10986,work and family
1,11035,2313,10993,It was Einstien that said Common Sense is the accumulation of all our prejudices by the time we reach 19 years of age....
1,11036,2294,10993,often in dealing with issues we lose sight of what can be achieved and forget to retain that common sense approach....expectations are often not realistic!
1,11037,2297,11005,The definition of this and how you measure it - What does it look like and what does success look like ? - will vary with different people&#039;s perspectives and previous experience of the organisation
1,11038,2319,10989,Is there a presumption here that there is a common understanding and common goals within the organisation? In order to have true purpose there has to be effective leadership.
1,11039,2301,11000,whatever peoples&#039; race, religion, beliefs there is surely a common morality or respect for others that should enable a more harmonious society.
1,11040,2309,10994,both inside and outside the organisation
1,11041,2310,10994,in large organisations it is easy to become inward looking and to forget the real human issues, particularly when it relates to internal issues. It is people that matter in what we do.
1,11042,2323,10994,not often clear cut who the victim is - eg with grievances , both sies often feel the victim
1,11043,2302,10985,Unfortunately this can be one of the driving forces against all the other elements listed when dealing with critical incidents.
1,11044,2326,10987,By closing down do you stop yourself from growing?
1,11045,2303,10990,So much of what we do is dependent upon the community having confidence in our ability and professionalism. If this is lost we struggle to deliver our service. We need the confidence of our staff and communities to be effective. Therefore the response to all incidents ad issues should seek to maintain and build this confidence to make us effective.
1,11046,2308,10998,Learn to take a deep breath and consider the  impact of any course of action before hitting the send button
1,11047,2324,10992,lack of a burden of proof can prejudice outcome
1,11048,2329,11001,How do we show respect to each other when you can&#039;t measure it. It can mean one thing to you and one thing to me. Treat others how you want to be treated.
1,11049,2297,10994,The organisation can also be a victim
1,11050,2296,11005,Organisational well-being is something to be considered at all stages of the process. However does this sometimes conflict with honesty and transparency if an initial goal is the organisational well-being?
1,11051,2328,11007,Sometimes, as Robert Mark once said, you can only win by appearing to lose. Sometimes you actually have to lose.
1,11052,2299,10998,This is both internal and external - we must be tolerant of the views and limitiaions of or staff and of the external perspective - we do not have all the correct answers
1,11053,2314,10986,work life balance - we sometimes expect to much of our staff
1,11054,2324,10993,equitable and fairness
1,11055,2326,11005,which organisation?
1,11056,2318,10985,Should we protect the finances of the organistaion/public - if we have made  mistakes and the morally correct posiition would be to admit liability but have large financial implications?
1,11057,2316,10993,it seems to me that &#039;professionalism&#039; sometimes stifles common sense. A person can become so programmed and technical that they lose touch with their instincts and fail to use a bit of common sense.
1,11058,2307,11004,Involvement of support networks to enhance investigations and reach individual and group perspectives that are often absent from police teams
1,11059,2309,10986,work life balance
1,11060,2319,10998,See &#039;respect&#039; - without it you can&#039;t achieve this.
1,11061,2315,10991,having theopportunity to apply learning to ouwn role
1,11062,2292,10987,this is really important in a number of ways - personal closure for the individuals involved; closure for the organisation; closure in the minds of the public.  But closure does not necessarily last; as long as people remember an incident it has the potential of flaring up again or inflaming responses to other situations.
1,11063,2311,10990,This issue is intrinsically linked with honesty, integrity and training/learning. It is not just confidence in our ability to deal with incidents but the publics confidence in us to deal and learn that matters
1,11064,2308,10983,Is there ever a win win, if we are dealing with a contingency something that was avoidable has already happened
1,11065,2325,11004,all staff represevtative bodies should be involved where possible
1,11066,2314,10991,Do we truly allow others to make genuine mistakes and support them and develop them?
1,11067,2293,10983,Can win win ever actually be achieved or is this really loose loose as it is compromise that may be to save face and not be the right outcome<br />is a win so important
1,11068,2306,10998,I&#039;m not always sure about tolerance. Tolerance of the intolerable?<br />To tolerate someone or some group is not the same as embracing their difference or diversity.
1,11069,2310,10990,if you are confident in what you are doing then it will encourage others to be confident in your course of action. Provided it is not arrogance.
1,11070,2307,10992,Just because we have the power does not mean that we have to use it
1,11071,2318,10986,Do all values have the same &#039;weight&#039;?
1,11072,2298,10989,I feel that this is the critical area. A clear purpose, which takes into account many of the other features of respect, gives the opportunity to provide clear internal and external messages.
1,11073,2294,10995,prevention of things becoming critical incidents hinges on early and apropriate intervention
1,11074,2312,10996,actions should be justified and logical in order that they can be followed through when challenged
1,11075,2324,10990,of paramount interest to to maintain integrity
1,11076,2305,10993,a rarity
1,11077,2326,10990,Confidence inspires trust that inturn enables people to engage and makes us collectivly the richer.
1,11078,2309,10988,Seeking clarification to maximise effort to deliver organisational and personal goals
1,11079,2313,11007,I think what is meant here is that both sides need to FEEL that they have achieved a result in their favour
1,11080,2293,10986,we may strive but do we ever underantand what balance is - is this not an issue of personal persepctive an aspiration we never achieve
1,11081,2328,11004,Supporting individuals involved in all the complexity of an internal critical incident and supporting the organisation.
1,11082,2297,10987,Closure means allowing all involved to find a place where they can move on from and flourish.  It does not mean failing to learn or change
1,11083,2299,10991,Too often we state we are wiling to provide people with the space to make mistakes and learn when in practice this is not the case and scapegoats are made to potect others reputations
1,11084,2303,10986,Balance is about trying to walk a path of accepting and respecting the needs of individuals and groups , demonsrating this and taking it into account whilst seeing a resolution that is suitable, effective and acceptable. Relationship and communication will assist in achieving this and the understanding to underpin it .
1,11085,2292,10985,sometimes throwing money at a situation is not the answer.  Free spending on one incident can cause resentment amongst people who feel they are under-resourced elsewhere.
1,11086,2302,10994,Sometimes people are forgotten about both internally and externally when a critical incident has occurred.  Considerations such as litigation, reputation, money, self preservation (damaged to career) and organisational well being have an over-riding influence on decisions made.  Those decisions can sometimes be made without a thought for people.
1,11087,2296,10983,I assume this relates to a more loose interpretation. ie sometimes to lose but learn in the process is a win?
1,11088,2314,10999,Organisations do not love - they just are.
1,11089,2311,10994,It is essential that from a very early stage we identify those involved and if they are a victim. This will assist in obtaining a win win and provide us with the basis for our strategy to deal with the incident
1,11090,2324,10985,money cannot buy or restore confidence
1,11091,2301,10998,ideally we would all be tolerant but that assumes others acting responsibly, not taking advantage of tolerance
1,11092,2323,10987,need to help people move on sometimes  - cant change the past but some people find that difficult to accept
1,11093,2293,10987,the ability to undertake closure should be valued - it is hard to achieve given human traits
1,11094,2305,10991,never to old to learn
1,11095,2319,11001,It&#039;s about valuing difference; being prepared to learn. It isn&#039;t about measurement. You might not be able to describe the elephant, but you know it when you see it.
1,11096,2299,11050,No the well being depends on s being open and honest - if we are not we will suffer long term
1,11097,2307,10984,It is the primary measure of how effective the service as been, it is indicative of the value we place on certain incidents
1,11098,2315,11050,organisational WB isn&#039;t about being judged for what you are - you could be bad.  It should be looked at from the perspective of what you are prepared to admit and what you are going to do about it.
1,11099,2308,10995,Prevention is linked to learning from previous experience and then changing your approach no matter how painful the process is.
1,11100,2312,10983,sometimes someone is actually wrong
1,11101,2326,10997,enjoying something is a releasing anabling thing, you release more passion and energy if you are enjoying it.
1,11102,2314,10985,Critical incidents by their very nature need to be dealt with speddily and effectively - money should not come into it.
1,11103,2318,10990,Sometimes maintaining the confidence in individuals or organisations is more important than on other occasions. The belief and confidence that the Justice system is fair is  and just is more important than the the confidence that there are no &#039;back handers; in Premiership Football for example.
1,11104,2329,10994,Treat each victim as you would the other. People will include everyone involved in the incident from staff to passers by.
1,11105,2311,11002,In all critical incidents we need to be aware of other organisations roles and powers i.e. IPCC
1,11106,2297,10995,Its good to talk - identify risks and failings, then put them right
1,11107,2309,10989,Clarity of purpose will assist all to feel comfortable and rewarded in what they do
1,11108,2302,10991,Do we really learn from past incidents?  We conduct debriefs and then the valuable information gleaned tends to be forgotten because we move on and time is a great healer.
1,11109,2300,10996,Given that critical incidents are by definition &#039;important&#039; events in the lives of people and organisations it is fundamental that we do the right thing. Without integrity we have no respect and no lawful mandate. Integrity protects our intentions.
1,11110,2295,10984,For me, justice as a concept is critical to how we should live and needs to be a core shared value. I beleive we are here to do everything we can to prevent bad things happening to good people. We can loose sight of this value or principle because we&#039;re part of a crimial &#039;justice&#039; system.
1,11111,2320,10995,It is important to reflect on critical incidents, examine the causes and try to put systems in place to prevent them from happening again
1,11112,2321,10996,once you have agreed and support a particular framework of behaviour you should try to stand by it in all circumstances. this  of course can be extremely difficult. This framework should encompass respect for others, compassion and fairness.<br />You should openly articulate what you consider to be this acceptable behaviour so others can challenge it so you do not exist in a &#039;moral vacuum&#039; and can ensure your framework is valid.
1,11113,2298,10991,It is crucial that there are mechanisms to allow and apply learning as our understanding of a critical incident evolves as well as debrief stage.
1,11114,2310,11002,there are many times when real transparency in a situation would create public panic or concern. Honesty can exist in what you say but it may not be really transparent, more opaque.
1,11115,2325,10993,throw in discression as well it has been depleted recently
1,11116,2324,10983,To lose may also mean win in he long run having accepted failures in the first place
1,11117,2293,10996,the essence of what makes a person just that to be valued and savoured
1,11118,2315,11002,not everyone is honest how do you overcome that
1,11119,2326,10983,a win win may never be absolute but its a valuable aspiration
1,11120,2305,10995,is better than the cure
1,11121,2323,10984,for some people justice may be abot vengeanc - need to take care what justice means
1,11122,2317,10995,We need to align our workforce and create an internal and customer facing, inclusive ethos, culture and access which will mean that the organisation is truly accessible and open, inspiring confidence at all levels internally and externally. We will do this by prioritising and monitoring our performance in this regard, by having such values permeate our recruitment, training and employment and behavioural practices and by continuing to develop effective partnerships and neighbourhood policing which is genuinely responsive to(and even anticipatory of) local needs.
1,11123,2307,10991,We do a lot of training but very little learning even though our history is littered with valuable examples
1,11124,2328,10984,This heading brings in Human Rights, Proportionate, Legal, Accountable, Necessary,  acting on the best information. Normally applied to all the individuals but equally applicable to the organisation as a whole.
1,11125,2324,11001,treat others in the manner you would wish to be treated
1,11126,2311,10992,It is not just our organisation that has powers to deal with or be included in incidents i.e. IPCC
1,11127,2310,11003,it is at times of pressure that we all show clear commitment, the real test is in the before and the after
1,11128,2292,10991,Learning is often an objective but not supported by processes and resources to enable it to happen and measurements to evaluate the success of the learning.  All these need to be in place for the learning to truly stick.
1,11129,2303,10994,People can be fantastic and they can be difficult , demaqnding and self focused but they usuallythe centre of and the key to issues that need to be dealt with. Dialogue , involvement and receptieness will go some distance to creating co operation and buy in to seeking a way forward
1,11130,2306,11002,If you are really honest can you,as police officers, really be completley transparent about everything? Are you at liberty to be? Aren&#039;t there osme things which you can&#039;t be transparent about?<br />So is is actually dishonest to say you will be transparent?
1,11131,2329,11002,Need to be open honest and transparent which is the key to a successful operation.
1,11132,2314,10997,You are only here once - do something you enjoy or move on
1,11133,2313,10985,My view on this is not necessarily about the compensation issue but the tremendous drain on resources that occurs when such incidents reach the litigous stage.
1,11134,2300,11006,you get paid the same whether you are enjoying yourself or being miserable. Whilst you are at it, you might as well be enjoying yourself.
1,11135,2318,10991,The organisation needs to allow people to learn but on occasion mistakes are of such importance that the need to punish or dismiss outweighs the need to leran for individuals but not for organisations
1,11136,2316,10999,one of the lessons of history is that love will ultimately prevail.
1,11137,2311,10999,Could/would cause problems in critical incidents
1,11138,2309,10991,How do we capture learning in manageable forms so that is available to the appropriate people to maximise the chance of future success.
1,11139,2297,11004,Support is required for ALL involved
1,11140,2326,10999,If love is the ultimate motivator the outcome is more likely to be positive
1,11141,2299,11001,We often have to narrow a perspective on respect - it is about valuing difference - but how many managers really do that. If people are not in the standard organisational mould it is rare they will proceed, this causes them to fit the mould, just like in the poem, creativitly is lost
1,11142,2294,11002,often lacking inhow we deal with critical incidents.Motives are assumed and atributed on little or no evidence.Wihout that honesty, positions become entrenched and resolution is made more difficult
1,11143,2298,10988,Is a lack of clarity an acceptable approach as a holding pattern whilst we gain an understanding of the issues
1,11144,2324,10994,the REAL victims are often hidden beyond the organisation, ie dependents
1,11145,2295,10985,If we were able to operate at all times with, honesty, integrity and the full confidence of the community - we wouldn&#039;t be discussing money at all - would we?
1,11146,2315,10991,Is part of the learning not reflecting on what we have learnt in the past and identifying how it has contibuted/influenced in the present?  ie are our methods effective in changing behaviours?
1,11147,2296,11001,Respect is a word that is used on alot of occassions. How do we ensure we deliver on this, yet still achieve our goals of resolving the incident ,where the incident by its nature may put us in conflict with this.
1,11148,2293,10985,a necessity in life and work that so dominates and so destroys our values and beliefs in what is right and persepctive We justify our actions without being honest about the drivers
1,11149,2311,11014,What about the female gender?
1,11150,2318,10997,Even when dealing with tragic or unpleasant issues there are opportunities to enjoy some aspects of what you are doing (especialy the team work involved)- otherwise you would go mad
1,11151,2319,10988,Don&#039;t see how you can hope to embrace integrity without some focus on clarity: if only clarity of purpose, organisational direction and expectations. Too often frustration is caused and mistakes made because the starting position and anticipated outcomes were not clear.
1,11152,2301,11003,it,s essential to show a general commitment to all we do. If a job,s worth doing etc.
1,11153,2309,11003,should not be measured in terms of hours spent in the work environment
1,11154,2329,10997,You don&#039;t have to treat critical incidents as a &#039;panic button&#039; but take it stage by stage and you will enjoy the end result if you have applied all the principles of handling critical incidents
1,11155,2310,10995,to be a true learning organisation we must be in a position to challenge, to accept that challenge but also to be given freedom to question. In that way prevention can be achieved.
1,11156,2324,10984,is it punishment or is it putting right all the wrongs
1,11157,2308,11001,Respect also means respecting and listening the views of those within your organisation and the wider community who have expertise in dealing with different aspects of incident management. Rank does not always mean that you are right.
1,11158,2302,10986,What does this mean?  What are we trying to balance?
1,11159,2300,10991,General practice seems to dictate that we only learn from the error not the success. &#039;Learning&#039; has become an urban myth and we have perhaps forgotten what we mean by the word.
1,11160,2293,10995,prevention too often comes as a result of a consequence rather than prevention as an action in it&#039;s own right
1,11161,2326,10988,precision is vital to enable you to focus on solving the critical problem without it you may simply spin the problem into an even bigger one&gt;
1,11162,2315,10985,Should money influence us in being prepared to doing the right thing?
1,11163,2292,11104,consistency in the respect with which we treat each victim but recognition of their individuality - which may mean that we don&#039;t treat each victim as we would the other.
1,11164,2303,10985,All resources are finite. Often the point where morality and higher issues meet the challenge of resource is where pragmatism comes forward to bring options for an outcome. The possible solutions are the ones we can deliver, they are the context of decision making.
1,11165,2321,10986,All our responses should be balanced and proportionate and we should continually challenge our decisions and ensure that are not based on prejudice or bias but upon the real nature of a situation
1,11166,2320,11005,Being professional is probably the best way to consider the organisational well bieng
1,11167,2323,11139,sometimes forgotten if only one side seen as victim ?
1,11168,2301,10991,Far too little emphasis is placed on learning by by experience.
1,11169,2328,11027,Investigations are sometimes argued to be about information flow, inforation, actions raised, more information . . . . this constructs a narrative from which all else flows even if we have no direct control over the rest of the CJS.
1,11170,2298,10984,As an organisation we search for the truth and then submit the results of our endeavours to an adversarial system, court, public enquiry..
1,11171,2324,10989,to recognise alleged failures, educate, prevent and gain integrity from internal and external audience
1,11172,2311,11005,In seting our strategy to deal we must be clear on what outcomes will be acceptable
1,11173,2310,11004,individuals join to support the organisation in a critical incident, but does the organisation do the same?
1,11174,2307,10991,We are accomplished when it comes to technical learning (how to use a firearm) but emotional intelligence skills that determine the situational response are less developed and they may prevent innocent members of the public being shot
1,11175,2319,10991,Is personal growth an organisational aim or an individual imperative? Isn&#039;t it time people started taking a little more responsibility for their own learning as well as their own application of that learning?
1,11176,2318,10998,How do we balance our own values against others and the occasions when tolerating something to the benefit of a group or individual is at the cost to others.  How can we be sure that we are not showing biase when deciding what is &#039;crossing the line&#039;
1,11177,2308,10989,Purpose is linked to transparency clarity and honesty all should be evident from the start of any process.
1,11178,2326,10993,common sense may require us to break our own self imposed rules and therefore may well be a good thing
1,11179,2309,10985,The controlling factor in most of our decisions but does not deliver positive outcomes in respect of confidence, justice and many of the other positive words. Is this a disabler rather than enabler
1,11180,2297,10985,Lack of available money in the organisation may mean that despite knowing what we should do to prevent or deal effectively with a potential critical incident, we haveto make choices and take informed risks
1,11181,2299,10984,Justice from whose perspective - it is often clearer if we are talking about criminal offences but what about internal grievences - many people do not feel they have recieved justice simply that the organsation has doe what it needs to to apease people and protect itself
1,11182,2315,10994,Do policies and procedures produce more victims than protect our people?
1,11183,2324,11004,vital to recognise welfare needs affecting several relationships
1,11184,2306,10983,What on earth does that phrase actaully mean?
1,11185,2317,10994,We are public servants and have a legal enforcement role to protect the public and minimise, not just criminality, but the effects of same. Customer and victim responsiveness is not something the organisation is always good at and publication of/media attention to same is fundamentally damaging and does not allow us to break out of the vicious circle of  (at least selectively) lowpublic confidence. We need to refocus on this as an organisational priority. I hope today will help us to achieve this and start the journey.
1,11186,2310,10988,clarity is essential but must be linked to communication, you may be clear about what you are doing but have you managed to communicate it to others with the same degree of clarity.
1,11187,2318,11002,Is telling a lie to protect peoples feelings or stop them becoming anxious ever right?
1,11188,2321,10986,utilitarianism- js mill
1,11189,2302,11002,Be honest with yourself.  That is what really matters.  You maybe able to kid others but the one person that really knows the truth will always be you!
1,11190,2296,11004,Do we as an organisation support? Or sometimes do we just undertake a series of processes that demonstrates this area.
1,11191,2316,11001,It seems generally agreed that TRUST is a fundamental pre-requisite for people being able to work across boundaries - for example, a police officer and a community leader. I actually think that trust devlops later and that the real starting point is RESPECT. I say to people &#039;I don&#039;t expect you to trust me and that&#039;s alright. I do, however, want you to respect me by taking me seriously, as I will you.
1,11192,2318,11002,Is it right to choose who we are transparent to?  Very important when consideing implications for Freedom of Information
1,11193,2312,11002,we need to have honesty of purpose and anticipate / welcome scrutiny but it sometimes cannot be fully at the time
1,11194,2326,10989,Being clear about your purpose is important but approaching a thing with &quot;honesty of purpose&quot; is of critical importance&gt;
1,11195,2307,10994,The manuals may prescibe and identify some of the standards victims can expect but the reality is often different, Victims value and worth is often determined by discriminatory factors Eg. Class ethnicity even post code
1,11196,2308,10985,Risk assessment is essential in identifying how and where financial resources should be directed.
1,11197,2329,10993,When something goes wrong we blame the lack of common sense that was used.<br />What is common sense?
1,11198,2294,10985,whenever people say &quot;its not about the money&quot;.............it usually is!
1,11199,2323,11069,not always about clear answers so difficult to be confident - sometimes confidence comes from involving others
1,11200,2299,10991,in our haste to protect ourselves, reputations and careers as well as the organsation learning is often lost in place of finger pointing
1,11201,2324,11005,is that about protecting own reputation and protect the ones who commit acts of discrimination and deny natural justice
1,11202,2293,10988,too little time spent on doing this too little undersanding of the need. Why? Reservation perhaps for fear of consequences / hedging our bets - rather than conviction belief / standing up for those decisions and maybe defending those consequences. Yet without this where do people follow their leaders
1,11203,2298,11002,Whilst we might accept that we all make mistakes are the media/public equally forgiving. Does our expectation of criticism paralyse our desire to be open and honest.
1,11204,2300,11130,agreed. Transparency, like outcomes need to be defined and agreed. Tp try and do otherwise would be naive and unrealistic.
1,11205,2328,11071,This is a really interesting dimension of balance or lack of balance. Miranda Fricker wrote about how some information, person or value carries more importance for some people or groups than for others. She calls this epistemic imbalance.
1,11206,2326,11001,True respect emerges form love
1,11207,2318,10999,There is no such thing as a norganisation that does not conatin real people within it.  This means that love has a part to play when thinking of such aspects as compasion and caring and feelings towards others.
1,11208,2329,10987,When do you have closure? For some it may take a lot longer to achieve than for others. But at some point we all need it
1,11209,2324,11003,to work towards eradicating the same events again, again, again .....
1,11210,2325,11003,training would play a large part in this process, the more we train and things become second nature to staff, the less opportunity there is for some thing to go wrong, but this of course it limited by money.
1,11211,2321,10983,not always possible. whilst there must be balance and fairness and respect for the principle that people are trying their best there must sometimes be advice or censure. If people do not accept this there can be further problems and not everyone is satisfied so no win -win. Sometimes we just have to accept that this will happen
1,11212,2313,11178,I think the point Einstein makes has been overlooked here. Common Sense means different things to different people. Culture, religion, language, race, gender, class, social background and many other variables all influence our understanding of Common Sense
1,11213,2293,10984,justice or revenge - can be a blured edge
1,11214,2314,10995,We are an orgonisation that reacts and does little actual prevention ie murders. We do little to prevent deaths but are excellent at dealing with the aftermath
1,11215,2299,11059,Talk the talk - but dont walk the walk
1,11216,2316,11181,If we have a legalistic approach to &#039;justice&#039; then people on the defence side will clam up and cover their backs and, even when a complainant wins their case, the relationships at the heart of the matter will be damaged. The organisation needs a relational approach to justice and grievances.
1,11217,2309,10997,We lose sight of this at times of tension or in the midst of critical incidents
1,11218,2308,10996,Fox or Owl ? does it matter as long as there is a successful outcome? Yes if you want to sleep at night.
1,11219,2315,10993,So does common sense tell you that it will be more critical if the incident involves a black member of staff?
1,11220,2329,10991,Do we always learn from our mistakes? &#039;Macpherson&#039; &#039;Secret Policeman
1,11221,2302,11002,Transparency has to be measured.<br />It is not always good to be transparent about everything.  Do we disclose our tactics for dealing with terrorist incidents?<br />Where does National Security fit in with transparency?<br />Food for thought!!
1,11222,2294,10997,I think that there can be satisfaction or enjoyment in resolving difficult and complex problems/incidents in a creative way especially if it works for all those involved
1,11223,2310,10985,how can you turn to a person whose life has been destroyed, or the family of a victim and say we didn&#039;t do the right thing because of money?
1,11224,2293,10990,confidence can make leaders great
1,11225,2311,11027,our role has to be to secure evidence to inform others in the cjs and not exact justice
1,11226,2307,10996,There is a presumption that all officers and staff understand what the service means by this term, clearly the breahes and compromises of integrity littering managers note books and PSD cabinets indicate that there is some learning to be done
1,11227,2319,10996,Warm words, but I bet if you unpicked them one of the first things you&#039;d find is that different people have different views about what constitutes integrity.
1,11228,2318,10995,We need to ensure that steps we take to prevent incidents reoccuring are carefully considered and that we don&#039;t create unforseen negative consequences
1,11229,2292,10996,Isn&#039;t it the case that sometimes politics and other influences may require us to act in ways that challenge our personal integrity?  Are we saying that personal integrity should be the watch word - or is it organisational integrity - can one exist without the other?  I suppose what I&#039;m saying is that sometimes organisations ask us to be foxes.
1,11230,2326,10998,Tolerance is a double edged sword. In some circumstances tolerance of difference is the right road. However should we have tolerated the behaviour of the Nazis?
1,11231,2317,10991,We too often disaster recover a single incident and give insufficient attention to substantive service recovery for the future, missing the opportunity to spread learning about potential prevention across the organisation. We need to focus on substantive service recovery and , at all appropriate times, complete the incident-victim-learning- prevention circle ultimately to achieve a reduction or even erradication of adverse incidents.
1,11232,2307,10998,Tolerance is often considered an offensive word
1,11233,2328,10986,Balance could be what human rights are trying to achieve. Balance could be balancing competing rights in a proportionate, legal, accountable necessary and best information.
1,11234,2307,10993,Should play no part in professional policing it is what gets the service into trouble, time and time again
1,11235,2305,11220,in order to learn from mistakes you have to accept you have made them in the first place
1,11236,2328,11188,Bedrock of policing for 170 years, possibly more Bentham than Mill. Consequentionist thinking has led us into some  nasty, messy dangerous places sometimes.
1,11237,2307,10990,There is little public confidence
1,11238,2317,10983,In our learning, we will need to concede losing unless we are at a perfect, utopian state already which is not the case.
1,11239,2323,11067,good point - more likely with grievance to have wi win at early stage - the longer it goes on the more likely that both sides are losers ?
1,11240,2310,11140,love is too subjectives a concept to really relate to the functions during the day. It can be about doing the right thing, but not necessarily love.
1,11241,2310,11207,All organisations can function without love. Compassion and caring are different entities.
1,11242,2307,10983,You have to decide what your objective is in the first place before you can have a win -win. You may not a guilty conviction but the fact you protected your victim and witness and secure the best eveidence in the circmastances can be a win win
1,11243,2310,11192,FOI has no real impact on this, as we can still hide whatever we want behind the &#039;operational&#039; heading
1,11244,2297,11050,Is it about how the individuals in the organisation feel about themselves and the organisation itself ?
1,11245,2316,11174,This reminds me of Andrew Kakabadze,  a Management professor at the Cranfield Institute who draws a distinction between prescriptive tasks ( how to use a firearm) and discretionary tasks ( which require use of your instincts, intuition and common sense).
1,11246,2299,11053,This is a problem - unfortunately to progress there is no balance - its about work
1,11247,2310,11203,never expect the media to forgive or forget!
1,11248,2325,10992,more and more we do use the power as our discretion has been taken away and replaced by the need to meet  performance targets.
1,11249,2307,10984,There is  a school of thought that says that in respect of justice for black and ethnic minority people, that there is no justice, just us in it. Section 95 data confirms this.
1,11250,2303,11168,Therev are a million and one demands upon my time. My learning is given no interest or importance by others who expect so how can I find the time to use it and expand on it. In reality who is interested in learning?
1,11251,2320,11108,Do we not learn from our personal involvement - when things went wrong - we do them differently next time and when things went well - we use that methodoligy in the future?
1,11252,2310,11010,But when do the rights of the individual become more important than the rights of a community or society?
1,11253,2329,11206,Does that mean you love me???<br />Beceause I hope you respect me from a professional stance even  though you don&#039;t know me.
1,11254,2296,11206,I respect many people but dont love them? Does that mean I cant respect ?<br />Not only people it can be values etc
1,11255,2309,11131,Lives can be put at risk through honesty and transparency. A very difficult balance which often is subject to scrutiny many months or years down the line.
1,11256,2310,11049,an organisation cannot be a victim, as it has no collective feeling or will. It is the individuals that work in that organisation that become the victims.
1,11257,2299,10991,Part of the problem is people are scared to accept they have made a mistake they try to amend it without acknowledgement or attempting to learn from it
1,11258,2307,10985,What proportion of the force spending goes on &quot;toys&quot; versus the personal development of staff
1,11259,2317,10984,We need to be aware of the potential, possibly for the minority to confuse or manipulate the concepts of justice and vengeance and ensure that we &#039;teach&#039; and lead positively. In this regard, this issue is also linked to integrity and fairness and, as such, should be at the heart of all we do.
1,11260,2295,10990,Do we actually have a collective understanding about what it is we do, or how we do it that either builds or corrodes confidence? If our authority and legitimacy are based upon consent - if we don&#039;t stop corroding and start building confidence, all the finance in the world is not going to deliver real confidence and legitimacy in what we do.
1,11261,2326,10996,Integrity is defined by the cultural mind set in which you are operating. We need to strive to understand what &quot;integrity&quot; means to the other players in the scenario. If you dont do this integrity is simply a way of justifying us imposing our favoured position onto others&gt;
1,11262,2328,11020,This might be about managing imperfection. There may never be any complete closure for everyone in some cases. The position might be just that things are slightly better, could be worse, are a least different. Time and healing, pain lessened with distance, change of perspective.
1,11263,2329,11049,But the organisation is big enough to take that, our concern is with &#039;Protecting People&#039;
1,11264,2321,11092,the important thing to victims is that there has been justice or evenan explanation and that we have learned until that happens it is impossible for there to closure.
1,11265,2297,11223,Government objectives, the policing plan, community and partners desires and a lack of resources mean that we have to make such difficult choices every day. Fortunately, most cases do not result in these consequences
1,11266,2316,11197,We are &#039;formed&#039; by family, community, tradition, education. Common sense applies all of this in a way that is truly sensitive to the shortcomings of people as human beings; as less than perfect but, usually, good enough for what is needed.
1,11267,2310,11237,On what do you base this? Public confidence is difficult to quantify, and may be ever changing depending on the circumstances. A lot of the time we cannot directly change this but when we can it is all the more powerful.
1,11268,2319,11042,Isn&#039;t it time in internal relationships to get away from this victim culture? Who wants to volunteer themselves as a victim? Little wonder individuals who are the object of any of the behavioural &#039;-isms&#039; are reluctant to come forward. It should be about setting standards. That way it is the perpetrator who stands out as outside the norm, not the person who is the object of aberrant behaviour. That way anybody can challenge or report.
1,11269,2307,10988,Are you clear about what policing is and should achieve
1,11270,2299,11224,It also makes them arrogant and unable to listen - there is now a school of thought that believes the confident carismatic leader is a liability as they do not fully embrace their teams ideas and can leave a negative legacey
1,11271,2293,11063,Surely confidence can at times overcome the need for those other things even transparency - people can believe and trust regardless of the reality - create an illusion. There may even be benefit in that. Enable people to believe. eg to combat  low crime high fear or motivate and get people to follow to your goal
1,11272,2310,11107,This cannot be true if you don&#039;t buy in to the course of action. In that scenario you will never be comfortable or feel rewarded.
1,11273,2295,10993,This is a misleading and potentially dangerous term. Why do people still want to use it?
1,11274,2296,11173,I do not think an organisation can support. An organisation can set guidelines,but individuals offer the support.
1,11275,2303,11237,There s little public interest until it effects them. It is all situational and reactive. Hard bit is it can spin on one job and the medias reaction to it
1,11276,2312,11157,respect works when it is a two way process. If it isn&#039;t reciprocated it is undermined.
1,11277,2313,11234,I tend to agree - didn&#039;t the old time detectives often use common sense when deciding where the guilt should lie? I&#039;d like to think that in 2006 policing has moved on....
1,11278,2298,11058,Is it about developing such networks in advance of a critical incident to provide support during and in the aftermath of the crisis. What should such networks look like. Is it about creating resilience?
1,11279,2317,10999,Love, for me, is a sentimental word for passion. We need to love and be passionate in all we do and want, more than anything, to make a difference. As such, I can love within this organisation and want this from all of my colleagues. It is a brave person who can use this word so openly, thank you.
1,11280,2321,11224,sometimes it makes people who think they are great leaders but they are wrong and are the exact opposite even arrorgant
1,11281,2328,11216,This triggers thinking about natural justice, legalistic, as well as the comments abot revenge that are mentioned  below.
1,11282,2323,11229,I think sometimes we lose sight of corporacy being an important part of integrity
1,11283,2302,11203,Yes
1,11284,2326,10984,The majority of comments are based on a narrow definition of &quot;justice&quot;. The aspiration should be a just outcome that may have very little to do with our system of justice or the CJS itself.
1,11285,2319,11125,Always presuming, of course, that your values and norms are RIGHT! Hmm!
1,11286,2310,11108,We can only learn from debriefs etc when we actually take the information and change our behaviour or systems or procedures
1,11287,2297,11258,What do you mean by toys ??
1,11288,2329,11230,We should never tolerate difference we should embrace It. Difference brings this organisation a world of wealth, knowledge and eduaction. Without difference this organsiation would have failed in many critical incidents!!!
1,11289,2306,11243,Oh! Well thats OK then !  A rather revealing interpretation!
1,11290,2318,11237,I think there is huge public confidence - but this means that there is huge dissapointment when we as individuals or an organisation betray that confidence. If people did not have such expectations of us then it would not suprise them when we do the rwrong things.
1,11291,2316,11005,Greater Manchester Police will be a better service if it sees itself as &#039;the community within&#039; and tries to model what a healthy community should look like. In this way, the outer community will be attracted to it and want to have some of what the police appear to have.
1,11292,2310,11168,Does it matter where the learning is from provided you are learning - and most importantly changing your behaviour, outlook etc
1,11293,2328,11284,This is not unrelated to the discussion under balance.
1,11294,2301,11218,20 or 30 yrs ago foxes were encouraged, valued and  rewarded within the CJ system. Times, values and rules have changed so that now the best way to achieve an outcome is more often than not the right way. hoot hoot
1,11295,2307,10989,When it is the rule that officers know the communities they police and recognise that no witness or confidence equates to no justice, then we will have the appropriate purpose
1,11296,2329,11232,That&#039;s beacuse it is when used in many aspects. I was once told as a member of this organisation that I was only tolerated for being &#039;different&#039; and not accepted.
1,11297,2293,11270,How then to enable people to strive to a goal that can only be imagined. Confidence and belief can empower people to believe themselves climb mountains once seen as unachievable. Why does confidence mean arrogance?
1,11298,2323,11134,are we getting into &quot; shut up and move on territory &quot;?
1,11299,2324,11220,NO. Little change from ranks above the student bobbies as the same still exists
1,11300,2310,11076,it would be more common if people in positions of power listened to those that may provide it
1,11301,2318,11015,How do we make sure we learn from others mistakes so that we don&#039;t make them ourseves
1,11302,2314,11023,The police are very poor at learning from their own mistakes or propogating good practice. We always seem to make the same mistakes over and over again or re-invent the same wheel. Knowledge management is the key to improving performance and yet we commit little resources
1,11303,2303,10997,You need to feel a little bit safe to enjoy the high demand high pressure part of these incidents. Big role for the organisation and us as leaders to give people that confidence and skills to do it, feel it and not be too afraid
1,11304,2309,11088,It is individuals that love, and organisational norms that stifle that showing of love
1,11305,2313,11054,unfortunately I can give examples of many &#039;common sense&#039; decisions that were neither....
1,11306,2296,11291,How is this achieved? Is it achieveable ?
1,11307,2292,11125,how about try to undrstand how they would wish to be treated and then see whether you can deliver that
1,11308,2321,11018,but who are your victims, witnesses and offenders in any situation
1,11309,2306,11203,yes the public are forgiving of genuine mistakes. They are not forgiving of &#039;cover ups&#039; and dishonesty over mistakes.
1,11310,2317,11002,To instill confidence we must give information (as opposed to intelligence though) openly, be honest internally and externally about our position including mistakes in order to arrive at shared solutions for the future.

1,11319,2302,10999,Love is an emotion.  Emotions cloud logical thinking.<br />Therefore, is love a quality that should be considered when dealing with a critical incident?
1,11320,2329,11306,By having a more diverse organisation, simple really!. And by attracting those individuals and really hanging on to them and getting rid of the revolving door and sticky floors and glass ceilings.

1,11325,2297,11311,fear of confronting / admitting the truth ?
1,11326,2310,11319,that is a good point, our emotions should not drive our actions
1,11327,2301,11223,we are not alone in this. How does Oxfam or the Save the children et al, tell dying thousands their resources are going elsewhere. By being open, transparent and realising their limitations.
1,11328,2318,11274,I was once told by someone off work that they had had no contact from the force, only from their Inspector and Divisional Commander - how do we get a position that people are seen as seperate from an organisation?
1,11329,2313,11219,Again, from a particular perspective it may well appear to be the case. However, from a BME perspective it may appear that little if anything has changed and indeed nothing will.
1,11330,2328,11284,We need to consider miscarriages of justice including those where we fail to deliver justice or even fail to explain why we cannot deliver justice for all.
1,11331,2323,11311,Fear of getting it wrong can lead to inaction - that can be worse .
1,11332,2324,11313,RACE is a serious issue for the Police service but the &#039;diversity&#039; agenda has diluted the most obvious concerns
1,11333,2308,11313,Love, respect,tolerance,morality,integrity all cover the issue of race, does it need to be a seperate catagory.
1,11334,2317,11005,I prefer the &#039;organisational health check&#039; interpretation of this &#039;heading&#039; since it could be read as an organisation adopting a defensive defensive position.
1,11335,2329,11313,Why couldn&#039;t we have this under the same umberella as diversity
1,11336,2302,11326,I&#039;m glad you agree.  Now we are moving towards consensus
1,11337,2293,11312,why a separate word - segmented off rather than integral to respect / integrity / tolerance / learning and understadning - perhaps if we truely understood these words we would truely understand the importance of all aspects of &#039;diversity&#039;
1,11338,2319,11187,It&#039;s about choices and living with the consequences of the choices we make. Rule of thumb: ask yourself what will be the impact generally and spe.cifically and how will you feel when the lie is found out
2,11339,0,0,knowledge
1,11340,2315,11311,fear of not sticking to policies and procedures even though they may be wrong.
1,11341,2299,11317,They must be sound as defined by set criteris - just to say &quot;what is right&quot; is far too simplistic as it is open to subjectivity
1,11342,2310,11311,fear is part of life, if we didn&#039;t experience fear then we would be extinct as we would have never run away from the sharp toothed beasts. Fear can help us to learn through experiences.
1,11343,2303,11319,Emotional intelligence of which love is a part is very important in decision making. logic without emotion is lacking in dimension
1,11344,2302,11332,What are they?
1,11345,2326,11311,Fear in the context of critical incident management can be strangle and constrain creativity. To be creative often involves taking risks; this can be the very last thing you want to inject into an already risk laden situation.

1,11350,2324,11318,An event which is likely to affect people and organisation, influence long term relationships, costs and human resource
1,11351,2294,11002,few people are completely open and honest and the ones who are get viewed with suspicion.<br />transparency is about being clear about what is going on and not hiding things so that everyone can see how issues are progressed and resolved
1,11352,2310,11314,how can tenacity be part of a critical incident scenario?
1,11353,2318,11004,We need to recognise that someitimes being seen to support someone who has done something blatantly wrong that has had an adverse impact on others will bring criticsm on us.  But we need to remember that we are dealing with people and make conscious decisions about what we do.
1,11354,2306,11312,a diverse organistion will always outperfom a homogeneous one. The inevitable tensions and abrasiveness, once resolved, result in a more vibrant and dynamic organisation better able to deal with complex probelms
1,11355,2321,11313,this still exists in the organisation but it is clearly unacceptable and has gone &#039;underground&#039; where it still influences the behaviour of the organistion.We must question our own behaviour and those who work with us to understand their motivation and ensure they are not acting in a racist manner.
1,11356,2315,11335,Because sometimes it may be different in terms of impact on individuals and organisations and our communities!
1,11357,2309,11311,Fear can be a positive instinct to enable survival.If it results from organisational intollerance it is totally disabling
1,11358,2313,11333,I&#039;m afraid all the wealth of research, public inquiries, the demography of the police service suggest that race is a key feature in terms of experience internally and police service delivery
1,11359,2329,11344,race, sexual orientation, gender, disability, religion, age and many many more. Don&#039;t fall into the trap of thinking there are only 6 elements to this word. Think out of that box!!!
1,11360,2310,11149,we shouldn&#039;t think in terms of male and female but it is part of our conditioning. Unfortunately, it is something that the organisation still hasn&#039;t challenged.
1,11361,2293,11311,as I get older I fear less  and with that comes greater honestly - how do you get the wisdom of age without aging. Fear is so destructive yet a natural instinct in life
1,11362,2307,11312,Diversity is not just a word it characterises the complexity of humanity
1,11363,2314,11347,we do not learn - tacit knowledge is sat there in the corporate memory and it dies when people leave - we must drive knowledge management
1,11364,2305,11007,all about perseption
1,11365,2303,11345,Fear is healthy when dealing with high stakes of very real consequences for human beings and groups. To be without fear of this is to acting like a divine being. It needs to be healthy fear that informs thinking but does not stifle ability to respond
1,11366,2298,11309,I agree but our perception/fear of the public/media response is real and until we address this we will continue to &quot;cover up&quot; and make matters worse.
1,11367,2318,11243,Just because we can hide something - should we?
2,11368,0,0,respect
1,11369,2300,11311,There is an organisational norm that requires police (officers and staff) to show no fear as we intervene in situations of crisis. This is often interpreted as arrogance and has a de-humanising effect on how we are viewed. Showing no fear os too often confused with the need to be confident.
1,11370,2310,11322,why is this important? feelings is such a randomn word
1,11371,2324,11348,how easy to is to hide your skin colour and deny your existance, and compare this to other &quot;strands&quot;?
1,11372,2303,11003,We need depth for this and long termism have we really got this in GMP?
1,11373,2299,11313,It is not just about race, religion etc. it is about difference and embracing difference.  That includes all of the above but goes right down to things like personality - we have to be more tolerent of those that simply do not fit the mould as WE see it
1,11374,2318,11193,Why not?
1,11375,2323,11187,does anyone know the origin of &quot;white lie 2 and wheter there ii an issue with that terminology ?
1,11376,2329,11318,Any incident which is likely to have an adverse impact on the community. e.g Secret Policeman, Macpherson, Manchester Pride
1,11377,2316,11184,Now that you ask, the phrase is associated with  two Harvard professors, Roger Fisher and Bill Ury. But maybe it is laden with American cultural assumptions about acquiring things.<br />In many conflict situations, win/win is an inappropriate concept because there is no compromise as such and people need to settle for non-achievement; for managing enmity; for conflict management rather than resolution.
2,11378,0,0,respect
1,11379,2310,11347,you have to be allowed to breath and develop to have experience...when was the last time you tried something different
1,11380,2312,11234,I can&#039;t accept common sense should play no part in policing! Isn&#039;t falling back on policy and proceedures sometimes just the easy way out?
1,11381,2311,11035,I thought it was 16 years of age
1,11382,2297,11314,Do we mean resilience ?
1,11383,2294,11352,because you need adegree of tenacity to carry through an effective and appropriate response to difficult issues not fudge it because its too hard to do!
1,11384,2329,11324,One individuals fairness is anothers unfairness???
1,11385,2313,11350,I think confidence is a key word missing in the above. An incident that is likely to erode the confidence of staff, community, stakeholders etc.
1,11386,2292,11348,Every strand of diversity is important but the strands are not the same.  While disability and race will share things in common there are also significant differences.  It is possible to have a definition of diversity that does not dilute each separate component but actually builds liklihood of overcoming resistance to change.
1,11387,2326,11318,Generally it means &quot;big trouble&quot;. The natural response to this is one of defence  often involving risk avoidance and sticking to the tried and tested solutions. If it is possible to approach a critical incident as a thing that by definition offers you big opportunities may encourage a more creative approach.
1,11388,2306,11332,if dealt with correctly the so called &quot;diverstiy agenda&quot; should enhance - not dilute the fight agiast racsim within the police. Different groups have the common experience of being onthe wrong end of pejudice, discrimination etc and can add thier weigh to the fight
1,11389,2315,11355,Is it not the organisation which needs to grasp this, take responsibility and do something about it?  Don&#039;t leave to lone voices and victims?
1,11390,2325,11324,this come down to peoples perception of things surely
1,11391,2308,11346,This is an esssential element in the delivery of any plan, far to often in the past we have adopted a &#039; we know best &#039; attitude. We should value and utilise the knowledge and expertise of others. This will lead to a balanced approach that takes into account many of the issues raised in this forum today.
1,11392,2295,11318,I think the basic terminology may be a problem here. &#039;Critical&#039; by definition insists on a degree of gravity and seriousness. However, there are many examples of non-&#039;critical&#039; incidents that go on to have the &#039;effect&#039; of eroding confidence. I think we need to learn to get better at understanding the likely outcomes and effects, than by trying the assess the front end incident itself.
1,11393,2324,11324,Fairness can only be acheived by a level playing fields, not ticking convenient boxes and making political appoints doomed to fail due to lack of confidence
1,11394,2310,11369,in a world that is ever changing - the police service can provide a &#039;we know where we are going and what we are doing&#039; image to the public. They don&#039;t want to hear &#039;this is scary&#039; when the bullets are flying ....the public will have worked that out already.
1,11395,2319,11220,Isn&#039;t it funny how hardly anybody resigns anymore, except when the pension is already guaranteed and the rubber heels are breathing down their necks? What appetite is there organisationally to clean the dirty laundry, rather than circle the wagons and go into seige mode?
1,11396,2329,11311,Individuals fears of wondering of what the organisation can do to me
1,11397,2321,11311,ethnic minority groups especially within a predominently white organisation experience a lot of fear. Standing up to racist behaviour singles them out even more and subjects them to more prejudice but labelled in a different negative way when the real motivation of the critic is racism
1,11398,2294,11368,I think respect is in danger of becoming a very over used word with a multiplicity of meanings
1,11399,2302,11318,Back covering time!!
1,11400,2307,11313,The results of racism can and have lead to dispropotionate stop and search, excess use of force and even deaths in custody. it as much in common with the diversity agenda but not constantly so.
1,11401,2296,11346,The Police are at the forefront of partnership working. However, does our enthusiasm for this mean our partners are not always able to develop? -  hence the police leadership and drive may become a blockage in this area as it is sometimes seen as a police agenda.
1,11402,2298,11192,There are occasions where it is right to withold information, or at least consider doing so, but in reaching the right decision we need another perspective. IAGs have a critical role to play in providing this perspective.
1,11403,2313,11373,Tolerant? of difference. Interesting.
1,11404,2318,11002,There is on occasion a huge consequence in being honest and open - the time and resources required to deal with impact of honesty can be very significant and stop you getting on with the issues. How do you decide if the balance in what you want to do against the conseuence of doing it is right - This is where the role of IAG members advice is really important.
1,11405,2293,11218,Worse still if you are Fox that believes you are an owl - the most dangerous of characters in a position of influence
1,11406,2309,11346,The involvement of partners and external stakeholders should not be involved when an incident has been seen to go wrong, but must be embraced in the learning from one incident and be listened to, and learned from for future potential events.
1,11407,2325,11339,this should not only be knowledge of the jobs we do but also knowledge of the communities we police together they can only drive us forward
1,11408,2306,11371,hos easy is it to hide some disabilites ?  How easy is it to get back inthe closet once you have been &#039;ot and proud&#039; as lesbian or gay? How easy it it to hide you gender - the figh against sexism in the police is a long way from being won.
1,11409,2317,11311,We have a professional responsibility to our colleagues internally to help instill confidence in lieu of fear; this may be achieved by a range of learning mechanisms, not just traditional traing or e learning but by shadowing, leadership, being role models and developing positive cultures. I cannot submit too strongly the massive inhibitor which fear is to improvement. If we do not address, acorns grow into oak trees and we become institutionalised in our inertia. Moreover, by not addressing key incidents or issues we actually worsen organisational performance and, sometimes, permit the discreditation of (say) minority groups wrongly and unfairly. As leaders we should enable others to be confident to anticipate, address and deal expediently with key issues arising.
1,11410,2312,11294,didn&#039;t the police change just because it got caught out too many times? Have the sanctions lead to an educating effect and change of mindset?n
1,11411,2301,11242,No. You may have done your best but accept it was not good enough and resolve to learn by it. Next time you may need to be more foxy.
1,11412,2310,11318,the definition is being clouded by what is a reputational incident and what is operational. There hasn&#039;t yet been a clear understanding of what Gold meetings do, or why they are called. I am sure some people attend and aren&#039;t sure why they are there.
1,11413,2303,11373,We should not forget the need to embrace everyone there are many of the larger groups who feel disenfranchsed and ignored because they are not from minority groups. We need to be inclusive on all fronts
1,11414,2305,11100,it&#039;s often only when they accept that they are wrong can progress be made.
1,11415,2324,11003,a committment to educate and prevent, dismiss when all else fails
1,11416,2302,11339,Without sufficient knowledge the approach to a critical incident could be disastrous.<br />Don&#039;t confuse knowledge with experience.
1,11417,2320,11291,An excellent sentiment, but it is often impossible to satisfy all of the people all of the time, especially when there are so many fractions
1,11418,2310,11339,to demonstrate knowledge you have to listen and learn - I am not sure we have got those yet
1,11419,2307,11368,Agree it means different things to different people. Should we not have a glossary of what these terms mean to us and therefore the public will know what it mean and looks like in gmp
1,11420,2314,11370,as an orgonisation we can set the rules and guidance but it always ends up with how our leaders feel about the issue that influences what they do about it
1,11421,2309,11324,Achieving farness is utopia however is it achievable when personal perceptions and needs are often at odds
1,11422,2312,11414,but if we wrap things up as &quot;everyone is right but some are more right than others&quot; where is the trigger to change behaviour?
1,11423,2317,11312,I am dissapointed in myself that I did not consider the initial inclusion of this concept in the first &#039;what matters&#039; list.
1,11424,2324,11415,Managers who allow discrimination, turn a blind eye also need to be re-educated on their failings
1,11425,2310,11391,But unfortunately when things go wrong the public, media and whoever is in No 10 will look to the police service for the answers and for a solution.
1,11426,2318,11311,The only way to be brave is to do brave things - Mathew Paris
1,11427,2328,10984,To quote from a movie called I think, Ride the High Country: &quot;I just want to enter my house justified&quot;. I was justified to do or say what I did. This might be a personal sense of justice. A very dangerous psychological place for a cop to be.
1,11428,2326,11347,On one level experience is a positive thing but a negative spin off is that it is often accompanied by a narrowing down in your span of thinking. Build your experience but maintain with it a healthy degree of naivity that will allow you to dare to be different.
1,11429,2306,11335,diversity should not be seen as an &quot;unbrella&quot; rather a multi pronged fork with which to fight pejudice and discrimination. Several prongs each with thier own issues are more powerful than a blunt &#039;melting pot&#039; of diversity issues
1,11430,2310,11426,how can you be brave when you are tied into circumstance, procedure and regulations
1,11431,2314,11311,we sometimes fear so much we fear to act
1,11432,2300,11318,this is an approach to priority setting. In a perfect world every incident could get the same response but reality intervenes and we have to use a methodology to apply priority.
1,11433,2323,11370,if we lose sight of people&#039;s feelings we may lose sight of support needed and our solutions may be missing vital ingredients
1,11434,2307,11346,We still underestimate the significance of community engagement and intelligence. White men primarily making decisions they understand liitle about formany it is a game, lets be hones
1,11435,2329,11358,Why does this make you afraid, it is reality based on lot&#039;s of research and academia, Race is an issue in police services and one that we still need to grasp properly if we want to win the&#039;race&#039;
1,11436,2303,11370,ultimately our subjective assessments or feelings on issues are waht often guide us and the communities we serve. We may often seek to objectively justify what we subjectively decide but that is the reality. As creatures of huge emotion how we feel as individuals and groups is our context for assessments and decisions
1,11437,2292,11400,there is certainly much in common - look at how prejudice against people with mental ill health issues has impacted on their welfare and safety.  And there is all the crossover - the increased liklihood of being diagnosed as mentally ill and unsafe if you are Black.  The interconnections are important , so are the differences; the agenda needs to be able to hold all without diluting any.
1,11438,2324,11001,Avoid demonising the victims and recognise human values
1,11439,2321,11318,inherent in this definition is a large amount of subjectivity thats why it is so difficult at times. The bare facts of an incident can sometimes not be as revealing as an understanding of an incident, i.e why has it happened and what is likely to happen next
1,11440,2312,11374,because the disclosure of some facts can have negative consequences. As long as we are held to account at the earliest opportunity we may have to live with that.
1,11441,2318,11318,We need to be clear on critical to who - Local neighbourhood, Division or Branch, Force, Regional, National or Global.  The scale does not trivialise the impcat on individuals but needs to be considered when pressing the &#039;panic button&#039;
1,11442,2319,11389,Who is the organisation? Do a little exercise: get a group of people in a room and ask every individual whether s/he is the organisation. Eventually, after all the others have denied it, you will be left with one person. TAKE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY. We are all &#039;the organisation&#039;. Be a part of the solution. If not, guess what you become... ?
1,11443,2293,11396,How sad! An amorphous being &#039;the organisation&#039; and the impact that can have whether by realit of belief
1,11444,2307,11347,The service exploits the knowledge of black and ethnic minority staff with out reward or recognition
1,11445,2318,11318,WHen the little voice in the back of your head says &#039;sxxt&#039;
1,11446,2329,11423,Don&#039;t be disappointed it may be that you have a grasp of the issues and have embedded and mainstramed them into all aspects of what you do, so for you it is not a standalone thing. Then maybe you haven&#039;t??????????
1,11447,2294,11311,fear is often the basis of prejudice and discrimination.It also exists within the organisation and supervisors are frightened of dealing robustly with inappropriate behavour in case they get it wrong or are accused themselves of rascism or sexism etc
1,11448,2313,11435,nothing more than my personal style in trying to put over an uncomfortable message for some....
1,11449,2316,11319,Love isn&#039;t always an emotion. Often it is a decision and one that has to overcome one&#039;s feelings.
1,11450,2292,11313,Would we be able to have the same frank conversation face to face?  if not (and I suspect not) that&#039;s a real challenge for the organisation.
1,11451,2310,11433,but how do we know what other people are feeling?
1,11452,2324,11191,if you are still working with community leaders then you have FAILED
1,11453,2296,11318,Do competing priorities allow the potential for a critical incident to increase? Divisions sometimes work in isolation and may allow the force to be more exposed to this potential.
1,11454,2326,11346,Do it with clarity of purpose and be precise in their ownwership of the issue.
1,11455,2298,10987,This must be about identifying and taking individuals or groups to address ongoing issues. Organisationally there are significant risks from taking our eye off the ball when moving to the next crisis or priority.
1,11456,2317,11318,A critical incident is, frankly, any occurrence which does not accord with an organisation&#039;s values, statutory responsibilities or reason for being. Also, get used to it being potentially single issue based. A critical incident may affect only one individual(or even be a &#039;near miss&#039;)but still be absolutely crical in undermining the organisation.
1,11457,2328,11378,Closely linked to fairness justice and balance. Also related to empathy. Liking people as a general rule, not allowing cynicism to take over from a healthy scepticism
1,11458,2329,11429,It needs to be an umbereall to stop the glass ceiling falling on our heads.
1,11459,2306,11373,tolerance ? no thanks  I dont just want to be tolerated.
1,11460,2318,11419,One of our biggest problems is people often argue over something not realising they are talking about different things

1,11512,2309,11462,No corpracy of management style
1,11513,2310,11465,can be for a range of issues including crime, personnel, reputation
1,11514,2314,11511,we need to speak to them early
1,11515,2309,11462,If you only judge staff on outputs we have a problem
1,11516,2309,11462,Limited investment in staff
1,11517,2314,11501,Those with moral fibre move the orgonisation on
1,11518,2310,11465,it is about recognising a developing major problem and at that point start to get additional help in the situation
1,11519,2309,11462,perforamnce culture, keep HMI and other happy
1,11520,2310,11465,declaring a critical incident might have negative consequences ...such as if it involves an individual
1,11521,2314,11504,Do we refuse to turn over the stone because we don&#039;t want to find out whats underneath
1,11522,2309,11462,Change seems to be systemic and next new idea, quality less important
1,11523,2309,11462,Trust in our people to go out deliver
1,11524,2314,11504,Move victims to avoid a problem - its easier than dealing with the perpatrator
1,11525,2309,11462,Defensive of management failings
1,11526,2314,11496,Must put in place structures to proactively find the problems not just to react
1,11527,2310,11465,subjective - it isn&#039;t clear cut depends on lots of factors
1,11528,2314,11504,Everyone wants a level playing field - no favours
1,11529,2314,11504,Sanctions should not be discriminatory
1,11530,2310,11464,Are we owls or foxes - in the handling and recognition of critical incidents?
1,11531,2314,11504,Race
1,11532,2309,11462,Debate academic and remote from issues
1,11533,2314,11531,If white officer has grievance on white officer then delat with as local issue. If black probationer complains about white sgt then it becomes a critical incident - why? then answer is FEAR
1,11534,2310,11465,organisational risk when people think it is about highlighting their weakness if they need to ask for support to handle a situation
1,11535,2314,11463,Conversation so far
1,11536,2314,11535,too many quiet people
1,11537,2314,11535,complex issues
1,11538,2309,11462,Introspective little cognisance of any one else but us
1,11539,2310,11464,Effective leadership
1,11540,2314,11535,Orgonisation which needs to put values into practice
1,11541,2310,11539,recognising an incident and demonstrating leadership in handling it
1,11542,2309,11462,Need to find out what factors conspire to result in poor performance not wait till we go red
1,11543,2310,11539,and feeding back the learning afterwards
1,11544,2314,11535,The conversations are too high level - not finding out how people tick
1,11545,2310,11539,fear of doing the wrong thing at an early stage - particularly at lower ranks of the organisation. Who takes responsibility?
1,11546,2314,11535,What cost a critical incident - money, resources, credibility
1,11547,2309,11462,police staff are supporting the front line not recognised
1,11548,2314,11535,Lack of a mediation service - external only
1,11549,2314,11535,Societies expecatations and their needs might not be the individual staffs views and thus they interpret the orgonisational views accordingly
1,11550,2314,11535,Police is a family and should treat others as a family member
1,11551,2310,11539,we have to find a crime - as the police it is about action, which can create barriers
1,11552,2314,11535,Broaden out of range of approaches
1,11553,2309,11462,PCSO work well because we let them go out with out prescribing their full role
1,11554,2310,11539,use of language is critical in the organisation, aggressive, macho, action
1,11555,2310,11539,public will forgive mistakes, but won&#039;t forgive a cover up or the abuse of power
1,11556,2314,11535,Diversity issue introduces a fear issue - how do my peers see me - whats the heirarchy -<br />whay is more frightening to be called racist than any other name.<br />You can produce incredible change by introducing the word racism.<br />We do not have conversations about race and diversity
1,11557,2309,11462,Lack of understanding and recognition of critical incidents, Definition not inclusive
1,11558,2310,11464,do diversity issues get &#039;ramped up&#039; because no on wants to deal with them
1,11559,2314,11535,superficial conversation - not dealt with the key issues - fear?<br />race is an agenda item - important.<br />strict enforcement of drink drive has modified attitudes - will the same be for diversity in the long term. Will it effect orgonisational change? probaly only when the cuture changes.
1,11560,2310,11558,it needs to be raised as if we deal at a low level it never comes to the attention of the organisation to deal with
1,11561,2309,11462,Critical incidents - particularly internal. Does the current definition enable us to identify the everyday, drip-drip type of incidents which may be &#039;sub-critical&#039; in nature - but then reach a tipping point and cause a domino effect that really does become a critical incident.<br />If we are so focused as an organisation on process and outputs, how can we identify such issues?
1,11562,2314,11535,Do we naval gaze too much? is the public really interested in what the police do. Are we at the top of the publics conversation agenda - no?
1,11563,2314,11535,Leadership - role models
1,11564,2314,11535,Are icons useful to the orgonisation to demonstrate what you can do
1,11565,2314,11535,do people still ask the question of staff - are they there because they are female or black etc?
1,11566,2314,11535,We are learning - we have changed considerably but we still have key issues to achieve
1,11567,2314,11535,There is always a target for peoples prejudices - women, bme&#039;s, graduates,

2,11617,0,0,Mark Linnell
1,11618,2294,11571,10 - days: Maintain contact with Alan Green/Rob Taylor/Robyn Williams to see what other active role I might take in assisting GMP to move further forward in addressing issues relating to diversity and eqality

1,11620,2307,11603,Over the next ten days it is imperative that I stay sane. After some of the discussion today feel like things haven&#039;t moved very far in the organisation (although I know this not to be entirel true) I was bemused at how individuals became defensive about being tricked into the exercise and even after the learning refused to acknowledge the problem.<br />Next ten days stay focused, cool and calm and respect the fact that my collegues are willing to learn.
1,11621,2318,11583,10 weeks:<br />Nothing unless invited.
1,11622,2317,11597,In 10 days I will have reviewed how I approach internal critical incidents and assess whether I am just taking the comfortable path in decision making. But also to begin to consider how to challenge myself

1,11629,2306,11593,10 days|:keep my &quot;antennae tuned&quot; for small indicators which may develop into something more major - and voice my concerns early on to the relevant people.
1,11630,2318,11621,I am an outsider.
1,11631,2329,11596,10 weeks<br />Whole staff meeting providing an opportunity in public and private forum to raise issues of concern and discuss the concepts of criticality.
1,11632,2328,11605,10 days - think about whats been said and written and talk to anyone from this group who wants to talk to me. Some  identified themselves to me already.<br />10 weeks - complete the analysis share with everyone in the group.Continue talking and listening. Discuss analysis with anyone.<br />10 months - meet with everyone, ask question where are we with internal critical incidents.<br />10 years - Review what has happened.
1,11633,2317,11597,In 10 weeks I will have shared some of this process with the management team and if possible with the staff to ensure they can identify issues and critical incidents in the early stages.
1,11634,2296,11587,10 days:pose a personal question - is the absence today one of personal ignorance / lack on conscience and therefore does this effect the way in which I manage incidents.<br />What is it that have to significantly change in the way I manage to address this and therefore what enanles me to potentially better approach incidents.
1,11635,2302,11578,evaluate - hopefully on a joint basis
1,11636,2293,11606,Ten weeks- To ensure I apply for  relevant training in this area through available avenues of training. To seek feedback from my Line Manager in relation to how I have dealt with these incidents previously.
1,11637,2299,11574,Ten Days:<br />Focus on critical incident identification. Think of ways to identify internal critical incidents at the earliest point possible. Having considered all the issues documented on todays mind map I would scan areas of activity in order to identify incidents or issues which cause concern.
1,11638,2307,11603,I0 Weeks - Continue to thirve in my role in Diversity Command knowing that I can make change happen. Knowing that there are some people still willing to listen and learn and try to educate those defensive individuals into a better understanding of the issues.<br />Continue to respect and value those that I did previously regardless of some of the things I saw and heard today.
1,11639,2324,11599,10 DAYS<br />Initially I won&#039;t do anything openly in the first 10 days.  I&#039;ll probably go home tonight and discuss the content of the day with my wife.<br />I&#039;ll probably speak informally too one or two of the people who attended today and get an understanding of how they think the day went.<br />The only thing that would generate some form of action in the next 10 days would be if I faced the prospect of dealing with what I perceive to be a critical incident.<br />I would want to do the &#039;right&#039; thing without offending anybody or causing damge to the reputation of others, the organsisation or myself.
1,11640,2329,11596,Contact a number of individuals present today to exchange learning that has been obtained by their group after today
1,11641,2323,11570,10 weeks - Ongoing support for force, command team, new head of diversity, officers and support associations- conferences, inspection activity. training and consultation
1,11642,2332,11617,10 days: Reflect on the issues raised during the day and determine areas that I can make improvements in.
1,11643,2292,11573,10 weeks:<br />i)To review the proposed force policy on the operational management of critical incidents in light of the learning from today.<br />ii) To have the force policy on critical incidents accepted and established with appropraite training and learning support throughout the organisation.

1,11645,2333,11589,10 days - I will reflect on discussions today and issues raised and be more responsive to the range of influences which may impact upon defining of critical incidents and my response to them, specifically ongoing incidents within my area of responsibility. I will consider how my behaviour impacts upon others in dealing with incidents and the response of others to these encouraging more open discussion of feelings, opinions and involvement.
1,11646,2328,11598,10 days work hard to get the information from the session together for a report
1,11647,2310,11590,10days<br />1. Brief my management team on how to deal with the next critical incident as I will be on leave for 9 of those10 days.<br />2.Should the incident occur on the day I return i will hopefully show a greater awareness of the different people that may be affected by such an incident.<br />3. Ensure I am better informed as to just what the Force believes constitutes a critical incident.
1,11648,2294,11571,10 - weeks: Dependent on the responses from the &#039;10 days&#039; exercise, seek to devise a maximum of three tasks/interventions and at least one with which to get involved and complete within the 10 months.
1,11649,2301,11594,10 weeks - To offer and assist in implementing the new Diversity strategy, particularly focussing upon issues of race
1,11650,2323,11570,10 months - As at 10 weeks on an ongoing basis
1,11651,2329,11596,10 months<br />Have implemented plans to manage or address identified risks<br />Review critical risk identification procedures as developed at 10 day stage.
1,11652,2315,11595,10 days - Clarify in my own mind what does the issue of race mean  in GMP - should it be an issue on its own or just a sub-set of wider diversity. What are the wider implications both positive and negative for a decision either way.
1,11653,2328,11598,10 weeks work with colleagues to generate an analysis of the material to identify themes and issues to bring back to GMP and share with the Chief
1,11654,2334,11600,10 days- I will reflect on the discussion today and on my own attitudes and responses to dealing with critical incidents.<br />I will try to develop a better frame of reference which considers the impact of in appropriate behahvior, bullying and harassment on individuals, particularly on race grounds.I will seek to ensure that this approach is reflected in the way I deal with grievance, discipline and related issues.
1,11655,2298,11592,Ascertain the precise concerns and perceived problems affecting the work environment - recognise the alternative points of views and analyse the affect on morale, trust, confidence and disseminate details amongst the policy and decision makers
1,11656,2336,11604,10 Days - Reflect on the days activities and the learning experience of the exercise. I will do this by taking any challenges from the day and work out how a resolution can be met in the future.<br />10 weeks - Look at where I am now in the organisation and in my personal life in terms of delivering a response to the original question. In the weeks to this stage I would have looked at some of the issues raised from the exercise started to make some changes in the way that I would handle a critical incident.
1,11657,2326,11582,10 weeks - will no longer be part of the GMP family but before then will seek to add value to CC&#039;s vision and his plans to get a ticket to the party.  I would like to leave a legacy which enables those here today to be what they need to be in delivering a police service built on fairness.
1,11658,2310,11590,10 weeks<br />1. review force critical incidents in the last ten weeks and see what I can learn from them and how they were resolved.
1,11659,2328,11598,10 months to be invited to the party to celebrate the enormous creativity of the team
1,11660,2303,11589,10 Days<br />Review current operations (documenting the process) for their potential impact on staff and the public. What are the lessons from today that are transferable?<br />10 Weeks<br />Ensure proposed 360&#039; review of Branch management team is completed and that the results are taken on board and implemented as appropriate.
1,11661,2305,11580,For the next 10 days, 10 months &amp; 10 years I will continue to treat people as I have done throughout the whole of my service. With dignity, respect,  understanding &amp; by not being judgemental.
1,11662,2296,11587,10 weeks: How do we deal with issues on the division and within my sphere of influence - what evidence or lack of it is there - I have no awareness of the levels of formal feedback (grievance) though a a feel informally!<br />As a management team in respect of recent incidents how have we individually approached them what is the view / culture of the division.<br />Where and who do we need to progess and how are we going to have a structured approach to it.
1,11663,2292,11573,10 Months:<br />To review the impact of the implemenation of the critical incident policy on North Manchester and the force with a view to assessing impact and improvement
1,11664,2318,11611,Ring Shabir Abdul and ask him what he thinks, as a member of the Police Authority.<br />Ring Alan Green and ask him the same.
1,11665,2335,11584,10 days<br />-Reflect why held this session<br />- make some notes about the sessions, aims ad objectives, outcomes<br />10 wks- Feedback to the GMPA<br />- obtain comment/response to the feedback from members<br />10 months - Ask the Chief about how the lessons from today are being translated in to action, any changes/difference being made. Has there been any any concerns or suggestions in taking lessons from today<br />Suggest - GMPA consider this exercise!
1,11666,2332,11617,10 weeks: Implement the improvements that I have determined and seek help in establishing further potential areas of improvement.
1,11667,2297,11569,10 Days: Reflect - What have I learnt from today about myself, my colleagues and the organisation especially in respect of Race. How will I address the issue of raising the question of race in a truely honest and open way without fear of causing offence.<br />How can I stimulate honest and open debate.<br />How can I be certain that I will deal with those issues once identified in a fair and equitable manner.<br />How can I influence others to do the same and make surethat they deliver on this.<br />What checks can I put in place to ensure that I am delivering on all of the above
1,11668,2316,11586,10 weeks<br />As I now run the force policy unit - I will consider if the appropiate guidance is appropiate for the task and whether it needs revising. As I am scoping the whole of force policy I will have to prioritise - however this day has certainly raised critical incident guidance up the list.<br />Linked to this issue is the role of Independent Advisory Groups - do we use them effectively or are they just another tick box - I may do some analysis in conjunction with diversity command. At present we are rationalising strategic groups are these just token groups - how do they affect performance
1,11669,2299,11574,Ten weeks:<br />Actively seek colleagues from different backgrounds than myself and have honest conversations whereby I could check my perception as to what their experience in this organisation has been like. The challenge would be in building the right relationship that enables honesty, openness, respect and trust.
1,11670,2306,11593,10 Weeks:<br />Get some discussion going around the issues - sort out some sort of mechanism for dealing with any potential incident fairly and professionally within a diversity context.
1,11671,2325,11581,over the next 10 days I will be continue to do my best in my role in support of all Police Staff in GMP and will possibly enter into discussions on the possible effect on Police Staff of the reduced budget and in the hope that it will not be a critical incident.
1,11672,2312,11577,3) I dentify and link causes to critical incidents(in my area of work) and circulate disseminate any learning to force.<br />4) Look at management information provided to force to identify what, if any improvements can be mde to assist in the identification of behaviour either individually or by area that may result in critical incidents
1,11673,2315,11595,10 weeks - Become actively involved in supporting the Diversity Command and not focusing on my own &#039;silo&#039;. Doing this in such a way that supports and does not interfere.
1,11674,2324,11599,10 WEEKS<br />Over the following 10 weeks I feel I would be more alert to the issues that I understand to fall under the label of diversity without having to make an effort to think about it.
1,11675,2303,11588,10 day<br />Review current operations for their impact binternally / externally - what is transferable from today?
1,11676,2336,11604,10 weeks - I would reflect on these issues and any personal issues or fears I might have in dealing with a critical incident and seek advice and share best practice from colleagues.
1,11677,2301,11594,10 months - To be in a position whereby we can tangibly measure some degree of success in the way we approach and deal with issues of race - we might do this by benchmarking where we are now and where we are in 10 months
1,11678,2313,11591,Within 10 days I will have taken the time to review my own handling of internal critical incidents to date in the light of today&#039;s discussion and identified issues for further work.<br />As I am currently involved in handling a race related staff issue I will within 10 weeks have reviewed the process with the team with a view to positive learning and culture change.<br />Within 10 months I will use my experience as a new recruit to GMP to inform my understanding and the understanding of the organisation of how inclusive the culture is and how much it welcomes diversity/expects assimilation.
1,11679,2329,11575,10 Days<br />Personal reflection on what the day meant.  Discussion with Senior Leaders in the Branch regarding our approach to Diversity and what the day was about and implications on a personal and professional delivery level.
1,11680,2320,11601,10 days<br />I will ask for /examine in more detail data in respect of investigation of complaints in relation to BEM groups within GMP.How are BEM staff progressing through for instance the promotion system ?<br />10 WEEKS<br />I will have reviewed our Diversity Action Plan as a whole but in particular  to see if we are capturing potential critical incidents in relation to diversity issues.<br />10 months<br />I will have reviewed and implemented amore effective internal communication strategy to adddress the issue of diversity on my bcu
1,11681,2294,11571,10 - months: Assess whether the task(s)/intervention(s) completed and evaluate effectiveness via discussion with appropriate persons within GMP [NB: AG may/will have left and would probably no longer be the appropriate person.]
1,11682,2293,11606,Ten months-To further look at involving myself in learning to resolve critical incidents, but also to look at assisting colleagues and those other officers in the Division. I previously led on a program of training at my former division which encouraged managers to take responsibilty and to deal with potential incidents. I would look at doing that again.
1,11683,2333,11589,10 weeks - Discuss with staff, particularly in areas where the norm is towards secrecy and protection of life, how openness can be encouraged and willingness to identify and discuss organisational and personal responses which will minimise the risk of critical incidents as a result of action or inaction.
1,11684,2335,11579,10 days - I will have met with members of the GMPA re a stop search information campaign we are taking to the public. This is already pre-set. I am now conscious that during previous planning meetings we have discussed all manner of issues around stop search and not ONCE referred to race or racism. I intend to raise this issue constructively for a meaningful discussion before we go public.
1,11685,2312,11577,10 months<br />1) review work completed have we identified anything?<br />2) what feedback has been obtained.<br />3) what have i done to improve understanding of staff? has it had any tangable improvement.
1,11686,2317,11597,In 10 months if I am still here, I will have encouraged the team to look outside of the traditional routes, the tried and tested methods. Have a network of advisers that the team are comfortable contacting in for help with critical incidents.
1,11687,2334,11600,10 weeks.<br />I will seek to ensure that the revised approach is discussed and shared with my team and that we discuss how our own individual approaches and attitudes to race and diversity are impacting on HR systems, processes and outcomes within GMP
1,11688,2332,11617,10 months: Review the process; what has worked and what has not. Consult others and try to determine further change.
1,11689,2307,11603,10 months over the next ten months continue to complete my theses which is around the impact of diversity training on black females within GMP anthesisd present the relevant findings to the oganisation to make the relevant changes to create an inclusive environment. Blend some of the learning from today into that thesis and try and bring out the positives from the learning.

1,11692,2326,11582,10 months - to still care about GMP and help if asked (but not as a consultant).  Success could mean I won&#039;t be asked - that would be great.  To take the lessons into whatever I do in my future be it in a work or private life environment.
1,11693,2296,11587,10 months:Given the internal impacts on the external, have in place not just compliance by systems but openess within the divsion to discuss those impacts / attitudes and consequences. If fear exists break down the silence it causes.
1,11694,2329,11575,Ten Weeks<br />Consider how we ensure that issues of proportionality are considered in future technology provision - e.g. considering issues of proportionality in all encounters and how we report on these.  Seek to include within revised management information framework.
1,11695,2335,11579,10 weeks - within ten weeks the stop search awareness campaign will have been rolled out. I intend to make at least one road show in person to discuss all aspects of stop search with members of the public and address issues of race and racism openly, honestly and directly.
1,11696,2312,11625,10 weeks<br />5) discuss any findings with other pertinent groups i.e. diversity command
1,11697,2316,11586,10 months<br />Reflect over last 10 months on the critical incidents - have I dealt with them differently - document.<br />Complete the review of IAG&#039;s interactions and force guidance in relation to critical incidents.
1,11698,2306,11593,10 months<br />Conduct an &quot;open forum&quot; review of all internal CIs within the last 10 months from the perspective of as many of those involved as possible - looking at positives, negatives and what we can do to improve.
1,11699,2310,11590,10 months<br />1. Reflect on how I have personally dealt with any such incidents and seek critical review of the peformance.
1,11700,2336,11604,10 Months - In the time scale of getting to this stage I hoped to achieve knowledge and gained leadership skills in how to deal with and be actively involved with a critical incident. From this I hope it would get me a ticket to the champagne reception !

1,11702,2328,11607,.
1,11703,2297,11569,10 Months<br />What has changed<br />Have I changed<br />Is GMP a better place<br />Where do I go from here<br />How can I take this further
1,11704,2324,11599,10 MONTHS<br />I will try to ensure that people with whom I come into contact with either in the work or social sphere feel comfortable to discuss any concerns they have, particularly of a diverse nature, with me and that I will be able to listen, understand and advise if necessary.<br />I will try to see it from their point of view and the point of view of others rather than from my own experience and understanding.<br />I can&#039;t see myself taking any major action.
1,11705,2315,11595,10 months - Undertake either formally or informally a 360 degree feedback process to establish what I am actually contibuting as opposed to what I think I am contributing and ensuring that this covers individuals both internally and externally.  Particularly making sure that this is taking place accross a broad base and not just in narrow areas that I have direct control over.

Confer in the construction of this with a strategically placed group of critical friends.
1,11708,2299,11574,Ten Months:<br />Identify a person from the group with whom I engaged at the ten week point who I could develop a longer lasting and deeper reaching relationship to act as mentor or coach. This would be a person who I could ask those questions which would be otherwise unasked. Experienced decision makers make better decsions: as my personal experience is mainly based in an English, white, heterosexual culture, my future decisions within critical incidents which might have a racial or other diversity related element, will be better.
1,11709,2335,11579,10 months - As stop search champion for the division, I will present the stop search data to series of different meetings colleagues on the Division to explore the findings and address issues of race and racism directly and openly with them to obtain their feedback and provide a forum for this issue to be discussed with a senior manager outside the &#039;usual&#039; fora for such issues to be discussed.
1,11710,2298,11592,10 months: As from the beginning of the 10 day period offer mentoring support to ALL gMP staff, as well as offer to work across GMP with the ultimate goal to minimise racist behaviour, challenging and prevention to achieve fairness and equitable respect.

1,11720,2298,11592,10 weeks: Evaluate the outcomes and review previous and current mechansms in place. Identify the possible lack of affirmative support and actions and introduce aan accountable process amongst every level of management across every department. This may entail recognising &quot;failures&quot; and successes, praise and share bad and good practices
1,11721,2310,11590,As an alternative I may not attend the function as the ticket will be worth a fortune on E bay
1,11722,2295,11602,10 Days:<br />Consider whether I and others are concerned, even frightened, to discuss and address confidently matters pertaining to Race and Diversity and open discussions with my Senior Team and Branch DAG to this effect.<br />10 Weeks:<br />As a Branch Senior Team to consider the means by which we may upskill personnel in Branch and other learners in Force to a) recognise potential critical incidents and b) be confident to make judgements and deal with same as they arise; this through inclusion in the Branch business plan, consultation with the Branch IAG and DAG forums and through plans to mainstream Critical Incident recognition and responses in all learning activities which fall within the Branch remit.<br />Consider and decide at this stage evaluation mechanisms to assess efectiveness or difference.<br />10 Months:<br />Undertake assessment and evaluation as initially prescribed at the 10 week stage and, from the results, decide whether I dare go to the party!

1,11724,2325,11581,In the next 10 months I would like to undertake several road shows throughout the force in order to give the members the oportunity to express their views.
1,11725,2337,11576,10days - spend time reflecting on the days learning. What did I learn? What did I do and say and what did I avoid doing and saying? What were the reasons for this? How can I challenge my perspectives and views?<br />10 Weeks - Discuss with Divisional Command Team how robust the division is at dealing with race and critical incidents. Are the correct controls, measures and lines of communication in place to ensure the division is embracing the issue. Become involved in developing new policy and DAG.<br />10 months - Put systems in place that ensure the division is managing incidents correctly and at an early stage. Through a clear communication strategy and leading by example ensure that staff understand why we must promote good practice in race and diversity issues - this ensures that the culture becomes embeded and is sustainable as people buy into the concept

1,11804,2395,11787,we are highly successful at this and is a key element of this club and what it stands for
1,11805,2407,11798,this is the most pressing issue - no-one can plan without any security or discussion on this topic - to negotiate you need a fall back position
1,11806,2394,11797,about the players available to the coaches
1,11807,2397,11798,AGM covered early promising results
1,11808,2402,11798,agreed, if the club is to continue to grow should we just look for a larger ground
1,11809,2410,11789,Do we know timing of decision and likely financial cost to rugby club?
1,11810,2411,11783,I think that kent cup / plate should be used as a potential platform for encouraging players to join the club. Players of a higher standard than what they currently play in the lower leagues (london 2/3/4) could easily be recruited to come play at a higher standard RE; Old Colfes
1,11811,2407,11800,leather sellers? Is that a possibility?
1,11812,2388,11793,Are you suprised there is no one in the bar? Its a club bar with pub prices.
1,11813,2393,11786,Drawing spectators/new players??
1,11814,2387,11786,Surely nothing can be done here until new lease is confirmed or not. So we will have to wait until confirmation - When will this be?
1,11815,2396,11797,What does falling away mean? is it realistic to expect old boys from the school plus some mates to compete in London 1
1,11816,2410,11789,Have we approached school re sharing their facilities or to share ours and share in cost?
1,11817,2390,11797,must remember all teams, the 1st must not be the only focus of attention
1,11818,2400,11797,we must not concentrate on just the last 2/3 seasons
1,11819,2414,11796,are we actively seeking new finanancial support and if so does this not go hand in hand with sponsorship
1,11820,2393,11790,Women&#039;s rugby
1,11821,2395,11797,we need to look at why members of this club feel that sevenoaks is a huge away trip and hence make themselves NA
1,11822,2394,11783,do we play players
1,11823,2411,11815,yes because you got here in the first place
1,11824,2417,11783,instead of word of mouth can we advertise in local papers for players
1,11825,2407,11792,Lewisham council? Are we the only rugby club in Lewisham? If so we have no competiition and this must be a plus point - why are we receiving awards form Greenwich?
1,11826,2394,11822,do we pay players...sorry
1,11827,2400,11797,we must be realistic about what we can achieve over the long term
1,11828,2410,11791,Do we understand consequences of school moving towards 50/50 boy girl ratio?
1,11829,2392,11784,why do many players at the end of their playing careers stop being involved in the club?
1,11830,2415,11812,that is not the choice of the rugby club and does not affect the spirit of the rugby club members
1,11831,2413,11784,how do we retain minis when they go to work/uni
1,11832,2396,11808,There is no need for a bigger ground - 2 pitches should be enough
1,11833,2391,11783,can we encourage more local residents to see the club as &#039;for them&#039; so they come and join
1,11834,2393,11797,Finding a level where rugby is enjoyed
1,11835,2394,11822,should we be a feeder club to Blackheath?
1,11836,2395,11823,but we were lucky to have 22 players that hit their peak at the same time will we have that again
1,11837,2400,11826,no
1,11838,2397,11783,What about web site enquiries?
1,11839,2414,11783,we certainly need to attract new players. to do this we need to offer incentives
1,11840,2404,11812,not relevant to club spirit
1,11841,2400,11835,do they want us to be ?
1,11842,2394,11822,what happened to the meetings with the player coach at Blackheath...four players were supposed to come down.
1,11843,2387,11797,This sort of club is always going to go in peaks and troughs. Especially if we do not pay players - which I don&#039;t think we should.
1,11844,2400,11835,what is a feeder club ?
1,11845,2411,11827,realistically I think we should be competing in london 1 and challenging for some silverware in perhaps the kent cup
1,11846,2407,11783,possibility of dropping the &#039;old&#039; in old colfeian - it implies that we are closed and must be an ex member of the school and resticts opportunity for lottery funding etc.
1,11847,2394,11797,all about training at the top end of the club...need more players training
1,11848,2397,11797,Set objectives
1,11849,2410,11785,We should determine what balance is between league position and values of club.
1,11850,2417,11788,whilst players enjoy playing some of us just really enjoy being spectators
1,11851,2388,11783,Will you get the players we need to stay in London 1 without banding money about?
1,11852,2400,11814,we must always try to improve
1,11853,2407,11846,eg Dartfordians used to be &#039;old&#039;
1,11854,2411,11835,no
1,11855,2404,11808,no way, the spiit of the club is at Horn Park
1,11856,2397,11783,Paying players can be at many different levels - the cricket club can manage it on a more limited budget - advantages and limitations
1,11857,2409,11832,We already need at least 3 pitches, because of the number of mini &amp; youth teams
1,11858,2414,11791,there needs to be a designated member of the committee to be the club&#039;s link to the school
1,11859,2393,11833,Varying social events
1,11860,2415,11797,all the club can do is help the players achieve the best of thier abiliaty, with good coaching for all sides.
1,11861,2390,11840,I would think that the profit made from the bar means subscriptions would have to increase
1,11862,2411,11835,advertising has rarely worked unless we&#039;re willing to pay players - which we&#039;re not
1,11863,2393,11838,What about a website?
1,11864,2396,11851,Why is there a need to stay in London 1 at all costs?
1,11865,2388,11797,Lack of transparency with regards to selection discourages people from training.
1,11866,2400,11846,and Askeans used to be a decent club !
1,11867,2391,11796,Whatever the rugby club does we are still in the hands of the CSC and the contributions to it from the other sports sections - or rather the lack of them. Other sections can sometimes feel like a millstone rather than a benefit.
1,11868,2408,11783,what about having a development officer - part-time and mabe paid - whose task would be to recruit from local colleges etc and keep in touch with the rugby boys when they leave school?
1,11869,2395,11863,we have a very good website
1,11870,2407,11792,lottery funding - the name old colfeins implies a closed club  - must be seen as more open to the community
1,11871,2387,11792,We must find ways of increasing sponsorship/advertising money to put back into the club - Richmond for example, and I am not saying we can get the same amounts, earnt &pound;250,000 in sponsorship advertising.
1,11872,2397,11846,Lot of people outside think that they can&#039;t apply!
1,11873,2410,11790,With challenges we have is it realistic to add another dimension particularly given our female facilities.
1,11874,2394,11817,yes but it is important to draw new players by having a successful 1st xv
1,11875,2400,11824,its been tried
1,11876,2387,11828,It&#039;s already 50/50 isn&#039;t it?
1,11877,2394,11836,we can have that again
1,11878,2391,11783,Does the CASC status the CSC has applied for - Community Amateur Sports Club - mean we couldn&#039;t pay players even if we wanted to?
1,11879,2390,11826,definatly not
1,11880,2411,11867,then why not breakaway - is it essential we are linked to CSC?
1,11881,2404,11857,additional space can be found for playing, but the home of the club should remain where it is for everyone to come back to and meet up.<br />What we need to do is provide a much better service in terms of food and entertainment to keep us all at the club for longer
1,11882,2388,11786,If we keep the ground, what will be done about a delapidating club house?
1,11883,2419,11852,bland statement how can we improve
1,11884,2387,11858,There already is. It is Haggis. Not sure what he does to improve the link.
1,11885,2400,11858,I thought there was
1,11886,2390,11863,It is good but mant of the pages are out of date which is dissapointing
1,11887,2404,11816,yes, some discussions are taking place
1,11888,2415,11826,never
1,11889,2395,11877,how
1,11890,2400,11804,Do not under rate its importance to the club
1,11891,2407,11814,totally agree - no tenant can be expected to improve facilties with no certainty of lease
1,11892,2408,11878,probably yes, we couldn&#039;t pay, but we can pay for coaching
1,11893,2396,11858,A big challenge is the 3 years that 18 year olds disappear off to University, we need a strategy to maintain contact with school leavers over these 3-4 years
1,11894,2397,11791,School is a great source of talent, but cannot be relied upon solely as the bedrock of a competitive club - must look outside
1,11895,2415,11824,in papers and rubgy world
1,11896,2411,11783,we cant pay players at present so stop talking about it :)
1,11897,2394,11836,it wasn&#039;t luck...it was hard work...it took 5 seasons to get to that point. I think people expect to get there without the work. Young players think that they are owed their position in the leagues. They owe it to the club to stay high in the leagues.
1,11898,2388,11784,Below 1st XV level there is never one captain from one week to the next.
1,11899,2417,11786,surely hot showers should be a necessity not luxury
1,11900,2400,11849,??????????
1,11901,2404,11873,yes, we owe it to the girls leaving the school, and if we had girls playing hockey, rugby, netball dow here there would be less need to go up to the village to meet girls
1,11902,2398,11797,for this club to survive we need to strenghten both the playing staff and the coaching staff.  Canterbury have a five year plan with generous sponsorship to attract players - look what they have achieved this season.  No 2nd XV bothering to train means no pressure on 1st XV players - do we want to be a social club or one with real ambition.
1,11903,2414,11797,we don&#039;t have the facilities to be able to cope with 40 players training
1,11904,2416,11783,do we advertise more/
1,11905,2397,11893,if they ever come back - might go anywhere - want people moving into the area
1,11906,2387,11826,Agreed, not the direction we want to take. Eventually it will become a serious drain on finances. What would we gain out of it in the long term?
1,11907,2392,11784,Why are Westcombe Park so much more succesful as a club - apart from paying players - what is the model for their success?
1,11908,2407,11882,this bowls club house is quite nice???
1,11909,2391,11783,What about keeping older players as members and involved after they finish playing? If Sidcup and W Park have successful events like dinner dances because they have so many older members and alicadoos perhaps we ought to put as much effort in to retaining our members as recruiting new ones. We have 100 player mebers a year and only 65 former players as members. What can the club do to retain their interest and support and involvement?
1,11910,2410,11880,Could we sell ground and share Leathersellers facilities?
1,11911,2400,11896,who said we can&#039;t
1,11912,2395,11826,no it should not be entertained
1,11913,2411,11788,players must be allowed to enjoy playing rugby at all standards - and consequently should have a say in what team they play in
1,11914,2393,11826,It would ruin the club - a team built out of people who are here just for the money and not because their friends/family play here!
1,11915,2397,11794,Lewisham and Greenwich very promising - in cricket we have district committees sitting above the clubs
1,11916,2404,11893,having the kids playing in our minis for 10 years and more, will build the loyalty in the kids well before they go off to uni, therby making it more likely that they come back to us.
1,11917,2397,11886,web site wont be found unless it is regularly updated with good content
1,11918,2391,11796,We often hear the sad news of old members and former players passing away. Can we encourage people to put just a little bit to the club in their will?
1,11919,2390,11795,a vital part of why the club is what it is, people still make a point of maintaining contact with each other, does this happen at Blackheath, Westcombe Park, etc. Is it why they comment on us in the way they do
1,11920,2396,11871,There is no reason why we can&#039;t organise a good profitable dinner/evening - Previous bad experience shoudn&#039;t be a reason not to try again
1,11921,2415,11896,It would ruin the attmosphere of the club, as it has at many other clubs.
1,11922,2392,11898,If general apathy sets in then this is what the club will be known for and we will always struggle to attract the quality of player we want and need.
1,11923,2400,11872,a lot ?
1,11924,2395,11898,this is not necessarily true the captains are there they just haven&#039;t been available
1,11925,2387,11842,Blackheath hadan unforseen amount of injuries - 20 1st team players - just before christmas which meant Harvey Biljon (Blackheath player/coach) would not release any players. Conversations continue between OCRFC and Harvey Biljon
1,11926,2407,11792,events such as dinner dances are fantastic opportunites but must be fun and in house - why have dinner dances in Swanley? A marquee on the pitches is much more profitable and keeps funds in house....
1,11927,2414,11792,i&#039;m constantly hearing about how successful old school boys are in their jobs,can we not tap into this as a resource
1,11928,2410,11907,Do we really understand what they have done thats different? Could we ask them to allow one of committee to be silent observer so we can properly understand their success?
1,11929,2400,11895,that has also been tried
1,11930,2398,11903,that is a ridiculous comment - W Park and Blackheath manage it - as a coach I would love to work with those numbers
1,11931,2395,11907,They are only successful in the first team we are better at 2nd and 3rd team level
1,11932,2415,11836,Yes but you still need the right players to work with.
1,11933,2407,11786,other facitities - tennis for the ladies and all ? encourages more memebers and more diversity
1,11934,2397,11878,No, you can pay them to coach, but not to play - so write your contracts appropriately :-)
1,11935,2404,11894,lets keep it to friends of friends rather than recruiting for players. Otherwise our spirit will be changed fo ever. If I wanted that I&#039;d go to Blackheath!!
1,11936,2393,11786,Promoting the facilities to city firms.
1,11937,2387,11872,How do we know this - where is the evidence?
1,11938,2408,11803,can wenot have use of the school pitches - perhaps do a deal with them?
1,11939,2413,11797,How do we make training &quot;fun&quot; for the less able players that they don&#039;t feel they are just cannon fodder for the firsts
1,11940,2417,11783,mini&#039;s- other schools in area could be advised of old colfeans as a lot of local schools say in Blackfen are already involved with Sidcup
2,11941,0,0,Values, what are they for our club?
1,11942,2394,11893,what about links to greenwich university?
1,11943,2387,11846,Old Patesians don&#039;t have any obvious problems
1,11944,2397,11927,school has a directory of members which tells you how successful they are and where they work
1,11945,2388,11786,Events are limited at the club because of the state of it.
1,11946,2393,11793,Create a visual identity. Sponsored leisurewear/playing kit/matchday tracksuits
1,11947,2408,11801,it could be by the end of the year, but it might go almost up to hte wire in 2009
1,11948,2391,11791,The school charges all parents for their kids to be life members of the CSC, yet there are no sports facilities for women so won&#039;t they feel hard done by when they see they are members of a club that has nothing for them? Doesn&#039;t this give the school and the Governors an obligation to do more to support the school so we can develop facilities for female sport?
1,11949,2404,11894,The minis will create a 2nd stream of colfeians even though they may never have gone to colfes as about half the minis are at other schools
1,11950,2411,11897,this goes back to recruiting the right players who are willing to train regardless of work/girlfriend/wives commitments
1,11951,2410,11824,Can we approach local scool senior sides that dont have obvious old boys or senior club connection?i
1,11952,2398,11847,they dont train because they have no ambition
2,11953,0,0,What would make for a great club night and bring in the money?
1,11954,2393,11926,Good idea!!
1,11955,2414,11935,the club may suffer if it is a closed shop there are many comments to that affect already
1,11956,2407,11893,regular contact is a great idea - e-mail lists should not be too difficualt to achieve
1,11957,2397,11792,Easy to spend a lot of effort on events which only raise a few hundred quid. Better to concentrate on projects which raise at least &pound;10k
1,11958,2388,11784,If there is a worry about 2010 what are we doing about looking around for other facilities?
1,11959,2414,11939,for that you need a larger coaching set up/space
1,11960,2411,11903,agreed thats a shocking comment - i&#039;d love to train with 39 players and the facilities are more than adequate to manage it
1,11961,2396,11939,This is a highly valid comment especially for Thursdays - When more than 20 turn up - so B4 November
1,11962,2397,11811,No, it&#039;s the main school sports ground now
1,11963,2394,11793,Each generation develops their own identity but I think that what is missing is the cavalier spirit that I associate with being a colfeian. Teams such as the 4th team and vets play in different kit...?????
1,11964,2393,11953,Beer and curry simple!! Indian Nights!!
1,11965,2402,11953,the funky chicks!
1,11966,2387,11795,ery important and this is one way to keep people coming down to the club both while playing and not playing.
1,11967,2404,11826,never ever ever
1,11968,2407,11953,we are a rugby club - ergo we have lots of males - ergo why not events such as speed dating, gentlemens eveneing etc.
1,11969,2409,11783,The minis and youth just pay subs but are not members of the Club. They should be encouraged to join early - poss include membership in subs and give membership card. This is a resource we are mising.
1,11970,2391,11792,Unlike Richmond and London Scottish we can&#039;t attract people to events at the club in the company of former international players so they are keen to book tables and invite their friends and work colleagues/contacts
1,11971,2388,11785,If you play against semi professional sides this is will what happen. There are not many people who will play for free when they can get paid elsewhere.
1,11972,2415,11884,We have contact with the last year of school who will be leaving this year, some already play at the club. The club also has contact with old members of the school who are currently at university, some play when they return for holiday. However more could and should be done.
1,11973,2394,11793,Yes...the club!!! not just different teams like the 4&#039;s and vets who are like seperate entities.
1,11974,2410,11804,Should we subsidise tours for key players at university to encourage them back to the club?
1,11975,2397,11831,If they have a history of playing here for many years it will be easier than if they have&#039;t ever played here, so should get better
1,11976,2396,11967,Never never
1,11977,2400,11950,these are the same choices as there always have been
1,11978,2397,11829,Because they stop when they are busiest at work, probably
1,11979,2400,11889,I think thats why we are here
1,11980,2411,11931,thats true - from what i&#039;ve heard there is no team spirit amongst them
1,11981,2418,11965,ok fair enough but how do we make the nights fun for them?
1,11982,2397,11873,Can get loads of funding for girls sport
1,11983,2395,11920,totally agree but we need support outside of the players
1,11984,2387,11897,What constitutes a young player? 28 young or is 19 young? I don&#039;t think anyone takes it for granted, but some more hard work is absolutely neccessary.
1,11985,2404,11835,No way, we are a social rugby club that plays at the level the membership is able to, fun 1st, rugby 2nd. Blackheath is a rugby club trying to play at the highest level where rugb is number 1,2,3,and 4
1,11986,2394,11793,concerned about the lack of youngsters who believe in the spirit of the club...that takes time and investment and commitment.
1,11987,2398,11939,have you ever been to a training session - if you had been you would know that is never geared to the elite.
1,11988,2391,11792,Local firms perceive the club to be the exclusive reserve of people who used to go to a fee paying school, so wonder why the hell should they put their hands in their pockets to subsidise a club of &quot;well-off toffs&quot; who can probably afford all their own beer etc themselves?
1,11989,2390,11907,I do not think they are as successful as is thought talking to them the 1st team are very much a club within a club
1,11990,2393,11784,Using children from the school/local youth clubs as ball boys and girls
1,11991,2407,11915,surely within a london borough with 2012 Olympics looming there are funds to be tapped into and councils willing and eager to sponsor succesful clubs in their area?
1,11992,2411,11965,its been proposed we have a poker night with some alternative entertainment, have tried to organise this but with little success
1,11993,2404,11951,most school players are aligned with a minis section at a club already, which is why our own minis are so important
1,11994,2387,11817,Agreed but the lower sides also need to get more involved socially, training, development of the club
1,11995,2404,11833,this should be done with flyers and direct mailing, maybe even telecanvessing or knocking on the door
1,11996,2394,11965,more attractive bar staff
1,11997,2400,11907,its only the money and the good time supporters that some success attract
1,11998,2407,11842,waste of time and effort - they never have and never will seek to assisit local clubs - always a one way street
1,11999,2395,11816,what are they lets hear them
1,12000,2402,11981,the bar needs to be more comfortable, more family friendly for sundays that now appear to be a good opportunity to raise revenue and support
1,12001,2411,11886,one person cannot be expected to write articles / match reports etc as well as uploading the data its all time consuming - its always been the case that if someone writes an article it will be posted
1,12002,2414,11944,that&#039;s great but is there anybody tapping into this resource. i know the school is so should the club not be aswell
1,12003,2387,11847,No ambition or do they just not like training.
1,12004,2416,11791,necessity for keeping closer ties with players at college and university
1,12005,2411,11886,its about getting several players from each team to throw there 2pence at it and write articles
1,12006,2395,11820,why do we want women at the club
1,12007,2404,11839,no we dont and no we shouldn&#039;t, we are a club for friends to meet and play rugby, not to attract people for no other reason than because they are good at rugby
1,12008,2407,11951,invite the coaches and 1st team cpatains of the local rugby playing schools to the club suppoer of other events???
1,12009,2396,11987,Pretty much every Tuesday &amp; Thursday for about 6 years &amp; I&#039;m sorry but Thursdays are
1,12010,2403,11783,to expect a benefit in the senior club from a successful mini section does not always follow.  Not many current Blackheath 1st team players have come through their mini and junior section.  In fact it would be interesting to see if many of their players are from local schools.
1,12011,2387,11941,Proud
2,12012,0,0,Committee structure
1,12013,2397,11935,you could always try making new friends!
1,12014,2411,11953,more music nights has been proposed but the reason the night has proved so successful is because people haven&#039;t become bored of it by having one monthly - its essentially the same night and we shouldn&#039;t overdo it
1,12015,2410,11900,If we continued in national leagues would spirit of being an old boys club be able to survive?
1,12016,2394,11793,When I joined I felt like I had to step up in order to maintain the level of playing...I think that young players are arrogant and do not appreciate the history of the club and what players have achieved before them.
1,12017,2415,11893,Contact details for the leavers are kept, however we need to remember that it is only a small percentage of people that continue to play rugby after they leave university. Beer, women and work get in the way.
1,12018,2391,11792,Full income from sponsorship includes companies that sponsor the club in exchange for some international tickets at Twickenham, and advertising space in the match programmes. Each season it amounts to about &pound;13,000-&pound;15,000. A big issue is that we are not &#039;the local town side&#039;, and can&#039;t confer any/much local prestige on our sposnors and advertisers for their support. Even the likes of Sidcup in a lower league can do this better than us under the name of Old Colfeians. But then how much is that part of the spirit of the club?
1,12019,2404,11872,good, its good for us to keep a degree of exclusivity and yet benefit from the financial benefits in terms of rate rebates, casc status and grants that being open brings
1,12020,2408,11797,if there is still going to be two or three years before the lease is sorted, what are the small improvements that we could make in the interim which would be welcome?
1,12021,2387,11953,A very well run summer ball or party somewhere in the local vicinity at a venue where people actually want to go to, including the funky chicks
1,12022,2402,11965,these are all suggestions to keep a male club. All succesfull clubs have encourage the family.
1,12023,2397,11786,Most colfes school leavers are now interested in fitness training, martial arts, badminton and tennis, according to their membership applications!
1,12024,2395,12009,i disagree if the numbers are there then the &quot;elite&quot; can play against the &quot;Non elite&quot;
1,12025,2411,11953,summer ball has been tried and it fell on its face -events MUST be run during the season when people can be made more aware of it
1,12026,2400,11952,ambition fro what
1,12027,2411,12012,nope you got me? anyone got any ideas?
1,12028,2405,11785,Do we place too much emphasis on the success of the 1st XV?   In other words have we become elitist?
1,12029,2393,12006,Would generate more money behind the bar.
1,12030,2402,12021,the school can organise a summer ball, can&#039;t we copy the format and even tap the same market?
1,12031,2394,11971,there are brilliant players out there who want to play for fun...what I believe is that we have to attract them to the fun aspect. Look at Hyder or Andy Baker, James Rutter?
1,12032,2404,11864,quite right, I dont care if we are in Kent 3, if we are runing 5 sides, have three music nights, a burns night, a thriving minis, etc etc etc.<br />People come first, not the ego of saying we are in London 1
1,12033,2414,11822,i think that is a very short sighted view. the club has to think about it&#039;s survival and it should consider this as an option. the professional game will get bigger and bigger and we must be on the train in one capacity or another.
1,12034,2397,11940,we have list of greenwich and lewisham schools, plenty in se12 and se9 to recruit from - no shortage of kids, more than enough to go round
1,12035,2409,12005,Is there a coordinator for managers/players etc to pass on info to?
1,12036,2404,11856,and they have people knocking each others teetch out at club suppers
1,12037,2393,12006,Would generate interest from the local community.
1,12038,2387,11915,Great more red tape and long drawn out committee meetings that don&#039;t achieve anything. To a club (rugby club) like this that is on the whole well run we need direct financial support not another pseudo governing body telling us what to do.
1,12039,2408,11783,We should market ourselves more agressively, so that people know us as afriendly, attractive, traditional club. Use the RFU, Google and the Press.
1,12040,2391,11783,Match reports are hardly ever in my local paper in Greenwich. If we want more members (and more programme advertisers and sponsors) it might help if more people in the local area had a chance to read about us.
1,12041,2417,11785,when we were in the 3 south league both the players and the alacadoos were much happier and much more positive
1,12042,2392,11957,Yes exactly - set the sights higher. There must be huge potential for coprorate sponsorship provided it is approached in a professional manner.
1,12043,2394,11783,We can attract talented players by simply being a fun club...playing cavalier rugby
1,12044,2407,11953,re- vamp the club supper - ther eis only so much steak and kidney pie a man can eat in a badminton hall - invite other reps. from schools, universities, etc. to it, make it enjoyable and fun and use it as a recruting instrument.
1,12045,2397,12031,Have you thought of offering modest scholarships to promising school-leavers who need to raise money to go to uni? Good way of tying them in, and it it&#039;s fun here, they will likely stay
1,12046,2402,12016,thats a problem with any youth, but, is that the right attitude to encourage them
1,12047,2395,12022,But we hold events that could involve the family/wifes and its always the same people turn up
1,12048,2403,11785,the amateur approach is definitely the right approach.  But he consquences are that OC&#039;s will be a yo-yo side.  Relegated one year and promoted the next.
1,12049,2415,12005,yes, any information can be passed to our web co-ordinator and it will be put on the web.
1,12050,2414,12031,these are becoming few and far between we need to change with them
1,12051,2393,12006,My wife would insist on picking me up on a Saturday evening instead of me begging for a lift home!!!!
1,12052,2390,11789,The overall position and way in which the complete club is organised and run has a major effect on what the Rugby Club should do. We always seem to get this item pushed away, it is partly why you hear comments about breaking away and doing our own thing
1,12053,2404,11909,top comment, they used to join the bowles club, maybe we need to look at something for them to get into when they are 40 something
1,12054,2397,11907,it&#039;s a community!
1,12055,2392,11988,In that case the image needs to be changed in the local market, that is about selling ourselves properly and professionally
1,12056,2391,11953,A midweek (or Friday) club lunch for members and guests. Sell tables for people (the sort of people with business expenses) to bring guests to hear a chat between John Gallagher and Ben Clarke about latest rugby events and news
1,12057,2395,12044,im not sure what ideas have you got as the organiser of this event lets hear it
1,12058,2388,11785,Success I feel comes from the top down. However emphasis on the 1st XV should not mean neglect of other sides.
1,12059,2415,11967,never never never
1,12060,2409,11893,Best thing we can do is to tie in the younger players who are not yet members
1,12061,2393,11992,Entertainment committee
1,12062,2410,12012,Should get committee to do self apparaisal of whats worked and not worked over last ten years. Also see if it is consistent with what regular players perceive of club and committee.
1,12063,2404,11969,this is happening now
1,12064,2398,11903,they have NO ambition.
1,12065,2414,12060,the minis will grow and grow and so this will help with members later
1,12066,2407,11940,and even easier for us as they have no grounds to play on!!!
1,12067,2404,12010,of course no, they pay players and force their minis out, we will never do that
1,12068,2413,11796,If there is a problem with the rest of the club/CSC should the whole club be run by the rugby section?
1,12069,2415,11864,completly agree, no need to be any particular league, just inportant to keep the spirit of the club.
1,12070,2416,11797,greater dress code is required to maintain playing standards
1,12071,2418,11826,ok so you don&#039;t want to pay, so now what? What&#039;s to be done to get more players?
1,12072,2397,11826,If you&#039;re serious about a complete review of everything, you should not rule this out at the first stage
1,12073,2390,12040,This along with many other jobs required by the club needs someone to put there name forward. We can not expect the same people todo everything
1,12074,2407,11969,does membership of the club enable to participate in other sports eg squash - I have no idea?
1,12075,2387,12048,Exactly just accept that we will peak and trough if we stay as an amateur club. It should not come as a suprise
1,12076,2410,11936,To do that you would need proper floodlights but ist feasible.
1,12077,2408,11863,We have a website which is good in parts, but could be improved with a bit of work by people with specialist skills
1,12078,2387,11924,If they can&#039;t commit to the majority of the season then they should not be captain&#039;s
1,12079,2418,11998,not entirely true or indeed fair - they are keen to develop a relationship beyond O&#039;Neill&#039;s
1,12080,2391,11790,Ability seems to have less effect on which team people play for than it used to. Each side seems to have its own squad and players more want their side to do well than for themselves personally to move up the club and play in a higher team. Plenty of people want to play only with ther mates. How does this sit with the &quot;spirit of the club&quot; as opposed to the spirit of the individual?
1,12081,2404,11978,lets have a formalised social calender that is fixed each year, so everyone knows that we always have a xmas do, a summer fun day, a new years eve party, music nights, burns night, etc etc
1,12082,2397,11783,contact the London Leisure College at Charlton Athletic - they have money and resources to develop local sports
1,12083,2393,12056,Using our resources. A few weeks back we had JG, Zin Zan Brooke and that Spring Bok all playing down here on the same day. More could have been done to spread the word to local clubs/press.
1,12084,2404,11990,they spend all day sunday here and it is difficult to get them here satuday as well
1,12085,2411,11783,I agree with first comment - poaching players from lower leagues clubs is common place and rarely frowned upon. there are more than able players competing in lower leagues who would jump at the opportunity to play in a higher league and not expect to be paid - these players i bet would commit to training
1,12086,2393,11996,Harsh!!
1,12087,2413,11788,what do we do to encourage more players for the lower sides and then improve them
1,12088,2394,12016,they need quality leadership
1,12089,2409,11948,Does the club have a mailing list for these school members  - so we can let them (or their parents) know what we can offer and ask them what we could provide them?
1,12090,2390,11941,the Old Colfeians spirit
1,12091,2397,11784,Parents of minis are a great resource to do all kinds of jobs - coaching, admin - within the organisation.
1,12092,2410,11791,Have we tried to make use of theschool development database to track down or stay in touch with players from the missing years?
1,12093,2417,11988,old colfeans was originally a grammer school and not a fee paying school
1,12094,2411,12070,does that mean we could get playing shirts that fit?
1,12095,2395,12052,agreed why not breakaway?
1,12096,2415,12010,You are very lucky to get 1 let alone anymore mini&#039;s per age group go all the way through the ranks to 1st team. It&#039;s about getting as many as possible to come back to the club when they finish university and that won&#039;t be many.
1,12097,2397,11829,How well do we communicate with them?
1,12098,2414,11903,not so. i think that getting 40 players to training would be great, however tell me what the quality of work can you do with these numbers on 2/3 of a pitch
1,12099,2407,11962,does no mean we have not asked???<br />What is wrong with sharing and expanding?
1,12100,2387,11789,To keep the spirit of the club as we know it and to be bale to build on what has already been achieved we must stay at Horn Park. Moving to another location will see us take a considerable step back in terms of development.
1,12101,2393,12064,Who?
1,12102,2396,11974,Touring is becoming splintered within the club - last season there were two seperate tours - clubs within clubs???
1,12103,2405,11789,Before we proceed with the new lease, the people responsible for the negotiations will have to be satisfied that we can survive financially under the present situation before they sign on the dotted line.   There appears to be a distinct lack of support from the younger element at present - the players seem to prefer drinking at O&#039;Neills to the Club.   We were unable to field a XV on Boxing Day and as a result the bar takings were decimated.   The present subscription levels are out of date - it costs &pound;60 per month to belong to a leisure centre and yet we object to paying &pound;50 per year to belong to the parent body.
1,12104,2387,11941,Rugby with the Fun left in
1,12105,2404,11849,yes, we are here to build on friendships we forged as kids at school or in the future in the minis
1,12106,2413,11788,how do we coach the lower sides and encourage them to play in a higher team
1,12107,2391,11795,If people here make such good friendships, then why is it that after 78 seasons we have only 65 non-playing members? Don&#039;t many former players come down, and if they do do they believe the place will continue to exist forever without them putting anything in any more?
1,12108,2411,12083,quite right
1,12109,2403,12048,With semi-pro clubs being promoted into the league it means that the league has become a lot harder.  So the standard of OC&#039;s playing probably hasn&#039;t diminished, its just that the oppo is tougher.
2,12110,0,0,How could we exploit the energy that will surround the world cup 2007?
1,12111,2416,11788,essential that players express themselves regardless what league they are playing in
1,12112,2410,11918,No reason why not but will be competing with school on this.
1,12113,2407,11947,that is a very poor negotiating position - we must stand firm and demand a decision much earlier than that - if we tentaively arrange an alternative we can announe that we will leave unless position is clarified - give them the problem - do not allo wthem to have all the cards.
1,12114,2394,11786,the food is awful. Players don&#039;t even get a meal after a game.
1,12115,2397,11893,Lot to be said for identifying players who don&#039;t go to university - lot of local clubs don&#039;t lose as many youngsters to university as we do. non-public schools are better for this
1,12116,2387,12061,Already have a social sec but that person has to work hard to really drive events forward. It takes a lot of time and energy.
1,12117,2414,12085,they won&#039;t come if they get offered &pound;40 a match a there tin pot club
1,12118,2408,12012,Having a single committee doing everything is not the most efficient way of running the club. There should be a playing sub-committee, and probably a finance sub-committee. The main committee should concentrate on the strategic issues.
1,12119,2404,12028,if we are running 5 sides I am pleased we are a succesfull club regardless of the 1st xv
1,12120,2397,12002,why?
1,12121,2393,12070,Totally agree. Standards are getting worse. Perhaps a standard shirt for all?
1,12122,2387,11968,Er...you still need ladies for speed dating unless of course you are gay?
1,12123,2415,12061,Not enough people to support the social aspect, its always the same 4 or 5 people, need more help.
1,12124,2392,11995,yes agree - more should be done to encourage the local community to come and support the club. To do that though we need to be able to offer them a decent facility and perceived value for money - competitvely priced drinks etc.
1,12125,2396,11783,The key area of recruitment is people playing for us at 16-18 (colts or 3rd/4ths) before they go to Uni, and then keeping contact
1,12126,2404,12075,here here
1,12127,2411,11787,i&#039;ll never forget her!!
1,12128,2405,11786,We need to make up our minds about the female element before we rebuild.
1,12129,2411,11974,nice idea - not sure how we&#039;d work it though
1,12130,2402,12110,we saw a massive surge in interest in the mini section following the last world cup. We need to encourage the juniors 12,13 &amp; 14 up for a more immediate result.
1,12131,2407,12115,why not organise an event for them the first year they leave school - a reunion perhaps?
1,12132,2415,11826,It needs to ruled out, it will never work and is not what this club is about!
1,12133,2408,11790,The junior teams are as much part of the club as the first team squad. We need to ensure that everyone, whatever their level, feels part of the club, and avoid any risk of &quot;clubs within the club&quot;
1,12134,2391,11941,Decency, respect for team mates and the opposition, doing it for enjoyment not a few quid, ideally the values include joining in with off the pitch activities to create stronger bonds between each other.
1,12135,2414,11939,the 1sts are the market area of the club. you need to get a fine balance between elite and mass participation/fun
1,12136,2387,12030,No you can&#039;t tap the same market as they are unlikely to go to 2 very similar eventsin sucha short  space of time. Also do you have any idea how much work is involved in organising a ball for 200  people. I&#039;ll tell you - LOTS - it is practically a full time job for 2-3 weeks.
1,12137,2397,12038,Agreed, but the district enables better contact with schools and the loca community. Finance is probably better handled by going into the private sector, where you are not competing with other clubs or sports
1,12138,2388,11974,You&#039;ll get a load of students that take a free week on the hammer that you will never see again.
1,12139,2394,11793,This is the essence of recruitment. We are a completely different type of club...we should exploit it...that is what will attract the players....sweatbands, themes, music night, tours...the great players will come if we provide a different club...
1,12140,2403,11973,are the vets a different club?  there must have been at least 30 players throughout the club that have played for the vets this season.
1,12141,2404,12114,this is a big area for potential improvment
1,12142,2391,11787,Integral part of the club&#039;s spirit and values - tours are for every member regardless of which team they play in, or even don&#039;t play at all
1,12143,2395,12080,sorry this is no longer the case we have addressed this very well over the course of the last 2 years and whilst its not exstingushed totally it is a lot better
1,12144,2394,11793,disappointed that there are only a few comments here
1,12145,2415,12110,We need to make sure that the club is open for all the games and that the large screen is set up.
1,12146,2393,12110,Host our own &#039;World Cup&#039;. Another local club ran one very succesfully.
1,12147,2417,12110,the web sight for both old colfeans and the mini&#039;s should be greatly improved more news as to when something is happening and not when it has happened.
1,12148,2387,12044,This is a great idea - university captains etc...Something for the committee to take up - could be worked in to the role of the social sec.
1,12149,2394,11797,I agree...Ian Martin is a great coach and fits the club
1,12150,2397,11921,A lot of clubs it has been the making of them, which is why we are slipping down the leagues.
1,12151,2408,11783,There are clubs around that do rely substantially on players coming through their mini and junior sides. The key seems to be to make the minis and the junior sections feel part of the club as a whole.
1,12152,2414,12120,to get more money!!!!
1,12153,2393,12116,Needs a group rather than individual so can spread the load and generate more ideas.
1,12154,2392,11905,in that case we need to keep potential players up to date with club affairs/progress - good or bad - out of sight out of mind
1,12155,2402,12136,I have a fair idea...we&#039;ll forget it then.
1,12156,2404,12129,Dennis and Smiffy always used to do this unofficially a few years ago, doesnt this happen now??
1,12157,2387,12083,True but did JG, Zin Zan and that SA fella really want to be pestered by loads of kids - also do the kids even know who they are?
1,12158,2411,12061,its the same 8/9 players who commit - no event can be organised off the back of this
1,12159,2415,11857,not many clubs have many than 3 pitches, they use other facilities that are avaiable to them, pherhaps we can use the leather sellars
1,12160,2396,11897,Commitment and hard work is key, there were several average players that made a sucess of playing at National 3
1,12161,2395,11941,playing for the enjoyment of mates not for any old farts but for ourselves
1,12162,2411,12151,agree - even if they only go as far as the 2nd team - if they&#039;re training and committing to it, it ads to the whole atmosphere
1,12163,2397,12036,which has absolutely nothing to do with it
1,12164,2394,12121,all of the club should wear the same shirts not like it is currently with different teams playing in different kit.
1,12165,2413,11785,Should we have a man of the match award for each side to generate more interest every week/month
1,12166,2388,12110,Laurence Dallagio will be at the end of his professional career after the next world cup. Lets contact Wasps and see if we can get him on a a free transfer.
1,12167,2404,12087,what makes you think we want to improve, I&#039;m quite happy with my ability and fitness, I dont care that I&#039;ll never play in the 1&#039;s again
1,12168,2414,12132,come on take the blinkers off
1,12169,2393,12157,I was talking about adults who would travel to see some rugby legends!
1,12170,2404,12106,javascript:selectComment(&#039;12437&#039;)
1,12171,2397,11921,Coaching is the area where payment can make the greatest contribution, including youth and adults, not just kids
1,12172,2387,12145,Problem here is most people at this club think things like this just happen. It is a case of 20% of the people doing 80% of the work. It also then needs to be publicised because there is no point having a screen up if no-one watches it.
1,12173,2411,12166,ha!
1,12174,2411,12117,yeah they will
1,12175,2404,11855,sorry I meant spirit
1,12176,2395,11787,Its got to be Thailand Next...
1,12177,2411,12168,ok now i see you and i still dont think its right
1,12178,2415,12151,I think that alot of effort is already made to make the mini section part of the club. However the mini section never respond in a positive way to any invitations, they have not yet attended any social events organised by the rugby club.
1,12179,2407,12122,er - you advertise
1,12180,2398,12149,perhaps he needs to be convinced that the club has the drive and ambition to play at the highest level possible.
1,12181,2394,11797,we have to get over the past...the main thing to remember is that successful sides have had great team spirit....Blackheath were frightened of it when they came here...you can&#039;t buy that... senior players have to get involved in developing the spirit.
1,12182,2396,11783,100!
1,12183,2391,11973,The origin of the Vets team is unique in the club. It&#039;s meant for players over 35, ones who by that age have possibly put over 15 playing seasons in to the club. Fact is the Vets had to enter a 5th team league to guarantee getting a team to play against most weeks. And when there isn&#039;t a Vets game Nick Evans encourages all the player sto be available for the other sides
1,12184,2403,12082,Blackheath are already in there. But an enquiry from OC&#039;s might produce something else.
1,12185,2413,11904,can we get more publicity in local newspapers etc which will encorage awareness and more members
1,12186,2404,12095,because we are a club for former colfes pupils and their friends and familiy, not a rugby club
1,12187,2387,12156,Yes it still happens, it happened for 2/3 people on the 2001 Australia tour and also for Italy, Scotland and I know it has been offered to certain individuals for Biarritz
1,12188,2411,12098,we could play bulldogs
1,12189,2400,12129,indeed this used to happen with 2/3 schoolboys being invited to tour initially subsidised by the club and then on the big tour subsidised by the tour itselfi
1,12190,2417,12166,yes please!! we will supply him with bed and board
1,12191,2394,11829,they are not asked.
1,12192,2408,11941,Being a traditional club, with a lot of teams, amateur status, players staying loyal even when the team not doing well, players socialising together, alacadoos and players mixing well, hospitality for visiting clubs.
1,12193,2387,11894,Over half the current first team are products of the school.
1,12194,2412,11783,the minis are to most people no more than<br />a cheap baby sitting service
1,12195,2395,12127,nice one mulders!!
1,12196,2404,12143,within reason this is good anyway
1,12197,2415,11797,Do we think that we can carry on with the coaching structure we currently have, or is it time for a change?
1,12198,2405,11971,This the gist of the future - do we want to remain a &quot;good old fashioned rugby Club&quot; or do we aspire to a higher status?   If the answer be the latter, then we shall have to pay our players and breed a team of mercenaries.
1,12199,2396,11787,Touring is becoming splintered within the club - last season there were two seperate tours - clubs within clubs???
1,12200,2402,12178,you are talking about people who by large have young family - they&#039;re not all young free and single
1,12201,2397,12194,Put the prices up and make more money!
1,12202,2416,11787,can we have along tour everyfew years to keep the excitement going
1,12203,2414,12007,incentives doesn&#039;t have to mean money
1,12204,2404,11955,by suffer do you mean drop out of london 1, I an suffer that to keep the club semi closed
1,12205,2415,12121,all sides need to wear the same shirt as their is only one colfian shirt.
1,12206,2391,11953,A very good summer event was held on a Saturday night at the Blackheath Music Halls. It was arranged by a professional event organiser on behalf of a charity who took a share of the profit. Unless we have a member who is a professional party organiser, let&#039;s do something like this again. The biggest thing we&#039;d all have to do is to get as many members (and their relatives and friends) to come along.

1,12244,2414,12109,we need to respond to this and adapt to our changing world
1,12245,2406,11981,they get paid to entertain
1,12246,2417,12012,cannot believe how few people in this room know how this club really works
1,12247,2414,11797,why can&#039;t we hook up with kent about being a nursery club for their better young players. we already have one in charlie clay so why not more of them. when they&#039;re ready they can move to &#039;better clubs&#039;
1,12248,2409,11783,Andy, I hope in due course the youth teams will provide a few players for some of the senior sides, but that is not the immediate problem. The issue is securing the continuity of the club more or less as it is and where it is now,  for the enjoyment of members. To do this we will need to find more money to pay the rent. Simply put we need more people, young and old coming, supporting, playing, drinking at this ground
1,12249,2396,12110,Ashes win made a huge difference for cricket
1,12250,2417,12208,i am going to ensure that decisions taken on tonights discussions are put into place for the future success of the club up to 2010
1,12251,2396,12232,Having arranged my own obsolescence in the cricket section by recruiting lots more people to all the jobs about three of us currently have to do, I hope to spend more time developing the minis section, covering all sports for the youngsters, so that the club has a conveyor belt of promising talent coming through for the future.
1,12252,2389,12243,continue to back the club and my husband
1,12253,2414,12237,Keep playing, making myself avialalble, encouraging (and cajouling) others, leading by example. Help and support other social events. Encourage my children and subsequent peers to join and particiapte in this club. Keep the spirit going through out the club. Involve my family more (hope they will be made to feel welcome)
1,12254,2397,12239,improve the links between club and school to ensure the better players come down to play. it is an important link that must be maintained.<br />To become more involved in the coaching set up in a vain attempt to improve the playing standards.
1,12255,2403,12231,Help to contribute to the financial stability of the club and continue to contribute to the lower sides by refereeing and sponsership of kit
1,12256,2408,12224,if im still alive i hope to be doing what i do now  and more also to help the clubs finance to drink more guinness
1,12257,2414,12237,I would like to help work with the club through this difficult passage, encouraging it to change  - times are different and we have to adapt - we can&#039;t always look back - we can look forward with pride as well.
1,12258,2400,12213,I hope to raise the profile of the club and encourage more people to get involved with what is a thoroughly enjoyable experience at OC&#039;s<br />I feel the onus is on the younger players to recruit more people to join us. And as a &quot;younger&quot; (ish) player I&#039;d like to think I can help towards that. I want to take a more active role in the coaching side as well as the social scene.<br />And I&#039;d like to be playing rugby for Ireland!!!!
1,12259,2398,12220,In the next couple of years I hope to resume playing for the club at the highest level that I can manage. I want my family to be involved in the club. I want to do my coaching badges for mini rugby so that I can support my nephew in his playing career.<br />I also want to get more involved in the social side of the club...get back involved with music nights and DJ&#039;ing.
1,12260,2395,12209,encourage younger members to perhaps take positions on the committee and give it a fresher  youthful look.
1,12261,2411,12242,Help ensure 1 of the key areas identified from tonights session is delivered by the start of next season
1,12262,2391,12241,Continue to be &quot;active&quot; member and consider taking on element of whatever has beed formalised as longer term plan. Fundamental to achieving beyond what we have now is further syndication and spreading of the load. Also seems that we have to recognise that our continuing longevity and prosperity is twinned with the Association and that although possible to breakaway its not a likely outcome. Given this a number of people will have to be willng to not only serve the needs of the Rugby Club but also recognise the maybe even greater need of the Association.
1,12263,2413,12210,I am going to continue my role as team secretary which currently means we are able to get more than one team out each week, as without this we will die. I will continue to play at my own standard though i&#039;d expect my first team appearances to be extremely limited.<br />During this time we will have held one superb summer/winter ball which will have raised vaulable finance for the rugby club<br />I will continue to ensure all new members are welcomed down the club and showed a good time with a few beers etc<br />I will encourage the older members as they retire to become alcadoos themselves and support the club in their old age<br />I will source a decent screen so we can watch the Rugby in style!!
1,12264,2412,12225,I&#039;m going to sort my neck out and get back to training on a regular basis. I will commit myself to the committee meetings. I will endevour to be diligent in my attendance at the committee&#039;s regular monthly meetings.<br />I will dedicate some of my time to positively contribute to the five year development plan when a tangible way of doing so emerges. I will be proactive, open minded and  in the role that I undertake.
1,12265,2406,12230,I will strive to gell the mini/youth sections together as one club so future generations of members grow up in one club rather than the fragmented often confrontational sections that exist at present, after all we are at a &#039;rugby&#039; meeting and the club offers cricket, football, squash, bowles, badminton, judo, karate, where are these guys tonight?<br />I will strive to improve the food offering and leisure feel of the club especially on Sundays where there is a massive opportunity for a morning to evening family day from toddler to pensioner, from bacon rolls to sunday lunch to evening snacks. This could and should  rival and overtake Saturdays as the main revenue earning day at the club.
1,12266,2390,12216,Continuing to support the club as much as possible. Encouraging others to do the same. Hopefully by 2007 and assuming things are going to plan attracting new membership and support will have become  more easily achievable.
1,12267,2392,12211,I will work with the junior section to ensure that we have successful under 15s and under16s who will, two years later, be providing players for the senior sides. I will influence the club to give the Juniors the support they require.<br />I will also ensure that the future of the club at Horn Park is secured, by working within the CSC to ensure that a new lease is agreed on terms that can be managed and that the financial viability of the CSC is assured. I will ensure3that the Rugby Club&#039;s financial stabilityis not undermined by weaknesses in other Sections of the CSC.
1,12268,2410,12212,I hope there will be something better to watch the Rugby World Cup games on than the existing tv set, like a plasma screen. I hope to have given CSC an opportunity to get one installed at a very keen price, perhaps by getting one donated by a manufacturer or sponsored by a local business.<br />Once a much better screen is here the bar team will have more opportunities to create a good and lively atmosphere to attract more people in all the sections to come here to watch various top sports events.<br />Mind you, that requires a bar team who want to do things like that and have the evergy and inclination to do it, rather than maybe see their job as simply no more than serving drinks to anyone who happens to just turn up in the bar. But the rugby club doesn&#039;t run the bar, CSC does, and it&#039;s in their hands to try and galvanise the place. All the rugby members can do is respond to overall CSC initiatives in this respect.
1,12269,2394,12221,Turn the manger role for the 1st team into a something that covers other sides. This will mean the job requirements to be spread across a small dedicated team that should lead to people appointed for the other sides below the 1st.<br />Hopefully this would give a boost to the 2nds &amp; 3rds particually and make the management of them easier for the captains and coaches. Plus of course improve the standard and enjoyment for the people playing.
1,12270,2418,12227,I will give as much personal time as I am able to supporting this club to achieve its goals.  While I don&#039;t yet know what they might turn out to be, what I do know is that everyone in this room cares about its future well being and I have had been made so welcome and had so much pleasure watching games that I want to put something back.  And I do need to get to more games (thanks for the reminder Dick) and when I do I will praise what worked well even when we don&#039;t win
1,12271,2387,12218,Other than playing, tonight has been the only time I have been involved with the &#039;running&#039; of the club. I would be prepared to give more time to help organise events. I believe the social aspect of this club is very important and more could and should be done as it would benefit all aspects.
1,12272,2400,12213,I&#039;d also like to get everyone who is here tonight to the music night so that they can thoroughly enjoy a good honest nigt of fun - REMEMBER MUSIC NIGHT 25TH MARCH 2006 - you won&#039;t regret it
1,12273,2402,12235,Help the mini section of the club, through my owns sons involvement, in promoting the club for June 2007.<br />This may be in helping in the organisation of a mini world cup where teams adopt different countries.  This may be difficult in June, when cricket takes over the pitches.
1,12274,2404,12236,continue to encourage new players, they may not be the best - they may not make the 1st team and win the club honours, but, it will keep the club alive. It will give my son somewhere to buy his old dad a pint!
1,12275,2393,12240,provide the best possible playing/training environment to enable players to achieve their goals
1,12276,2405,12215,Improve the relationship with the school. To achieve this I will make visits to the school to hold meetings with the 6th form as a whole to telll them what is on offer for them at the CSC. In particular to encourage the rugby players to start to train at the club and play for the club when they leave school or university.<br />To continue to support the mini section and try to intergrate them into the club more.<br />To continue to train and encourage others to train.
1,12277,2407,12238,We have to ensure that we are playing at a level that satisfies the total membership of the Club.   We have to improve our facilities and be prepared to finance realistically our goals.   We must never lose sight of our roots and should engender the spirit of rugby and the old Colfeians in those that follow us.<br />There is an intellectual argument that says that planning for the future is futile and that theory should be bourne in mind!
1,12278,2416,12223,I Will keep playing, training and making myself available for any side in the club. I will work hard to encourage other current players to do the same and also do as much as I can to bring new playing and non-playing members down to the club. I will help to raise as much money as possible through events and sponsorship to secure the financial future of the club. I will continue to assist with any events at the club or for the club whether it be focused towards the 1XV, the minis or any other aspect ofthe club<br />I would like to help improve the clubs links with the school, universities, other local schools and other local clubs particularly Blackheath should they remain successful.<br />More than anything I want to make sure it stays as a friendly, fun and successful rugby club by keeping the SPIRIT of the club alive and kicking
1,12279,2415,12229,i would like to help the club to keep it&#039;s friendly spirit and ethos which ultimately, I think, will lead to further rugby success and economic stability.
1,12280,2409,12234,My effort will be in gathering and keeping the U15s into a viable team that wants to play together for this club (win or lose) because they enjoy it and are proud of it. Hopefully we can help forge friendships between those players that we last their lifetimes.

1,12384,2886,12377,very good question
1,12385,2914,12374,Hello
1,12386,2875,12362,You should pay much attention this week on the methods utilized and have thourough knowledge for effective impartation
1,12387,2879,12368,Interesting!
1,12388,2904,12362,So you are interested only in teaching and not interested in learning anything. In my opinion one does not stop learning throughout one&#039;s life.
1,12389,2904,12366,I agree. Learning from other&#039;s mistakes is one of the best choices; we should not wait to commit them ourselves.
2,12390,2924,0,Are HR significant in your day to day work - an add on or buit into your approaches

2,12392,2924,0,How do you /will you make HR clear and relevant in training / planning / decision making
1,12393,2901,12306,It appears that if we are going to effectively combat terrorism we&#039;ll have to invest heavily in technology, whatdo you think
1,12394,2904,12307,Definition of terrorism and terrorist act in itself is a big tension. When can we say that &#039;one man&#039;s terrorist is no longer another man&#039;s freedom fighter.
1,12395,2904,12311,What comes first- humans or human rights?
1,12396,2904,12332,The biggest problem with Co-ordination is &#039;who gets the credit&#039;?
1,12397,2904,12319,It is better to &#039;prepare and prevent&#039; rather than &#039;repair and repent&#039;.
1,12398,2904,12309,Intelligence unlike French wine does not get better with age. It must be shared with all concerned without any delays.
1,12399,2904,12310,Legal direction should not be what the law says but what the law does.
1,12400,2917,12319,prevention is better than cure
2,12401,2924,0,What heed is paid nationally and internationally to preventative steps

1,12408,2897,12310,local legislation must take account of international conventions and protocols.
1,12409,2904,12308,If the right hand does not know what the left is doing, there can not be any success against terrorism.
1,12410,2903,12310,establish a special unit to deal with legistation,prosecution and detection of offences
1,12411,2879,12393,technology is great and it is certainly it&#039;s place, but let us remeber that the human element is most important
1,12412,2879,12398,well said
1,12413,2858,12308,Should all levels of management be involved in this training
1,12414,2862,12402,Some countries have different priorities
1,12415,2862,12402,Is there growing appreciation that terrorism and financing issues affect everyone
1,12416,2904,12403,The provision of &#039;preventive detention&#039; in cases involving national security is one such tool.
1,12417,2862,12402,Terrorists do not respect national boundaries, but they can use them
1,12418,2905,12403,(a) Domestic legislation that deals with anti-terrorist principles are in effect in our respective jurisdictions, except for Belize which is at present working on it.<br />(b) Antigua &amp; Barbuda seem quite proactive in their approach as even if one stays in that jurisdiction and finances terrorist activities elsewhere, the legistlation still holds them accountable.
1,12419,2921,12406,Inform the public asto the dangers of terroism.
1,12420,2888,12405,To identiy what the preventativesteps are, such as,  immigration and scrutinising traveldocumets . The monitoring of the ports as this a means of transhipment of persons and drugs.
1,12421,2921,12406,Make terroism an extraditable offence by legislation
1,12422,2862,12402,Some of this is just general crime prevention, calling it &#039;terrorism&#039; does not often change the basics
1,12423,2914,12416,this entry is credited to the wrong table
1,12424,2897,12404,the development of legislation as a preventative step to take away the financing from terrorist groups eg. money laundering legislation.
1,12425,2905,12403,(c) While the enactment of domestic legislation is commendable, it is just as important that the legislation should have &#039;teeth&#039;. It makes no sense to have the legislation without enforcement.
1,12426,2901,12406,Sometimes laws are put in place, treaties are signed etc, however, often times the people who are to make them work are not properly educated.<br />Lack of education often leads to people treating the problem in a casual manner.
1,12427,2921,12406,Make provisions for extraditing persons or prosecuting persons in local jurisdiction of persons who have committed terroism offences abroad
1,12428,2901,12406,The average person at certain levels within our society has other social issues dealing and so are less concerned about perventative steps
1,12429,2900,12406,Put more time in the thought process before these conventions are signed
1,12430,2929,12404,increase in security at airports and seaports
1,12431,2905,12403,(d) Embarking on the training of our law enforcement personnel (and other interested parties) in initiatives such as this one, is an example of a proactive step. We believe that our governments agreement to participate in this venture is an indicator of their commitment to terrorism prevention.
1,12432,2897,12404,the establishment of specialised units to tackle organised criminal activity such as drug and arms trafficking eg. Kingfish
1,12433,2895,12404,the modernization of the nation&#039;s major airports in attempt to among other things improve security
1,12434,2901,12406,Economic factors are sometimes at the art of the problem.
1,12435,2888,12405,Identifying and monitoring potential targets,especially those targets andactivities of international significance and or connectons.<br />Educating and sensitising both citizens and the law enforcement arm of governments, with respect to terrorist and what is deemed to be potential acts of terrorism.<br />Law enforcement officers to be trained and special units be put in place to monitor and receice information with repsect to.<br />terrorism<br />To put legal instruments / laws in placewith requisite / attendant sanction and penalties for the stipulated offences.
1,12436,2911,12404,The working together of customs police and defence force to combat drug traficing, crime, guns and ammunition from entering out ports.

1,12438,2913,12421,if your country implements UNSCR 1373and enacts domestic laws, terrorism will become an extraditable offence. But being  members of the UN, countries do not implement 1373, what can you do?

1,12440,2905,12403,The annual &#039;Trade Winds Exercise&#039; which occurs throughout the Caribbean region has as its focus this year anti-terrorism in light of the up-coming Cricket World Cup in 2007 which the region is slated to host.

1,12447,2913,12426,The highest level of decision making in countries sign treaties etc. they should know how to do and what to do. What is your suggestion for educating the decision makers in your country? How would you go back and improve the situation in your country?
1,12448,2905,12422,Seems to be an apt comment. Take the same general approach to all crime and do not get side-tracked by the tag. Pay attention to investigative procedures and prosecutorial skills, etc.
2,12449,2924,0,Who are the stakeholders with a legitimate interest in your decisions and actions?
1,12450,2905,12311,Happy to hear the presenter mention that a balance must be maintained when it comes to the human rights of the victim vs. the human rights of the offender. In Jamaica there seems to be the belief that only the accused/offender has rights that need to be protected. This is a most untenable position and so its refreshing to hear a different opinion being expressed.
1,12451,2895,12390,definitely, for the most part we are employed as public servants, the people we serve are entitled to certain rights and freedoms i.e. human rights.  importantly in an effort to foster and promote national security the rights and freedoms of individuals must not be disregarded.
1,12452,2895,12391,Short term: The creation of mistrust between the state and the general citizenry.

1,12456,2914,12450,if there is irrefutable proof that an individual has used torture in the commission of a terrorist act should there not be an exemption in the HR protection position and allow this individual to suffer the same fate after all he/she should have noproblem with this because they ascribe to this type of behaviour by making it a part of their terrorising modus operandi

1,12459,2901,12311,Is the Court saying that terrorists who take other peoples&#039; lives, should not as a matter of course take the offender&#039;s life? (HANGING)
1,12460,2876,12311,there is a fine line in relation  to the preservation of human rights and the use of force in situations involving the investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences
1,12461,2914,12459,there should be a clear line between suspected activity and proven activity and they should carry different hr positions so as to severaly punish a perpetrator equal to his/her behaviour if only to act as a deterrent
1,12462,2933,12449,the question should read - which stakeholders have an illegitimate interest in our decisions or actions
1,12463,2876,12310,need an up to date approach -i.e.to havelegislation in place to deal with the new situations arising from unlawful acts relatedto terrorism

1,12483,2897,12482,kindly elaborate
1,12484,2863,12481,Can the territory make provision in their legislation to the effect to render assistance by including the term &#039;under any treaty&#039;?
1,12485,2949,12481,that would certanly remove the safe haven potential
1,12486,2947,12480,can a country claim jurisdiction on a act of terrorism even though not committed in their country?.
1,12487,2862,12480,If the person is suspected of terrorist offences and we want no safe havens, why would you need to show jurisdiction if no other state objects to you trying the suspect
1,12488,2951,12484,yes but the term treaty implies bilateral; so a better way would be to say under any Convention or arrangement and those Conventions should, if possible be spelt out in a schedule. The word agreement is important as that would cover arrangements such as the Harare Scheme
1,12489,2862,12479,Is someone in transit considered to be in the territory for arrest purposes
1,12490,2862,12480,can we refuse to try our own national and refuse to extradite
1,12491,2949,12489,I dont see a reason why not even if actual prosecution comes as a result of extridition (opps) may be a convention problem though
1,12492,2876,12478,Are there any states that would notallow prosecution in anycircumstance under this concept -  i.e. prosecution only in the state wherethe offence was committed
1,12493,2862,12481,Can you list more simply when i need to do a formal request and when a formal request is not needed - does it depend on whether it will go into court
1,12494,2949,12490,At the expense of international alienation go right ahead  trust me this is not the climate to show telerance toward the criminal element
1,12495,2876,12481,have they proven pratically effective in cases where extradition is desired
1,12496,2912,12480,If a person is suspected of terrorist activity and is extradited to face criminal charges and is convicted, which country gets his access.
1,12497,2862,12480,you mentioned political exception (extradition) - what if the person has made an application for asylum before the extradition request?
1,12498,2876,12480,what happens when the crime happens on the high seas and the person is recognized as a &#039;stateless&#039; person
1,12499,2949,12493,make a formal request when you are seeking evidence to use in prosecution   an informal request should be saved for operational intelligence gathering and it helps to keep the formal request line unclogged
1,12500,2876,12479,offences committed on an airplane?
1,12501,2862,12481,we have death penalty in this region - sometimes others would not send a person back if there is death penalty possibility - what is the position
1,12502,2862,12479,what about at sea , not high seas
1,12503,2949,12501,that is probably the eight persons are on the HR fence
1,12504,2876,12478,could the civil law national successfully challenge being prosecuted in country of citizenship, if crimme not committed in that civil law jurisdiciton
1,12505,2862,12478,what if one of our nationals is taken from here by foreign agencies wihout us knowing, can we request him back for trial
1,12506,2895,12480,On the issue of jurisdiction, whats the justification for one country intervening in another countries internal affairs, for example why enter haiti, iraq and afghanistan but not rwanda
1,12507,2949,12498,we can do what amounts to a controlled delivery in that we monitor the indivual ans make the arrest when the ship gets into port
1,12508,2956,12482,Extradition has always been regarded as an act of State and it therefore engages both the judiciary and the executive. The final surrender is generally an executive act. The basic tenet of extradition is double criminality, this relates both to the conduct and jurisdiction. So, the Conventions provide the basis for extradition (where there is no general arrangement between the requesting/requested state) - in order to comply with such a request, extradition can only be granted for the mischief being addressed in that convention and not any other general offence of terrorism. Further, both states must recognise the same extra-territorial jurisdiction, if that is appliacable. Therefore, if that is not the case, no extradition can follow; which means the Convention has failed to achieve its intention. Where however a general arrangement/treaty is in existence between two states then the offence must be an extradition offence in order for the request to be processed - does this help?
1,12509,2862,12482,i don&#039;t understand this comment - elaborate
1,12510,2862,12509,ok
1,12511,2949,12506,hypocrital political foreign policy that suggests for the want of a better word racism(selective)
1,12512,2895,12481,why is it smaller states like those exisiting in this region faces high international scrutiny when it comes to the issue of the death penalty while the US not too far off from us executes quite a sizeable number yearly
1,12513,2912,12481,If a State is not a signatory to or has ratified  this UN Convention and has no laws treating on extradiction, would this State be in contravention of any international laws if they refuse to give any intelligence on an alleged &quot;terrorist&quot; and also in assisting in extradiction proceedings.
1,12514,2862,12511,how is this relevant to our own work in policing our borders - its high politics
1,12515,2937,12480,why the lack of reciprosity-ref england and germany---one country want but not willing to give
1,12516,2876,12481,What sort of sanctions would a state suffer if they do not sign/ratify/implement these conventions
1,12517,2895,12516,a withdrawal of international assistance in the forms of loans and grants
1,12518,2956,12495,regrettably no. If I may let me illustrate this by way of a case exampe: Algeria sought the extradition of a suspect accused of terrorism from the UK. As there is no treaty between Algeria &amp; UK, we had to rely on the Montreal Convention. On examination of the request it transpired that the accused was wanted for an act of terrorism which included the Montreal Convention offences - consequently the UK had to refuse to surrender. At the same time, the extradite/prosecute principle collapsed as we could not get the evidence from Algeria. So suspect is in UK with no prospect of extradition or prosecution - safe haven??
1,12519,2862,12513,The security council resolutions dealing with terrorism are made under Ch 7 of the UN Charter, which all states have agreed to be bound by. So there are some international duties to cooperate, but I also do not know whether we are obliged to cooperate informally on terrorist offences
1,12520,2862,12516,Its not really about sanctions for not ratifying - its about seeing your own national interest in this, or understanding international cooperation as in everyone&#039;s interest
1,12521,2862,12501,European Convention countries will not under their convention extradite someone to a country practicing the death penalty, without assurances that the DP will not be carried out even if imposed
1,12522,2956,12501,There is a prohibition on the return of fugitives or providing mutual legal assistance where the requesting state has the death penalty, unless the requesting state provides an assurance that the death penalty would not be invoked. This has not posed a great deal of difficulty as States are generally content to provide such an assurance. However a refusal to provide an assurance will lead to a refusal of assistance/surrender of fugitive!
1,12523,2958,12493,Informally obtained evidence can be used in court.the general principle asto whether informal or formal request is needed is whether a coercive power is to be exercised in the requested state; eg, search andseizure will require formal request; interview of suspect will require a formal request etc. But care needed re: informal request: ensure that execution of request is lawful under requested state&#039;s law.
1,12524,2862,12512,I think the US also gets attention for death penalty - it may not feel like if from here; sometimes the criticism is about mandatory sentence of death where the courts cannot hear evidence in mitigation
1,12525,2862,12490,It is a basic principle of this area of law that you either try the person yourself or render him to others who wish to try him; what relevance if he is a national or not?
1,12526,2958,12484,Re: MLA: yes; but it needs to be drafted wider than &#039;treaty&#039; so as to cover arrangements and schemes (such as The Harare Scheme) . In fact, a fairly straightforward piece of domestic legislation can address both outgoing requests and execution of incoming requests. UNODC is about to publish its model law on MLA (there has been Com Sec input).
1,12527,2956,12513,Extradition is an act of State and is therefore entitled under international law to refuse a request for extradition. This is reflected in all the extradition treaties/conventions under the general heading of &#039;grounds for refusal&#039;. The UN Conventions silently acknowledge the right of State to refuse to extradite and hence the &#039;poltical offence&#039; exception is specificlly set out.<br />In so far as mutual legal assistance is concerned, there are grounds for refusal but these are narrower than extradition requests.<br />In relation to the cooment on Chapter VII - the position is as follows: The SC has required States to sign/ratify and implement the CT Convention. UNSCR 1373, in particular spells this out; however that resolution went further and required states to criminalise the offences of terrorist financing (the offences are contained in the body of the resolution). In essence, therefore the SC has mandated States to criminalise CT offences and provide a framework for international co-operation; but it does not demand that States cannot refuse to assist. So looking at it from a narrow legal perspective there is no contravention of international law if States refuse to assist/extradite; but as the comment states there are international duties that states have taken on which places them under an obligation.
1,12528,2862,12486,It will depend on their own law; but if the person is physically present in your area, you can assert jurisdiction (if you decide not to extradite to the place where the act took place) - this will require obtaining evidence from the place where the act took place
1,12529,2958,12513,Re: MLA and informal requests:<br />An MLA request for evidence can be made even in the absence of a bilateral or multilateral. However, the requested may decline to assist. In doing so, it will be acting within its rights. An informal request for intelligence can also be made, but, again, may be refused.
1,12530,2956,12512,The US, like any other State that retains the death penalty must provide an assurance to the requested state - to this end they are in no different position to any other state. Let me illustrate this by an example - the US sought the extradition of individuals believed to be involved in the Embassy bombings in 1998. The extradition request has still not been complied with despite assurances regarding the death penalty as the defence submit that they can&#039;t be trusted! Proceedings are therefore still ongoing some 7 years after the request was first submitted!
1,12531,2958,12515,Lack of reciprocity in that example simply because of odd position that UK does not allow evidential use of UK intercept (intel only), but UK courts do allow adducing into evidence of intercepts from other states. Hence, can make the request, but problems complying with an incoming request.
1,12532,2863,12480,How would one deal with a continous offence, where it has been perpetuated in more than one jurisdiction, would all the States have jurisdiction to try that person for basically the same offence?
1,12533,2956,12486,The Conventions recognise 2 bases - territorial &amp; active personality test (nationality of offender but States can assert jurisdiction of the grounds of nationality of victim (passive) and national security. However, one must remember that a State cannot exert exorbitant jurisdtion which violates international law. The 1925 ICJ decision in the Lotus case confirms this principle. Jurisdiction as I mentioned earlier is inextricably linked to State practice and is subject to development; it is a living concept.
1,12534,2958,12504,Not on that ground alone. Similarly, where common law states have taken active personality jurisdiction, the national being prosecuted will not be successful in challenging only on the ground that the offence took place outside the jurisdiction, since that would defeat the basis of jurisdiction which has been taken. However, there may be other grounds of challenge: eg, both civil law and common law jurisdictions have &#039;double jeopardy&#039; protection.
1,12535,2956,12497,A33 of The Refugee Convention sets out the non-refoulment principle. Where a person has been granted political asylum it is unlikely that an extradition request would succeed. However practical approaches can be considered such as trying the person in another part of the requesting state; but this will depend on the basis of the grant of asylum
1,12536,2956,12496,I wonder if you would be so kind as to clarify what you mean by &#039;which country gets his access&#039;?
1,12537,2876,12531,this seems to amount to encouraging safe havens as the UK has taken a hypocritical stance
1,12538,2937,12479,derivative information----how would you go about teaching some one to observe/see/use this info or is it just an instinctive thing
1,12539,2956,12532,Evey state affected can claim jurisdiction, and this where international co-operation becomes most effective. Therefore, prosecutors &amp; law enforcement agencies of the affected States would negotiate the most appropriate venue for prosecution - this is what is loosely termed as &#039;jurisdiction shopping&#039;
1,12540,2956,12514,wholly agree with your observation. The issues of laws of war and international humantiarian law are quite distinct from what we are considering in this workshop.
1,12541,2862,12497,The asylum process must run its course - extradition proceedings will normally be on hold until this time
1,12542,2956,12490,Most CW states extradite their own nationals unless there is a constitutional bar to surrendering the national. So its not a ground for refusal unless national basic law so provides
1,12543,2862,12496,I think you mean that if your national is extradited to X and tried and convicted, do you receive him back for serving his sentence, or not - the answer must be that the requesting country will itself imprison the person, unless there is a prisoner exchange arrangement
1,12544,2956,12487,You must show jurisdiction as it is the basis of justiciability, in that national courts cannot try offences unless they are justiciable under national law.
1,12545,2862,12498,These are two separate issues - high seas, and stateless persons.
1,12546,2958,12537,Certainly at odds with position in most other states. Rationale is that by keeping non-evidential there will not be disclosure of methodology and extent or otherwise of tapping will not be revealed. Conversely, &#039;foreign&#039; intercept, from a State which allows evidential gathering, will not engage the same public interest and so can be used in evidence in the UK.<br />Likely that UK&#039;s position will change in the future to bring itsapproach more in line with that of other States.
1,12547,2862,12537,This is a bit strong a response - the fact that for other reasons UK law does not allow intercepts in evidence yet, hardly makes the UK a safe haven!
1,12548,2956,12489,Can you please clarify &#039;transit&#039;? If you mean the person has landed in the country and is on the landside of an airport, then they are deemed to be in the territory of the state and can be arrested.
1,12549,2862,12548,I mean &#039;airside&#039;
1,12550,2956,12500,Offences committed on an aircraft - here the State in which the aircraft is registered has deemed extended jurisdiction and can therefore properly try the matter
1,12551,2956,12502,where an offence is committed in territorial waters; the coastal state enjoys jurisdiction.
1,12552,2956,12549,Airside is a lot more complicated because you have a combination of being in the country but not entered the country - generally speaking the consensus is that airside is excluded as the person has not entered the country; so in a recent incident a person for whom a warrant was issued remained on the aircraft having learnt of the warrant, and this could not be executed as the aircraft was registered in another country (&amp; that country enjoyed deemed extended jurisdiction) - does this assist?
1,12553,2956,12492,Yes most states only recognise territorial jurisdiction; in fact all common law countries only operate on the basis of territorial jurisdiction unless the Statute provides active personality jurisdiction
1,12554,2956,12505,absolutely - because that is abduction/irregular extradition!
2,12555,2965,0,Your experience of the abuse of charities
2,12556,2965,0,Your perception of the use of charities
2,12557,2965,0,What control mechanisms do you think would work
2,12558,2965,0,Do you think that Hawala is a community service or a convienient tool for criminals/terrorists to move money
1,12559,2862,12555,I am glad you put a second question on use of charities - we should remember that most charities are very valuable to our societies - it is a pity if counter-terrorism leads to general suspicion of charities and NGOs. This needs to be handled carefully
1,12560,2862,12556,Charities are subject to audits like any other body; there is a danger of profiling some religious charities which are bona fide - this will only lead to resentment in that community
1,12561,2862,12558,Many people in caribbean rely on remittances from UK, US, Canada etc
1,12562,2863,12557,-the need to declare the source of the funds<br />-the need to ensure the identity of the sender, remitter and/contributer
1,12563,2937,12556,I think the use of charities is a common way to transfer money by terrorist---what suggesttions would you make for a small country to deal with this problem
1,12564,2863,12558,I think this system which is somewhat different from the remittance system allows a person to circumvent the system as it relates to the identification of the sender and recipient, thereby creating a fruitful environment for the financing of terrorism.
1,12565,2895,12556,the system of charity similarly to most systems have been perverted. many so called charities is responsible for the funding of many terrorist groups. this is not the fault of the system of charity of a result of the &#039;ingenuity&#039; of man
1,12566,2862,12557,i dont think outlawing alternative systems is the answer - if it is driven underground it will be invisible - it needs regulation but not overregulation surely
1,12567,2864,12558,Hawala builds contacts thereby feeding organised networking
1,12568,2862,12556,we must be careful not to try to paint all charities with the same brush - any good system can be abused, eg asylum system,
1,12569,2876,12558,howdoes the hawala agent finally get paid
1,12570,2862,12558,hawala is entrennched and is not going to disappear - we need to learn to manage it without driving it underground completely
1,12571,2958,12561,When you mention &#039;remittances&#039;, do you mean Hawala or a formal means, eg, Western union?
1,12572,2895,12558,the caribbean is home to many people of indian decent, some closer to the continent than others. is there any evidence of hawala here in the caribbean?
1,12573,2959,12558,Hawala is definitely a convienent way of laundering money.
1,12574,2960,12558,Hawala is a useful and seemingly legitimate tool in areas in which there are no formal banking mechanisms. However it also doubles as a great tool for international criminals to &quot;move&quot; money for a multiciplicity of illegal purposes.
1,12575,2901,12557,Do you have any sense if Hawaha is practicedin the Caribbean?
2,12576,2967,0,What is your experience the investigation of charity abuse
1,12577,2957,12559,A real point here, there are many worthy charities
1,12578,2862,12557,we can educate money transferrers to be aware of the possibility of being abused
1,12579,2862,12555,Is this as much an issue in this region compared to simply money laundering or moving cash in the drugs and crime context
1,12580,2863,12557,-Charities should be made to present a yearly report of their contributors.<br />-report what may be suspicious contributions.<br />-as far as possible charities should try as far as possible to ascertain the donor, especially where the sum donated is a sizeable amount.
1,12581,2863,12576,has anyone here done such investigation?
1,12582,2875,12576,It is very difficult to evidence the illegitimacy of the charity. These organizations receive alot of government backing and is given many privileges and are as result are not placed on the high risk point by most agencies and hence increase the degree of difficulties.
1,12583,2875,12576,It is funny how illegitimate activities are not recorded however the day in questioning there are legitimate recorded transactions which can and have thrown out cases.
1,12584,2949,12582,Given the alert status necessary in combatting terrorism it may be necessary to take the gloves off per se by implementing stronger checks and balances
1,12585,2957,12572,yes, definitely there is Hawala in the Caribbean. But most of its use here is for sending money to genuine family members. However, some of it is also used for corrupt politicians and other criminals.
1,12586,2957,12559,I entirely agree with you. We should encourage the legitimate use but discourage/prevent their misuse.
1,12587,2957,12579,Money laundering and movement of drug money are the main issues here. But some charities do use tax havens to stash away their funds.
1,12588,2957,12568,I agree. We need to prevent the misuse.

2,12710,3016,0,What measures do you have in place to enable early intervention?
1,12723,2991,12715,Yes. Measures that intefere with privacy must be lawful, covered by legal authority, particularly if the objective is evidence [not just intelligence] (body searches, bugging, phone tapping, correspondence, use of undercover agents).<br />As far back as 1978, the European Ct of Human Rights in Klass v Germany accepted that in order to deal with the threat from highly sophisticated terrorist activity, &quot;the Court has to accept [as compatible with the right to privacy] the existence of ... some powers of secret surveillance .. as necessary in exceptional circumstances in a democracy for the prevention and detection of disorder&quot;,<br />However, the Court noted that because these forms of surveillance and interception are &quot;a serious inteference with private life&quot;, it is essential to have and to follow clear and precise rules, to have judicial supervision initially and periodically, and not to give investigating authorities &#039;carte blanche&#039; - the fear (at the extreme end) is that we find we live in a &#039;big brother&#039; society where none of our personal life is truly private.

1,12728,2991,12709,This is what I mentioned in relation to human rights-based approaches to policing and community relations - John&#039;s presentation clearly highlights the significance of the community as a source of intelligence and cooperation.<br />Policing practices (arbitrary arrests, searches, abuse of powers, excessive use of force, no plan of outreach, violations of basic rights) can destroy community relations leading to cycles of distrust. This is what I meant by police not waiting for community to change its view of police - the police need to make a bridge. &quot;Human rights-based policing is right in principle / law - and it works, it makes the police officer&#039;s job easier in the community, it helps in the investigation of criminal activity.<br />All terrorists must eventually live in the community. If relations are poor with the community, and no culture of talking cooperation and reporting, detection will not take place.

1,12741,3013,12738,no right should be absolute!
1,12742,2991,12733,Yes, see the comments on the first point - about community intelligence
1,12743,2991,12741,Rights are not absolute. Look at the ICCPR in your folder, for example, or at Article 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the ICCPR, each right is qualified by limitations - for example &quot;everyone has freedom of expression&quot; (Art 19(1)) but this is limited see Article 19(2) - the right &quot;may be subject to certain restrictions ... as provided for by law and as necessary...for respect of the rights and reputations of others...for the protection of national security, public order, public health, or morals&quot;. So, the right to freedom of expression (like other rights) is not unlimited - this is a misconception. The right to freely express oneself by making videos is limited by public morals requirements for example forbidding child pornography.<br />It is very important to break down myths about rights with law enforcement officials, so as to get them to see these as simply part of the framework or environment in which they live and work. Rights do not threaten their job.
1,12744,2980,12710,periodic meetings/briefings amongst enforcement agencies-
1,12745,2991,12722,See comments below on &#039;balancing&#039; - the freedom of expression is limited by balancing it with protection of the public from incitement to hatred and violence

1,12749,2991,12730,Yes - this is also related to community relations more generally. The manner in which random searches are done can put the public off, if they are not sensitively done. In the same way, great care needs to be taken with searches of homes - the starting point is always that person&#039;s privacy is to be respected UNLESS there is a lawful reason for search of person or property.
1,12750,2991,12734,It is true that the wider issues of religious tolerance and diversity (which raise issues of human rights, non-discrimination, equality), these issues feed into the wider terrorism debate. Of course, religion can be hijacked and abused. But lack of respect for people&#039;s religious rights can inflame situations, leading to recruitment etf
1,12751,2991,12735,See the ICCPR and American Conventions in the folder - non-discrimination and equal treatment before the law are central to a rights-based response. Systematic patterns of discrimination against groups of persons, as well as being wrong, is likely to make policing and intelligence gathering much more difficulty.
1,12752,2991,12737,See ICCPR and American Convention provisions dealing with freedom of association and freedom of assembly. This relates to the &quot;balance&quot; between liberty and security  - how much do we affect people&#039;s ordinary lives while trying to protect them? Over the long term, how does a blunt response to threats lead to a very different looking society to the one we want? Now, some of these are big, philosophical issues - but the challenge is to get officers to see their own conduct as part of a bigger picture, and to consider the consequences of their conduct in the longer term

1,12757,3031,12754,Terrorism is an extremist operation: hence Jamaicans have not really been seen by Jamaicans as being a probable target. However, due to being a &#039;soft target&#039; we should be more concerned about Terrorism.
1,12758,3031,12754,We have focused on Money Laundering, Trans-National criminal organisations and other criminal activities as they are seen as more immediate threats to our Sovereignty.
1,12759,3029,12755,Terrorism Risks<br />(1) The geography of the islands in the Caribbean region make them quite vulnerable to terrorist attacks.<br />(2) Recruitment of Caribbean nationals (example Jamaicans) into terrorist activities puts the region at risk to possible attacks.
1,12760,3031,12754,Jamaica is more tolerant of divergent religious beliefs/practices, however terror organisations are also well organised criminal organisations hence we can become locations where laundering takes place, or income can be earned from elicit activities
1,12761,3031,12754,Risks take several forms:<br />- Reputation as nationals of a nation perceived in a negative manner
1,12762,3031,12754,ICC CWC 2007 is recgnised as a potential target for terrorist activity
1,12763,3031,12754,Tourist industry is another potential soft target

1,12765,3031,12754,We are especially vulnerable because of our proximity as staging grounds for terrorist activities to North America eg. the Bahamas, Cayman
1,12766,3032,12755,(3) Economic factors<br />(4) Deportees who are returning to the region expose us and make us more vulnerable.
1,12767,3031,12754,There is the perception and credible belief that there is a low level of risk for the region, however it should not become an excuse for ignoring the threat
1,12768,3032,12755,Organized Crime<br />(1) Drugs and arms/ammo. runnings<br />(2) Kidnapping<br />(3) Extortion by organized gangs<br />(4) Murder<br />(5) Reprisals (eg. arson, etc.)

1,12822,3103,12783,-1st Search outside territorial waters, 2nd search inside territorial waters<br />- Was there a right to search the first time?<br />-Issue of drug transaction conducted on high seas, issue of illegality<br />-Customs has search &amp; arrest powers based on reasonable suspicion - Criteria satisfied : Trawler assumed to be speeding out of territorial waters into international waters, then forced to return to territorial waters where 2nd search conducted<br />-nature of the detention/questioning done on the trawler - Was due process followed?<br />-No Caution given<br />-Use of promise, threat, coercion may affect admissibility of statement
1,12823,3104,12779,The initial search ocurred on the high seas, and if there is in place a bi-lateral or mutilateal agreement in place then the stop and search of the vessel would be approprite, but genereally if this is not the case the stop would be valid but not the search.
1,12824,3097,12785,If the vessel is boarded in the High Seas the B would have jurisdiction in any event. However if A has a national on board the vessel, then if A has extra-territorial active personality  jurisdiction, then they too have jurisdiction.
1,12825,3104,12779,any contraband found during the initial search would be subject to challenge if used fro evidential purposes

1,12827,3103,12786,-Authorisation from Home Minister is legitimate only if he has such authority<br />- Informal relationship does not affect passing of intelligence but tipoff would not be admissible<br />- Usually in C&#039;bean territories a Magistrate/Judge has such authority on an application made to him<br />-HR Issue Violation of right to Privacy which is guarded by constraints applied<br />-Intercepts products are admissible if proper authority was obtained, ie if Minister is competent authority
1,12828,3103,12789,- It can be admissible if the request was made formally, based on evidence the request was made informally<br />-Prosecutor in A will have difficulty only if he intends to use it - he may not need it
1,12829,3101,12784,1. Yes it gives a cause of concern because of the foreign currencies and cocaine found in the vessel and if it would be within the jurisdiction of A to search<br />2. yes, the intercept products are admissible, provided the Home Minister authorising the interception is the competent authority governing laws relating to interception of communication  but it has human rights implication as it relates to invasion of privacy
1,12830,3097,12785,There is no indication that the trawler is flying the flag of another State, and so a presumption can be made that the vessel is registered in A - this would permit the initial boarding &amp; searching.
1,12831,3104,12779,Subject to the existence of a multi lateral or bi-lateral agreement or treaty such as the &#039;Shiprider agreement&#039;, the second search of the vessel in territorial waters would have to conform to the standards set for stop and search of vessels.<br />Any contraband found in these circumstances would be subject to the provisions of these agreements.

However, the granting of the authorisation for an indefinite period would be in violation of Sam&#039;s human rights<br />Also he intercept for such a large group is too wide, because it violates the individual&#039;s right to privacy

Mr OLUWESU has witnessed four men get out of the vehicle and proceed to decant yellow liquid from a large container in the boot into separate, smaller bottles which each man has then placed at least one of into his rucksack.  The vehicle was driven by an IC1 female who appeared to give each man a slip of paper before driving off towards REGENTS PARK immediately.<br />Mr OLUWESU was very concerned about this behaviour and took camera-phone images of the suspects in the street.  The four then split into two groups of two and he followed one pair through a nearby park to the REGENTS PARK LT station where they were seen to enter using Oyster cards.  One of the two (referred to below as Subject 1) was seen using a mobile phone as he was followed by the informant.<br />Mr OLUWESUs fellow security guard on duty, Mr Ian BRADSHAW, followed the other two men to GREAT PORTLAND STREET LT station where they also entered and were lost from sight.<br />This incident was declared an OPERATION ANDROMEDA by IR and lasted approximately 30  minutes  before the two groups were lost into the tube network without further trace at about 0900hrs.<br />The five subjects were described by the witnesses as follows:<br />Driver - Female, IC1, late 20s, dark hair wearing a Muslim headscarf.<br />Subject 1 - Male of Somalian appearance, a/age 30 yrs wearing a<br />black parker coat and black trainers.<br />Subject 2(*) - Male of East European appearance, a/age 30 yrs wearing a dark blue hooded sweatshirt and dark jacket, black trousers and dirty white trainers<br />(* This male was seen to travel in the front passenger seat and spoke to the female before parting.)<br />Subject 3 - Male of Somalian appearance a/age 25 - 35 yrs<br />Subject 4 - Male of East European appearance a/age 25 - 35 yrs<br />Subjects 1 and 2 were followed by Mr OLUWESU into REGENTS PARK LT and Subjects 3 and 4 were followed by Mr BRADSHAW into GREAT PORTLAND ST LT (no clothing descriptions at this stage of the latter pair).  Both guards witnessed the fluid being poured out by the subjects and the group were described as purposeful and aware of their surroundings throughout.  Mr BRADSHAW believes that the men he followed were suicide bombers.<br />There are no immediate indications as to the whereabouts of the five subjects at this stage.

Liaison with the data-holders for the Oyster card system has identified a corresponding sequence on their database which has initially identified the following two Oyster card numbers as belonging to Subjects 1 and 2.  The full data sequence from the barrier is being passed to the officers who have access to the CCTV images so that they can compare a wider time period and confirm that we are looking at the right Oyster card users (in case of disparity in the timings).<br />Further details to follow asap re the Oyster cards identified.

The other has been used for the last 9 days consistently and seems to show movements on buses and tubes throughout the West End area throughout each day.  This data is still being mapped and analysed by the Intel Unit but the initial finding is as follows:<br />On each weekday since activation the user has commenced his journey on the number 53 bus towards Elephant and Castle from a bus stop in OLD KENT ROAD.  He has then entered the tube system at Elephant and Castle LT.  On what appears to be his last journey of the day on several occasions during the period he appears to be making a return journey along this route exiting the tube at the Elephant and Castle and boarding a 53 bus eastbound.<br />The inference is that the user resides near the bus stop that he uses in the mornings;  ie. the area of OLD KENT ROAD<br />Analysis of this data continues.

1,12875,3123,12874,In response to the finding of Message 11 a possible ident has been suggested for Subject 1:<br />Abdi MOHAMMED, dob 13/07/81, IC3 Somalian national, PNCID 36455/99H, CRO 57734/99V, F510, thin build.  He is reported on MCRAC as recently residing within 500metres of the bus stop highlighted (Address: 13B ALLINGTON STREET, SE ).  He features on SO13 CRIMINT and on HOLMES as a peripheral figure in Operation QUIVER in early 2005.  This op resulted in convictions for three Pakistani nationals under S57 TACT, although MOHAMMED was never arrested or charged and it appears that he was an associate of the accused.<br />Initial comparison of his custody image following a 2004 charge for disqual driving with those available of Subject 1 does not preclude a match (although it cannot assist further due to the poor quality of the latter images).  Telephone numbers for Abdi MOHAMMED are being developed as part of a subject profile and, when sourced, cellsite data will be ordered on these to compare his movements with those seen today by Subject 1 and also against the Oyster card movements seen this last week.

The QUIVER cell were convicted of possessing articles for terrorism namely computerised files which included, amongst other things,  downloaded video footage of suicide attacks on coalition forces overseas and a videoed instruction manual on how to construct an explosive body-belt for PBIED attacks.<br />The QUIVER cell were sentenced to 7 years each and have been in custody since May 2005.  MOHAMMED.s mobile at that time was:<br />T07903233114 - T-Mobile prepay - no details<br />SPOC checks show that this mobile is still active and the number has not been re-allocated in the intervening period.

1,12883,3123,12882,1215 Message 20 - SIO<br />In light of the findings re Mr AHMED and his ownership of this vehicle, I have requested that local Special Branch units conduct covert enquiries to establish if he is at his place of work today and from there I will consider in liaison with the HSB what measures can be taken to further assess his potential involvement in this morning.s incident.

1,12885,3123,12884,1227 Message 21 - Intelligence Unit<br />Data has now arrived for the T*114 mobile blvd attributed to Abdi MOHAMMED.  Initial analysis indicates that the phone is still active and is currently in the corresponding cellsite area of his H/A 13B ALLINGTON STREET (ie near the relevant bus stop).   The first activation of the day though was only at 1032 hrs and hence there is nothing to assist in confirming a link with this mornings incident at this stage.  A certain finding is that if he is ident with Subject 1 then he was using a different mobile when seen by Mr OLUWESU than the one we have for him .  The initial cellsite analysis also shows that the phones location over the last week does not appear to reflect the movements identified for Subject 1s Oyster card.

1,12887,3123,12886,1230 Message 22 - SIO<br />I have tasked the operational team to identify an OP on the home address of MOHAMMED in order to establish movements at this location. Surveillance team tasked to stand-by to support in readiness for subject sightings.

1,12895,3123,12894,1322 Message 26 - Intelligence Unit<br />Further analysis of T*114 data (blvd MOHAMMED) indicates consistent usage over the last three weeks with cell data indicating that the user is residing in the area of the (postcode) mast (the apparent home cell location for MOHAMMED.s H/A).   There are several high frequency contact numbers which are being developed by the intel. unit to assess their possible relevance.<br />The movements of this phone however do not correlate with the movements identified from the Oyster card blvd used by Subject 1.

Local units have also identified a silver Vauxhall Zafira VRM BV04DCG parked up and unattended in the street at the rear of the premises.  This location is covered by Local Authority CCTV cameras and the SB team are en route to view this asap to attempt to establish how long the vehicle has been parked there.  Given the time scales involved; the early indications are that this vehicle may not be ident. with the vehicle sighted this morning.<br />SIO briefed.

1,12903,3123,12900,1359 Message 29 - C3000 staff<br />Update from officers viewing BAKERLOO LINE CCTV re Subjects 1 and 2.<br />Furtehr to Message 12 - the subjects were seen boarding the second carriage from the front of the BAKERLOO southbound train at 0859 hrs at REGENTS PARK LT.  Initial enquiries have not identified the subjects as disembarking the train from the corresponding carriage at any stop between there and ELEPHANT AND CASTLE LT.  The subjects have clearly changed carriages, and/or separated or changed outer garments during the journey and more time will be needed to examine the CCTV footage.  The Oyster card which has provided the data in relation to Subject 1 has not, we are told, indicated as yet that the subject has left the tube network since earlier.
1,12904,3123,12901,1428 Message 30 - C3000 staff<br />Update from HUDDERSFIELD officers;<br />Local CCTV has the vehicle VRM BV04DCG arriving at its current location at 0930 hrs today and being driven by a male apparently ident with the male seen in the shop.<br />A PNC information marker has now been put on VRM BV04DCG with an appropriate form of words to contact C3000 if sighted but not to attempt to stop.

1,13020,3147,12981,1452 Message 32 - Intelligence Unit<br />T*114 remains fixed at 1445 hrs at the OLD KENT ROAD mast.  At this time it was called by T07990472903.  This number has featured on recent billing and research/acquisition of subs is ongoing.
1,13021,3147,12982,1510 Message 33 - Intelligence Unit<br />T*903 at message 32 is shown as a prepay - no details.  It is a high frequency dialled number by T*114 but is no trace on any of our databases.
1,13022,3147,12983,1525 Message 34 - Intelligence Unit<br />A full profile has now been compiled on Youssuf SALAMEH.<br />The address of 6 SHERBORNE STREET, W103JS, has been linked to him as stated above as a %u201Ccurrent address%u201D provided to DSS with whom he is signing on fortnightly.  This link has also been corroborated by a CRIS hit from December 2004 when he reported a racial incident to police (he later withdrew the allegation).  At that time he gave the landline as T02073647820.  From financial and other enquiries this hardline has been corroborated and the following telephone number has been attributed to him also:<br />T07931533790  - T-Mobile - Prepay - no details.   This number was activated 18/07/2005 and full call data plus cellsite has been obtained.<br />Initial fast-time analysis of this data has revealed the following:<br />-	There was frequent and consistent usage of the phone up until one week ago.<br />-	There is no call data at all for the last week indicating that the line is apparently inactive.<br />-	Customer notes show no additional details.<br />-	Cellsite analysis indicates overnight residence throughout the call data period as being almost exclusively at the W103LM cell mast (this would appear to be the home cellsite for 6 SHERBORNE STREET<br />SPOC team have been tasked to conduct checks on the IMEI number for the user%u2019s handset and to identify any other handsets previously used with this SIM card
1,13023,3147,12986,1532 Message 35 - SIO<br />In light of the above, I have tasked the operational team to identify and establish an OP on 6 SHERBORNE STREET.
1,13024,3147,12987,1535 Message 36 - C3000 staff<br />From Ops team - research please on potential Ops opposite 6 SHERBORNE STREET
1,13025,3147,12988,1547 Message 37 - Intelligence Unit<br />Re OP on 6 SHERBORNE STREET: Numbers 5,9 and 13 all have negative indicators.  7 and 11 are both possible with the latter being favourable according to details held (Ops team briefed by phone en route)
1,13026,3147,12989,1550 Message 38 - Intelligence Unit<br />The T*790 number attributed to SALAMEH has previously been used, albeit once only and very briefly, with a different handset.  The usual handset is currently not believed active on the network.  The other handset has been shown on T-mobile%u2019s network today with the following SIM: T07961810524 - again subscriber is shown as pre-pay no details and data has been ordered on this number
1,13027,3147,12990,1601 Message 39 - C3000 staff<br />OP reports still no sign of any occupants at 13B ALLINGTON STREET
1,13028,3147,12991,1621 Message 40 - Intelligence Unit<br />Previous data for the T*790 number attributed to SALAMEH has a number of high frequency callers dialling in and out.  The first subscribers on these are returning and being researched by the Intel%u2019 cell.  Of interest is the following:<br />T07801486007 - Vodafone contract phone r/k; Mr I. JOVETICA of Flat 9, 17 FROBISHER STREET, SE15ET.  A landline was given for this address T02075064198 (subs underway)<br />Initial research on this male with the Immigration Service indicates that he is ident with:<br />Irfan JOVETIK, aged 29 yrs (dob 02/02/1977), NT PNC, IC1, a Bosnian Muslim who successfully sought asylum in 1997 having allegedly fled persecution in his home country.  A file photograph is being requested to assess the potential that this man may be ident with one of the two East European looking males witnessed this morning.<br />Of note; the address given - which from initial research appears to still be current - is located along the 53 bus route.  Address profile under-way.
1,13029,3147,12992,1632 Message 41 - C3000 staff<br />From Ops team:<br />***OP now established with clear coverage of front door of 13B 6 SHERBORNE STREET, W10***
1,13030,3147,12993,1641 Message 42 - Intelligence Unit<br />Data now obtained on T07961810524 (possible alternative/linked number for SALAMEH - in use with other handset)<br />This number has activated on the network one week ago and has used the handset identified through SALAMEH%u2019s other number constantly since activation.  Of particular interest is the following:<br />-	The activation date correlates exactly with the cessation of activity on T*790<br />-	The number appears to call a specific grouping of 4 other mobile numbers only and no hardlines<br />-	There are no common numbers with the data obtained for T*790<br />-	The usage is both intermittent and limited - unlike T*790 - and text messaging appears to be favoured over voice-calls<br />-	From the limited data available (ie this last week only), the phone has registered last thing at night on three occasions on the home cell-mast for 6 SHERBORNE STREET<br />The T*790 number is on live-trace but remains inactive at this stage.<br />T*114 has continued activity and appears to be following its normal call pattern.
1,13031,3147,12994,1650 Message 43 - Intelligence Unit<br />Further enquiries on JOVETIK and the T*007 mobile subscribed to him reveal the following:<br />The flat he occupies at FROBISHER ST is part of a Local Authority assisted housing scheme which is predominately occupied by foreign nationals who either are or have sought asylum in the UK.  The premises has a resident landlord who has assisted police before (enqs thru%u2019 local Boro CTIO) and the hardline provided by JOVETIK when registering his phone is the communal line at the property.  An image has now been obtained from the UKIS of JOVETIK and  although this is several years old - there are similarities with the images obtained  of Subject 4.<br />Of particular note is that his T*007 phone number last registered on the vodafone network 6 days ago and has not registered since.  There were no handset changes and the IMEI has not been identified on any network since this time.  Clearly this apparent cessation of usage correlates with that seen on SALAMEH%u2019s T*790 phone.
1,13032,3147,12995,1710 Message 44 - C3000 staff<br />OP update:<br />IC1 female in Muslim headscarf (face visible only) sighted in front window of 6 SHERBORNE STREET.  Photograph obtained by OP.
1,13033,3147,12996,1715 Message 45 - Intelligence Unit<br />There is no record of a female residing at the premises with SALAMEH on any of our indices or with the local Authority etc.<br />Further call data updates indicate the following:<br />-	T07961810524 was cellsited at the W10 mast at 0717hrs today when it sent a text message to T07957772989.   T*524 was then cellsited again at 0848 hrs in the W1 area just south of REGENTS PARK.<br />-	T07957772989 is one of four other numbers with which T*524 has exclusively contacted since activation one week ago (T07961810523, T07961684390 and T07901637887 being the others).  All these numbers have activated  on or about the same day one week ago<br />-	One of the other numbers is T07961810523 - one digit different to the above - which would indicate that these two mobiles were purchased together (considered along with the call data)<br />All phones detailed now on live trace.
1,13034,3147,12997,1725 Message 46 - C3000 staff<br />Update from SO13 Ops team:<br />Feedback from contact made with landlord at FROBISHER STREET indicates that JOVETIK is known to the landlord as a very private individual  within the block who has been a relatively long term resident.  He also believes that there is a computer in the flat; although this is third party info and he himself has not been in Flat 9 for some time now.<br />He further states that JOVETIK was last seen yesterday leaving the block and that he is confident that he has not returned and that the flat is empty.  There is a signing in policy which is generally adhered to and JOVETIK is not shown as having returned.
1,13035,3147,12998,1730 Message 47 - SIO<br />I have tasked the IO to assess the feasibility of effecting a covert entry and limited search at this location.
1,13036,3147,12999,1748 Message 48 - Intelligence Unit<br />T07957772989 was last cellsited at 0849 hrs at the same W1 cell mast as the T*524 (when it received the text message from the latter).<br />Neither phone has activated since that time.  T07961684390 and T07901637887 have not activated at all today but were cellsited sporadically in the SE1 area (albeit amongst other locations also during the course of the day)  Data on all these numbers is very limited due to the low usage by the users.<br />T07961810523 has activated this morning though (when switched on it has registered on the network to receive a voicemail) and at that time (0746 hrs) it was at the W10 cell mast.   This phone has then sent a text message to the T*524 number at 0947hrs which would imply that this other number has in fact been switched off since that time as this message has not been registered as having been received by the handset for the latter.<br />No update on T*114 (Abdi MOHAMMED) at this stage
1,13037,3147,13000,1807 Message 49 - Intelligence Unit<br />Activation on T*989 at 1802 hrs;  call made to T*523.<br />T*989 was cellsited at a W11 mast approx 1 mile away from the SHERBORNE ST address<br />T*523 was cellsited as before at the W10 mast.
1,13038,3147,13001,1819 Message 50  - C3000 staff<br />From OP at SHERBORNE ST:<br />***Two males have walked up the street from the South end and entered number 6***<br />Described as ident in clothing and general description as subjects 1 and 2 from this morning with only the IC3 (Subject 1 carrying a rucksack).

Mapped by Intel%u2019 for SIO.  One activation appears to be the incoming text message from T*523 earlier today (indicating that the user has just switched the phone on).  The second activation though was a text message back to the T*772 number at 1938 hrs.
1,13045,3147,13008,1948 Message 56 - Intelligence Unit<br />T07810556772 is an Orange prepay phone (no keeper details) activated on 07/03/06.<br />Data has been ordered although this will be delayed due to a problem with the SP systems at present.  Initial analysis though indicates prior contact with T*007 (JOVETIK) and T*790 (SALAMEH) from their respective data periods.<br />T*772 now on live trace
1,13046,3147,13009,2001 Message 57 - Intelligence Unit<br />Status checks run on all mobiles featured in Log 51 - no change.<br />The landline T02073647820 at 6 SHERBORNE STREET is now active as of 1950 hrs though and appears to be connected to the Internet

1,13048,3147,13011,2032 Message 59 - Intelligence Unit<br />None of the phones have activated since last update.<br />No trace of any email accounts linked to the identified persons or premises thus far
1,13049,3147,13012,2105 Message 60 - SIO<br />Having been briefed on the feasibility I have now authorised a covert search at the empty flat at the FROBISHER STREET premises to be progressed as soon as practicable.
1,13050,3147,13013,2147 Message 61 - Intelligence Unit<br />Data acquired now on T*772 (unattributed text messager) and merged with the existing call data.  Analysis ongoing and relevant details will be briefed back.<br />The five linked mobile phones identified thus far as having activated and contacted each other in the last week have not updated since the last update<br />The landline at 6 SHERBORNE ST was connected to the Internet for about twenty minutes at 1950hrs but is now inactive again.
1,13051,3147,13014,2203 Message 62 - C3000 staff<br />Search underway at Flat 9, 17 FROBISHER STREET, SE15ET.<br />Initial feedback indicates that there is a PC in the room and some personal belongings but the studio room is relatively sparse.  SIO to be briefed by team on completion.
1,13052,3147,13015,2233 Message 63 - Intelligence Unit<br />Lateral checks are being conducted on all mobile telephone numbers identified within this apparent grouping.  IMEI searches underway to identify other SIMs that may be being/have been used by the subject/s  with their current handsets.<br />There is still no activation on any of the 5 numbers detailed above.<br />T*772 has not activated since the last text message either.<br />T*114 (Adbi MOHAMMED) has also not activated since switching off earlier.
1,13053,3147,13016,2342 Message 64 - C3000 staff<br />Search now complete at Flat 9, 17 FROBISHER STREET, SE15ET.  Results briefed to SIO.  Evidential image taken of hard-drive of occupant%u2019s PC and being developed by SO13 Hi-Tech Unit<br />Address is re-secured and under OP control

1,13058,3147,13055,0101 Message 66 - Intelligence Unit<br />Enquiries with Hotmail reveal that Akim77@hotmail.com is registered to:<br />Yusuf Salam MARWAN DOB 23/06/79 OF 10 SHERBORNE STREET, LONDON, W103JS.<br />The last 13 IP Logon numbers have also been obtained and these are being developed currently.<br />Initial enquiries indicate that the occupiers of number 10 are long-standing residents of British nationality with no apparent links to the operation at hand.  The details are believed to be bogus as Hotmail accounts do not require payment etc but the postcode does have to be correct.
1,13059,3147,13056,0158 Message 67 - Intelligence Unit<br />Some of the Akim77 hotmail recent IP Logons provided have been identified as follows:<br />-	three are attributed to computers purchased in bulk by the Easy Internet caf&eacute; company.  Exact locations await<br />-	one is attributed to the computer imaged at Frobisher St.  The timing of this correlates with an access identified by the HTU which occurred at 0857 the day before yesterday<br />-	three (including the most recent at 2057hrs)  are linked to a CLI which is T07957916418 (T-mobile prepay no details)<br />-	5 are show a CLI of T02073647820*** - one of these IPs was timed at 1955hrs by the Service Provider and this is the second most recent<br />***This is the landline at 6 SHERBORNE STREET<br />SIO briefed.
1,13060,3147,13057,0232 Message 68 - Intelligence Unit<br />T07957916418 data already obtained and appears to be used for Internet dial-up only by the user.  The handset however is intermittently used with the T*772 SIM and the inference would be that the SIMs are used by the same subject for these different functions.  The cellsite for T*418 when the dial-up occurred at 2057 hrs was in N174UL but this is the only time this cell  - or this postal area - has featured on the cellsite data for either SIM
1,13068,3150,13067,0920hrs<br />Liaison immediately established with BSS and duty staff requested to attend C3000 to form part of Fusion cell next-door to Room 498.  Service requested to respond immediately as to whether there is any current operation and/or threat intelligence which might have a bearing on the events reported. (Nothing at this stage)<br />G1 duty lead warned to anticipate request for fast-time assistance with interception warrantry and to take whatever steps possible to ensure that this can be achieved expeditiously when appropriate.  Appropriately security cleared DS line-reader briefed and stood-by to attend Thames House to ensure any resultant product is immediately conveyed back to Rm 499 (line readers room) in C3000.<br />SO12 C3000 staff to ensure that any and all details that are ascertained about this possible cell are immediately searched through all relevant databases at SO12 upon receipt.  BSS reps will be asked to ensure the same in relation to their databases.  Sanitisations and form of words will not be accepted. This information will not form part of the CLIO log nor be stored on any networked system but will be factored into the overall assessment conducted by the combined Rm 498 Intel team and briefed to the SIO/DSO as part of a single holistic intelligence picture.<br />SCD TSU warned by SIO to establish a presence in C3000 pending possible deployment.  Relevant assets put on stand-by.<br />Initial assessment from SO13 Bomb Data Centre is that without further details it is too difficult to predict what might have been decanted.  Clearly there are descriptive similarities (yellow liquid/containers/rucksacks) with the July attacks of last year and these devices transpired to be peroxide-based explosives.  If this is the case, certainly TATP versions are known to be highly volatile; although in terms of risk to the public, much depends on the mix, volumes, concentration, containment and possible fragmentation/shrapnel features of whatever has been constructed.<br />For information only at this stage: a recent search of a hotel room in Northern England found a rucksack with a plastic bucket of yellow liquid in it left behind by the room occupiers.  Fast-time work conducted by the Intel team at the time found that the persons who had rented the room had pre-cons for fraud offences and when tested this fluid transpired to be that known to be used in so-called Black money scams.<br />1047 hrs<br />Location of bus stop passed to SO12 and BSS for assessment re any possible known North-East African subjects residing in this area.  SO13 to search HOLMES database re this general area (no trace).<br />Speculative research on MPS databases initiated by Rm 498 staff to identify possible Somalian nationals living within this area.  Too many hits at this stage.<br />1135 hrs<br />Abdi MOHAMMED has, according to BSS, also featured on the periphery of two other covert operations since the joint police/BSS Operation (QUIVER) detailed above.  In each of these other ops - neither of which has reached the stage of executive action yet - he features as a peripheral contact/associate of the main cell as opposed to being integral to their early stage attack planning.  Nevertheless, due to his featuring in three ops now, he is considered a medium risk development target.   There is no intelligence to indicate that his associations as mentioned here are relevant to this incident.  The ethnicities of the main subjects of the other two operations do not match those of the subjects seen by witnesses today.  BSS can confirm though that as recently as February, Abdi MOHAMMED was still believed to be in possession of the T*114 mobile.<br />1230 hrs<br />In light of SIOs decision to prioritise intel gathering on Abdi MOHAMMED and in addition to the OP and call data work; BSS consulted re acquiring an interception warrant on T*114 in order to provide coverage of his activities.<br />1440 hrs<br />SALAMEH has been identified by BSS as one of a number of attendees at an Islamist training camp that was held in the Brecon Beacons back in September 2005.  The good image of Subject 3 extracted from the CCTV today has been compared with sensitive images of SALAMEH both from surveillance imagery of the camp.  The CCTV image is very good but not quite suitable for facial recognition software techniques to be employed (the image must be head-on whilst this is slightly at an angle).<br />SALAMEH appears to be part of a private prayer circle according to BSS intelligence with some of the members being linked to both a mosque on UXBRIDGE ROAD, SHEPHERDS BUSH and also a gym in the LATIMER ROAD area.  The camp he attended was organised by Sheikh Abu MAHMOUD and involved the attendees hiking considerable distances across heavy ground in silence and praying regularly for prolonged periods. MAHMOUD is a known radical Islamist cleric who has peripheral links to several cells disrupted by BSS/SO operations but has never been tangibly linked to attack planning himself.  SALAMEH himself does not feature in any operation other than by way of his attendance at the camp mentioned above.  A mobile number attributed to him at the time (ie September) the camp trip was being organised has been provided as T07931533790.<br />BSS have dispatched a form of words reflecting all the above to us by CLUSTER and this will be copied to the SIO for his/her sensitive decision log.  A request has been made for the details and images of the other camp attendees to be passed to the Intelligence cell for them to compare with images/data in this op.<br />1500 hrs<br />First line feed from T*114 (Abdi MOHAMMED) indicates the user is female and speaking in as yet unidentified foreign language (blvd possible a North African dialect)  Transcription and translation in hand via G Branch.<br />1525 hrs<br />T07931533790 has been passed to BSS for interception (despite apparent inactivity).
1,13069,3150,13067,1641 hrs<br />An assessment of call traffic on the T*114 phone indicates that this is a female speaking in a  North-East African dialect similar to Tigrinya (Eritrean).  Translation is slow but initial feed is that of very generic conversation with what appears to be family/friends<br />JOVETICA/K is no trace any systems.  Feedback from the earlier request to BSS re the Brecon Beacons camp however indicates that there was imagery taken by the surveillance team at that time of an IC1 male (described as having Balkan/East European appearance ) This image is with the Intel team and could be ident with JOVETIK and does not preclude a match with the CCTV images of Subject 4.<br />All IMEIs/IMSIs have been passed to TSU<br />All numbers detailed thus far are now on live trace even if blvd inactive<br />1650 hrs<br />Mr JENKINS, the landlord at FROBISHER STREET has assisted the SO12 CTIO previously on more than one occasion in relation to covert enquiries about the residents of the location and has proven himself trustworthy in that capacity.<br />An approach can be made to ascertain if JOVETIKs room at Flat 9 (they are all studio style flats in the same block) is currently occupied and, as fire warden for the building Mr JENKINS can provide ready access without notice to the residents rooms to assist with a covert search if required<br />SIO authorizes initial contact by Ops team (thru CTIO) to assess feasibility of progress on this<br />1715 hrs<br />There is a clear inference here that a group of individuals is engaged in some form of operational security measure to evade monitoring<br />All six numbers are now on live trace with the service providers and emergency interception warrants are being applied for  in relation to all given the handset link to SALAMEH and initial cellsite findings etc<br />All IMSIs are being obtained and passed to TSU and Fusion cell<br />TSU have requested research packages on the neighbouring premises to 6 SHERBORNE STREET to assess the feasibility of technical attacks on this location to maximise intelligence<br />1804 hrs<br />Call made by 989 into 523 number details as follows:<br />African sounding male voice on former speaks to female with middle-eastern accent on latter.  A very short english conversation ensued in which the male stated that they were coming home now and asked if everything was okay; to which she answered yes.  The male said he would speak more soon and then rang off.<br />1943 hrs<br />The T*772 phone texted the following message to T*887 at 1933hrs:<br />Pls call me Akeem<br />The text from T*524 to T*772 within the next few minutes was blank.<br />The T*772 number is traced at BSS and linked to two other ongoing covert ops targeting Islamist extremist cells - neither at attack stage and not bearing similarities to this group.  There is no attribution at this stage ad previous data obtained by BSS indicates very sporadic usage and again high proportion of text messages.  The number is peripheral to the Ops mentioned and the user is not believed to be a strong associate hence the lack of available information.  The details of the previous contact with T*007 and T*790 are not known.<br />This number will be put on intercept also as soon as practicable.<br />2100 hrs<br />TSU and BSS support can support the following.  T*523 and T*989 are switched on in the cell areas identified and appear to be within 6 SHERBORBNE STREET.  There is no trace of the other phones at this stage which could mean that they are switched off or at a different location but without activations (data-wise) no further input can be offered<br />Technical options re the possible internet usage within premises are being progressed but this will take time.<br />No listening devices have been able to be inserted at this stage<br />The FROBISHER street premises linked to JOVETIK is empty and in darkness.<br />2342 hrs<br />Flat 9, 17 FROBISHER STREET, SE15ET was relatively bare in d&eacute;cor although there were clear signs of blu-tac etc remaining from posters being removed from the walls.  There were some basic furnishings and clothing and some corres in the name of JOVETIK remaining but other than that there was only the PC.  The image taken of this computer is being examined now by the SO13 HTU and findings will be briefed to the SIO asap<br />0007 hrs<br />The HTU were tasked to provide an initial assessment of the drive retrieved and this has revealed that the user has been accessing hotmail regularly during the last few weeks: the account he seems to be accessing is -<br />Akim77@hotmail.com<br />This has been searched through BSS and all other databases without trace<br />TSU/BSS confirm that all but one (T*887) of the mobiles within the group of five are now switched off.  T*887 is still indicated as being fixed at its previous location but is inactive.<br />0237 hrs<br />Sensitive reporting/liaison with the Hotmail SP  confirms that the account name above was being accessed by the internet-user within 6 SHERBORNE STREET when the landline was occupied between 1950 and 2010 hrs and that the following saved draft was created by the user.<br />Message begins:<br />Assalamu Alaykum Akhi, am sorry to alarmed you<br />Do not fear I think our prayers together and your wisdom to me.  All are safe now but today was not ready for us.<br />Tonight we pray for tomorrow is for the Kuffir and pray for us, my akhi as we go to join my brother, inshaallah<br />Message ends<br />One previous draft remained on the account at the time the above was posted and it was posted by a user with the CLI  T07957916418<br />Message starts:<br />Akeem<br />What is wrong  I expected your journey would be well today<br />Please contact me I fear for you and our akhis<br />Message ends<br />T07957916418 will be subject to an interception application

Subjects leaving, either maintaining support of the surveillance or interception.<br />2. Containment and call out both close and distance.<br />3. Dynamic entry to recover evidnence and detain subjects.<br />I request authority for each team to conduct covert tactical planning through the OP and surveillance team leader.<br />At this time the firearms team will WAIT, and support covert surveillance

1,13157,3453,12969,Association chart would be helpful showing confirmed links vs unconfirmed info
1,13158,3434,12975,What is it about this that raises our suspiciouns as oposed to other incidnets more info required from experts

1,13180,3479,12947,Is there trained and accredited Bronze scenes, to act as liaison for the SIO and DSO
1,13181,3428,12970,I want SIO to set out for me exactly why this scenario raises tensons that are not normalt here. This couldbe a criminalnetwork or even ave a perfectly inncent explanation. I am time limitedhowever and need this information quickly. If this is a teroroistcell then we need to be getting resources into lae.
1,13182,3425,12972,phone numbers change - criminsality/terrorism could be either
1,13183,3490,13006,Authority for firearms?

1,13185,3490,13006,Are plans in place for the address - ie Sherbourne?
1,13186,3430,12976,Firstly when considering the situation we need to consdier the potential means of comms, secondly the language to be used and the opening lines.  What is the stratergy of the sio
1,13187,3490,13006,Any Firearms links?
1,13188,3428,12970,I do not yet consider this a Beach. I will continue to iaise with the SIO but at the mment beleve this is resolable using conventional tactics.

1,13219,3460,12944,Issues about the role of DSO SOP is not clear about role and talks about role to make decisions and take action to mitigrate the threat.. What does this mean
1,13220,3546,12977,Consider EXPO, LAS &amp; LFB advice at an early stage in cas the situation develops
1,13221,3439,12948,hostage crisis on call co-ordinator would like to be informed of the operation in order to be in a position to look at the potential sitations that may arise, to research the background of the suspects and to assess resource implications.

1,13230,3472,12960,Who is in charge ?
1,13231,3548,12966,Where is the silver hatchback?  ANPR and congestion camera system
1,13232,3440,12946,Role is to provide advice on non-firearms tactical support options to DSO and advise on national policy where applicable
1,13233,3472,12960,Is there a Command structure ?
1,13234,3548,12966,Task preparation of contigency packs
1,13235,3546,12977,Although we have intelligence gaps relating to what may be going on, it is important to consider putting resources and planning in place, should the situation develop in quick time.
1,13236,3440,12946,Discuss with CO19 TAC Advisor on options being considered
1,13237,3453,12965,At this stage I have requested contingency plans to be drawn up by the Firearms TAC advisors for the addresses identified and for foot &amp; mobile related incidents.
1,13238,3439,12948,potential containment / call out / siege situation at sherbourne.
1,13239,3480,12943,To summarise the position in relation to this operation. Team of 4 males split into teams of two each entered the Underground system having been seen decanting fluid into bottles placing them into rucksacks.<br />Two males now possibly identified as Suspect 1  Mohammed  and subject 3 Salameh. Suspect 3 possibly ident to Brecon Beacons training camp.<br />The subjects possibly identified also have links to other 13 ops.<br />Priorities1. Identify targets positively.<br />Forensicate the area where the fluid was decanted.<br />Full intelligence profile on subjects as we know them at present.<br />Consider options for covert or overt entry into Irfan Jovetica address. Risk assessment re entry.<br />SO19 Tactical options re address 9 Sherbourne Street. Rapid entry/intercept targets as they leave address/other persons going to the address.
1,13240,3453,12965,I am in liaison with the SIO and am monitoring incoming intelligence from the investigation.
1,13241,3443,13204,If SO12 surveillance teams are deployed on other operations then, (assuming the other ops are not more critical) I am sure they will be re-deployed after consultation with appropriate management.
1,13242,3440,12946,Consider evacuation options around 6 Sherborne Street to minimise potential casualties in case of detonation or firearms deployment
1,13243,3548,12977,Draft timeline chart
1,13244,3433,13179,finding either of these might enable us to test to identify the suspect fluid
1,13245,3546,12977,All planning and recces need to be considered in respect of keeping the on-going operation covert.<br />3rd party intell (ie photos,plans etc) may be all that is achievable at this stage
1,13246,3548,12977,Draft telephone association chart and analysis thereof
1,13247,3547,12947,Review of Options<br />1. Mobile armed support to surveillance is still the chosen option, there is no addition to the intelligence at this stage, therefore the chosen option does not change.<br />2. Distance containment and call out remains an option, and the planning is ongoing. Additional resources will be required for this option, EXPO, TP uniform and SO13 Kratos advisor for the evacuation if this is possible.<br />3. Dynamic entry remains a contingency option, planning is ongoing
1,13248,3548,12966,Draft timeline chart
1,13249,3547,12947,Request clear strategy statement from the SIO in relation to the intentions if any of the subjects leave the addresses.
1,13250,3548,12966,Draft telephone association chart and analysis thereof
1,13251,3440,12946,Consider contingencies and containment options - hostages taken, escape attempt, surrender etc. Police reception committee to be on stand by. Non leathal options, ie. Taser etc.
1,13252,3546,12965,Advise review of command structure and clarity of roles, in particular any fireams Bronze running with the SFO team
1,13253,3548,12966,Review of previous and current operations for relevant links
1,13254,3443,13191,All ways of confirming intel are being pursued, eg photographic intel cell are comparing all photos, all intel is being x-checked on our and partner databases. etc. Partner agencies are being asked about capabilities etc - eg internet capture etc
1,13255,3547,12947,Risk assessments being conducted in relation to the specific risks in addition to the CO19 toolbox risk assessments
1,13256,3443,13218,All data being cross checked on SO12 and partner agency databases.
1,13257,3548,12966,Require decision on redeployment of surveillance and other assets on Ops SORTIE, THRESHOLD and RECANT
1,13258,3440,12946,Be aware LAS and LFB will be required if this address involves active deployment. Consider possibility of &#039;dirty bomb&#039; and possible CBRN trained officers
1,13259,3462,12976,Command remains with SIO, intell being developed DSO activity contingency planning with CO19 fast time interventions, other considerations
1,13260,3548,12966,What was the nature of the training Abdi MOHAMMED
1,13261,3548,12966,Consider tasking of all MPSB and BSS sources
1,13262,3439,12948,is this a containment or a surveillance operation?<br />If containment what is the intention:-<br />CALL OUT<br />by SFO or Negs (use of negs may allow continuity if there is non compliance)<br />HOW TO CALL OUT<br />FACE TO FACE or REMOTE (phone)<br />Face to Face (Madrid)<br />Phone (creates distance, if devlops to longer term may be better option)<br />If subjects leave and contained on street Negotiators to support CO19 if non compliance results in stand off.<br />Negotations may be an option to but time and gain intelligence to assist with tactical option planning.<br />Initial negotiating on call out<br />Match energy of subject Orders-reassurance and information-Active listening bring subject down to calmer and stable level.   This applies to CO19 or negotiators.
1,13263,3480,12943,As of now I would request this be put to E.L.G.<br />The intelligence picture is such that we possibly have a terrorist cell active across London  Two subjects are thought to be held in an address Sherbourne Rd W10<br />OP in place to confirm activity at the address. I have no confirmation that this is where the targets are...<br />Containment plans for this address from CO19<br />Surveillance capacity required for subjects.<br />There appears at present to be two subjects within the W10 area possibly Sherbourne.<br />I need capacity to conduct surveillance with CO19 support on two targets. ie two teams whilst keeping a capacity at the address.
1,13264,3444,12944,Need clarity in the SOP re setting of strategy by ELG/Gold
1,13265,3448,12950,1.Exploit intelligence seized from computer<br />2.probes in premises?<br />3.Swab re explo traces<br />4.triangulate phones BSS?
1,13266,3448,12950,1.review immediate contingency plans - still viable?<br />2.Is operational strategy still viable?
1,13267,3454,12945,What is the threat assessment from Security Service and JTAC?
1,13268,3438,12963,Discussion<br />Roles of DSO, SIO and Co-ordinator<br />ELG devolved?<br />Number of suspects in main address<br />DSO makes decision re tactical option
1,13269,3547,12947,At this stage CO19 firearms are working to the instructions and strategy set by the SIO. Although the DSO is aware of the information, intelligence and tactics they are not assuming responsibility at this stage.
1,13270,3442,12949,We have four subjects - would the DSO be happy making four sets of decisions if four subjects went in different directions?
1,13271,3480,12943,There are currently 4 suspects within London all with potential explosive/CBRN devices.<br />I do not want an entry at present into Sherbourne RD<br />I do not want an interception of either of these subjects should both or either leave the address. Only armed surveillance with a CO19 team to follow the subjects and report back to C3000.
1,13272,3448,12950,1. JOT process to support SIO decision process
1,13273,3462,12975,CO19 put in place tactiacl options to deal with occupants
1,13274,3432,12959,How will the DSO record decisions made on the basis of sensitive intelligence?
1,13275,3442,12949,Decisions: - No entry at this stage.  Co19 to identify and follow if necessary.  Q - If they have ruck sacks, do we stop them away from the address?
1,13276,3546,12977,request authority from DAC for EMOE as a tactical option
1,13277,3445,12956,Reiew tactical options
1,13278,3462,12975,? who needs what at this stage, SIO CO19 considering product and unknown risk<br />To DSO do you need to consider having second DSO<br />Aims of ELG need to be known<br />Consider option re F/arms and various optionso
1,13279,3442,12949,How we review our intelligence will determine our decisions.  We must make decisions on what we have got.
1,13280,3450,13252,command structure;<br />gold - cmdr mcdowell<br />silver - investigation sio ball<br />silver firearm dso cmdr hitchcock<br />bronze investigation - .....<br />bronze firearms - .....<br />at this stage the strategy is to continue to develop intelligence, and continue covert operations including covert surveillance on persons leaving addresses.
1,13281,3442,12949,All options must now be documented and plans drawn up.
1,13282,3462,12975,Intrusive surveillance to establish, who where and level of threat re substance etc<br />How is a breakout going to be managed?<br />Look at resources available, all resourrces considering number ofpossibleaddresses etc
1,13283,3442,12949,Can we do anything at he premisies now before it gets too late?
1,13284,3442,12949,We must try to improve our intelligence picture.  The scenarios will be constantly updated.
1,13285,3547,12947,Protocols for interception or entry to the premises required now, so the  operational teams are under no misunderstanding relating to their roles or options
1,13286,3462,12975,Conflict of DSO assisting in tatical approach with SIO<br />Issues re if they go mobile, &#039;line in the sand&#039; with directions as to actions with options<br />considering this may comprehensive job
1,13287,3438,12963,Discussion re tactical options:<br />Covert evacuation<br />Blow door and call out from distance<br />Negotiation from Jenkyl<br />military option via ELG<br />All plans and resources would be in place<br />DSO considers suspects are suicide bombers. Risk of compromise and public safety and time of day. Consider EXPO advice.
1,13288,3462,12975,Consider HNC
1,13289,3442,12949,There will come a stage where the CSO will ask for tactical options in order to preserve life.
1,13290,3448,12950,1.intelligence assessment on content of mail<br />2.Tactical option review re entry/call out re address<br />3.Confirm containment of venue<br />4.Evac options
1,13291,3462,12975,From HNC consider contact, after containment, then isolate and cal out.
1,13292,3442,12949,General discussion on options and C &amp; C.
1,13293,3462,12975,Preconditions in place as to whether they will comply, consider options
1,13294,3453,12965,Silver investigation/ Silver Firearms have consulted - it is our opinion at this stage that there is a potential threat to public and our advise to Gold is that at this stage we should carry out arrests to disrupt the planning potential of the incident
1,13295,3546,12977,Options surrounding the address need consideration,<br />Evacuation, containment and call out<br />Pros;<br />safest method<br />Cons:<br />difficult to evacuate covertly<br />may precipitate &#039;Madrid&#039;<br />may result in disposal of evidence<br />may result in contamination of evidence<br />possible siege<br />Dynamic Entry to secure readily disposable evidence, that poses a threat to life<br />pros;<br />more likely to secure evidence<br />more likely to prevent a &#039;Madrid&#039;, unless booby trapped or subjects ready to &#039;go&#039;<br />cons;<br />may provoke confrontation<br />may be high risk
1,13296,3480,12943,The position has now developed to the extent that the messages have now been picked up on the computers.<br />My assessment is now such that the possibilities of there being a cell of at least four suicide bombers in London.<br />Two possibly within the Sherbourne Rd address. At least two elsewhere, position unknown.<br />My position is such that should we put an interecption into the address now, I do not know who is in there what if any explosives are in there or what contact they have with other suspects.
1,13297,3453,12969,CO19 TAC advisor outlines advantages of dynamic entry, especially if occupants are caught unaware.
1,13298,3453,12969,CO19 advisor - highlights difficulties in carrying out a covert evacuation   likelihood that police activity would be noticed and could precipitate a &#039;Madrid&#039; scenario
1,13299,3440,12946,Bearing the time of day in mind, there may be a requirement for additional resources in terms of personnel at short notice to assist with evacuation, form cordons etc
1,13300,3453,12969,SIO - suggests that there needs to be a contingency for someone leaving the premises in the preparatory stages of a dynamic entry
1,13301,3462,12975,On containment, whilst sufficient to detain<br />will use the time to concentrate on our resources to ensure all covered, eg evacuate premises tech update.<br />Arrest strategy remains if l ife at risk
1,13302,3453,12969,Consideration re potential risks vs safeguarding evidence
1,13303,3453,12969,^SIO - Is dynamic entry a realistic option?
1,13304,3453,12969,DSO - feels that dynamic entry is the safest option but contingencies need to developed to deal with unfolding scenario
1,13305,3462,12975,HNC - based on Golds decision stragey on if one leave sthe prems they will be detained, premises require covert detainment which will lead to isolation, covert evacuation of persons at risk. At the same time a tech. attack on prems to ascertian threat level. At any time need emergency resoponse re occupants. Suggets 2 neg cells , 1, with CO19 for potentail face to face, 1, availble to ring prems when decision made for a call out. In summary contain, isolate, evacuate and negotiate.
1,13306,3453,12969,CO19 TAC advisor would provide plans for both options : dynamic entry or containment &amp; call out
1,13307,3445,12956,Plan<br />objective - contain, disrupt and isolate<br />At this time the message may be interpreted as farewell messge and the view of SIO is that a disruption tactic should be undertaken to prevent any risk.<br />Simultaneous hits on all known addresses.<br />Parallel intel gathering on outstanding targets.<br />Review tactical options with DSO, tac advisor.
1,13308,3546,12977,If it is safe to do so,<br />No booby traps<br />stable explosives<br />covert evacuation possible<br />entry likely<br />EMOE<br />Dynamic Entry would be my preferred option
1,13309,3438,12963,SIO and DSO decide on plan, with input of advisors:<br />Aim to maximise investigative opportunity with public safety priority.<br />SIO wants to arrest now.<br />DSO and SIO agreed on tactical option:<br />Rapid intervention to secure evidence and arrest occupants. Element of surprise should prevent pre-emptive activity to prepare improvised devices<br />Contingencies in place for individuals exiting premises before rapid intervention.<br />Issues<br />Evidential opportunity inside premises<br />short timescale before anticipated exit<br />low level of intel. re bomb factory and safety of neighbours and officers<br />tracing *772<br />covert evacuation vs element of surprise
1,13310,3546,12977,Contingencies need to be considered supporting the static option, ie<br />mobile and foot options should the subjects come out of the address on foot or go to a vehicle.<br />At this stage on the available intelligence I would advise a &#039;Pluto&#039; option.
1,13311,3469,12967,consider hostage negotiater to scene
1,13312,3462,13282,Consider LAS, LFB, LA re dealing with tactiacl problems which will arise as result of actions taken.
1,13313,3469,12967,Get as much detail about premises as possible -live cctv from OP if poss.
1,13314,3448,12950,1.Request detention of contained suspects<br />2.discuss expansion of interdiction to include other address<br />3.discuss parallel intel devlopment of o/s suspects and dynamic options for interdiction i.e. veh/foot/other force etc<br />4.Identify DSO fully briefed on intel<br />5.Forensic strategy<br />6.Continued intel operation
1,13315,3501,12955,Contain<br />The scene.<br />Isolate<br />The stronghold so that those inside cannot communicate with those outside (except police)<br />Evacuate<br />Those in dangerous locations (neighbours, etc)<br />Negotiate<br />Seek a safe surrender.

Mr Zaman and Mr Jones both have a criminal history and a third party has now entered into the mix in the shape of Mr Hassain(?). with regards to the outbreak of illness mr hassain may be a suspect so should be tracked down as he has a history with chemical weapons.

Their has also been a disturbance btetween two neighbours who both claim that the other shot at them one for racial hatred the other for simply being too noisey. The first man a white man supposedly suggested that his neighbours was carrying out terrorist activities whilst the other nighbour seeminly of a different origin was claiming the attack was unprovocked yet surely the racial hatred/ terrorist activity was to sway who would be charged for this disturbance.<br />The number of cases of food poisoning has occurrred at nearly all of the major hospitals around the areas of liverpool

1,13512,3702,13443,TURN 3: I now know the locations of the patients and where the main fatalitys have been and i have noticed that the fatalities tend to be in very close proximity to eachother with patient numbers and fatalities decresinbg in numbers as they move further away from this area. i have also learned of a disagreemement between two men over a garden fence with the english man claminig the asian man of being part of a terroist organisation and talking of suspicious acts.  This has not been confirmed and the statement from the asian man contradicts the english mans so this will need to be looked into further.  I dont think this arguement has anything to do with the recent poisonings in the area but it definately worth doublechecking especially if one of the men owns a gun and has threatened to kill the other.  I need to know more about the tests at the hospital and more about this dispute between the two men
1,13513,3703,13441,Turn 3<br />Fatalities have increased dramatically and are occuring over a wide area. Allegations of terrorist cell activity have been made in the area by a neighbour who seems to have rowed with another over the positioning of a garden fence. Investigations into both Keith Jones and his neighbour need to be conducted in order to asseratin whether the neighbour has actually done anything wrong, or if Mr. Jones is simply irritated with him and is flinging accusations around to cause trouble. If evidence of terrorist activity is found, this needs to be further investigated to see if it concerns biological weaponary. Further investigation into the specifics of the bacteria need to continue in order for treatment to begin.
1,13514,3699,13441,turn 3- i know that the number of fatalities has increased dramatically, the situation is escalating, with the locality of the victims being widespread across liverpool. There has been a police report by a Keith Jones, who suspects his neughbour, Mr Zaman is involved with terrorist behaviour- i think this could be linked with the illnesses. Inow think the incident could be a terrorist biological attack. I need to know more about Mr Zaman, especially a detailed account of his whereabouts for the past month.

1,13518,3701,13441,TURN 3:<br />There has been an incident between Mr Zaman and Mr Jones. They provide totally contradicting accounts of the incident. However, Mr Jones submitted his account as evidence so he is liable to prosecution if its wrong whereas Mr Zaman submitted his account through an &#039;Incident Reporting&#039; form which he could possibly lie on without facing prosecution.<br />From Mr Jones&#039; account it appears Mr Zaman is involved in Extremist Terrorism. He could possibly been behind the food poisoning.<br />Mr Zaman needs to be put under surveillance to identify any suspicious activity that he may be involved in.
1,13519,3702,13442,TURN 3: 40% - This information has gave me a greater understanding of where the main poisoniings have taken place and they seem to have spread from a small area outwards.  The information about the dispute between neighbours is not really useful at this moment in time.
1,13520,3700,13441,turn 3: we now know the problem is significantly bigger and has the potential to be a deliberate act. However there is no link between the persons in the incident report and the poisoning as yet. Both witnesses contradict each other also and will require further interviewing to assess who may be guiltly of the anti-social behaviour. We could do with knowing if the man is recieving packages in the night and if so what they are as this is slightly unusual activity but not illegal. It is also noticable that there are more poisonings closer to the mersey than there are away from it suggesting that that is where it is coming from.

1,13522,3708,13441,turn 3- have now seen a map of the positions of the hospitals and the figures of patients admitted under the symptoms we are looking for, along with the fatalities of those admitted under these symptoms who later died. this appears to be very widespread across liverpool and wirral, with little correlation between the areas and the percentages of people affected. need to find a source of this problem. also have infromation regarding a seemingly irrelevant feud between neighbours
1,13523,3700,13442,Turn 3: seems like two different incidents so only 40%
1,13524,3702,13443,TURN 3: Because of the two statements and the mention of terrorism i have placed the asian man at around a 10% risk of being the suvject with this needing to be looked into further.  The distribution of the poisonings has also strengthened by idea that the poisoning could be coming from a water supply, restaurant of supermarket so for these i now i now give a combined estimate of around 50%.

1,13528,3703,13443,Turn 3<br />This is beginning to look like deliberate action, due to the large number of cases reported. My suspicions are beginning to look to a terrorist organization (60% guilty). Another possibility is a water company that is not properly cleaning the water (70% guilty)

Mr Jones is reportedly and nice and intelligent man, hwoever he is a chemistry teacher which means he may have an upper hand when creating chemicals/poison which could have caused this. Mr Hussein also has a criminal record and is reported to have said that he wants non believers killed by poison. Need prove that it is true he has said this, whether Mr zaman or Mr Jones were there and have contact with mr hussein

1,13537,3706,13441,Turn 4- There has either been a mass outbreak of poisonous curry! or something is ary. The autopsy has confirmed that some type of posoning has been present in one of the victims of the fatalieis that has been present at the royals Liverpool hospital. Keith worked very hard apparently in a flour factory and as an ex chemistry teacher had prime access to spreading chemicals throughout the area of merseyside by poisoning the flour. Similarly the relgious fundementalist seems to be up there with poisoning the city and the shezah character seems to favour this relgious movement. He could have been plotting with the help of others to poison the city of liverpool through various food outlets following the directs of the fundamentalist leaders however this could plurly be conjecture relying on the investigating officers racism to try and lean to blaming these individuals as the criminals.

1,13540,3702,13441,TURN 4: I have now found out about a Mr Hussein who has been talking about spreading poison throughout the city in extremist speeches in a mosque.  This is very worrying as it seems to correspond with the patterns of the poisoning.  The autoopsy suggests that this is not food poisoning at all and the fatalities on the mass scale has led me to beliieve that this is not a food chain but some sort of terorist plot.  I think that the asian man questioned earlier about the dispute with his neighbour may be working with this Mr Hussein and spreading poison throughout the city with a chemical weapon or some sort of poison distributed through some means widely used.  I need to know more information about Mr Hussein and suggest questioning him and finding out further blood tests and reports to find out what substance is causing the fatalities and then check this in both mens homes.  I also know Mr Jones dabbles with chemistry and has allegedly given death threats so this also needs to be followed up.
1,13541,3699,13443,turn 4- I know autopsies have been carried out, confirming that organ failure was the cause of death. I know Keith Jones and Mr Zaman have no criminal record concerning extremism or chemical poisioning however<br />another suspect, Mr Hussein has been identified, who has been in prison for producing a chemical weapon. I think Keith Jones, as an ex-chemistry teacher has the knowledge to produce a poision of this magnitude.I need to know the three suspects detailed movements.
1,13542,3702,13442,TURN 4: 75% - I believe that this is a widespread attack on the city with poison

1,13544,3703,13441,Turn 4<br />Chance of terrorism seems increasingly likely. Investigations have discovered a local radical Islamic cleric has been delivering extremist speeches in a Liverpool mosque. He has a previous conviction of terrorist activity, which was possesing element of a chemical weapon. His speeches have included segments about killing &quot;non-believers&quot; by spreading poison through the city. More investigations into this man must follow.<br />A friend of Keith Jones has been interviewed, and has given a shining report of him. He has only one previous conviction, having sex with a minor, and no history of public disturbances. His neighbour on the other hand, has a string of nuisance offences, has served time in prison for resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer. He has also ben fined for weapon possession, which further leads me to believe that he is the one who fired upon the fence between the two neighbours. Follow up investigations should be conducted.
1,13545,3702,13443,TURN 4: Mr Hussein 70%, The other asian man 60%, Mr Jones 15%, food chain/water company 5%

1,13548,3701,13441,The illness appears to be caused by a poison that causes multiple organ failure. The illness is only reported in the Liverpool area so it could be linked to water supply.<br />Mr Jones&#039; eyewitness account appears to be verified by a character description, and from Mr Zaman&#039;s police record he has already been convicted of assault along with various other charges. Also, Mr Zaman has been convicted for possession of a firearm so it is likely that he is the one who shot a hole in the fence.<br />A Mr Hussein has been holding public speeches in which he encourages Muslims to kill non-believers, possibly by using poison. On his criminal record he has been convicted for making chemicals with intent to harm.<br />From Mr Zaman&#039;s police record it is very clear that he is a very suspicious character. He has been convicted several times, which have resulted in imprisonment.<br />It appears that Mr Zaman and Mr Hussein are linked in a terrorist plot but evidence showing the two are linked needs to be found. Also, a possible search of Mr Zaman&#039;s recidence would be useful if it found any items linked to the poison.

One has been involved with chemicals before and could easily have caused the mass number of casualties. On a side note, Keith has been convicted for sex with a minor and is spending a lot of time with a 15 year old girl. We now need to calculate a date for when the water may have been poisoned and track whether the suspects were in the area.

1,13581,3702,13441,TURN 5: with the closure of the factory where both the asian man and mr jones work causing uproar recently it lead me to belive that my initial concerns were correct and i now belive that it was a local food company at fault.  Granted the company probably did not know but this flower factory appears to be the source of the poisonings around liverpool.  The tension bewtween mr jones and the asian man may have overflowed into their private life but the offender profile and evidence gathered at his property suggests that Mr jones is guilty of this crime.  I want this to be investigated further and find out whether there are any traces of poison in his property and indeed in the flour factory.  This facotry distributes around the liverpool area and beyond and would explain why the main fatalities are near by but there are aslo some in the immediate surroundings.  I believe the &#039;recipe&#039; found in the home of Mr Jones is one for poison which he is using in the factory either top vejnt his unhapiness at the closing down of the facory, some sort of personal attack on the asian man or just through general misbehaviour.  I would like his property to be checked aswell as the facotry and then further autopsies done to determine if there is poison and if it is what is killling the patients.  The offender profile fits the suspect and subsequent evidence leads me to believe that he is behind the recent spate of poisonings.
1,13582,3703,13441,Turn 5<br />Further investigation has lead to the discovery of incriminating materials in the home of Keith Jones. These materials, and the instructions found with them in Jones&#039; handwriting, seem to be able to be used for creating biological agents. However, this is going beyond my knowledge, and investigation into what exactly Jones was making needs to be conducted.<br />Mr Shaman, Jones&#039; neighbour, worked at a local flour facotry until its recent closure, according to the Liverpool echo. This would have provided an opportunity to widely distribute a biological agent into the population. Investigations into the accuracy of the Echo&#039;s report must be made.<br />I seem to remember reading evidence that highighted Jones worked in a flour production or something, and this evidence must be re-examined. It may suggest innocent intentions of owning the materials found in Jones&#039; house, if he was a baker of some sort, but suspicions should remain high, as his former career as a chemistry teacher may have given him knowledge of how to produce biological agents.<br />Further investigation into Mr Hussein should also be conducted. His preachings and previous conviction do not bode well.
1,13583,3702,13442,TURN 5: 95% sure that this is a widespread poisoning through a poison put in food/drink in the area.  Not everything is totally clear but i have a good idea of what has happened i think
1,13584,3699,13443,turn 5- possible suspects:<br />Keith Jones- ricin making equipment was found in his house, he has recently lost his job. 65% guilty<br />Mr Zaman- he has extremism tendencies, he appears to fit the offender profile. 55% guilty.<br />Mr Hussein- has produced a chemical weapon in the past. 40% guilty.
1,13585,3701,13441,TURN 5:<br />Poison-making equipment and instructions have been found at Mr Jones&#039; residence, which clearly suggests he is the creator of the poison that is causing the illness and the resulting fatalities. Mr Jones&#039; knowledge from being a chemistry teacher would suggest he is able to produce a poison using ingredients that are less harmful. The poison that Mr Jones has instructions for needs to be compared with the poison that is causing the illness. If the 2 poisons are the same then Mr Jones is most likely behind the illness and therefore responsible for the fatalities. However, this completely goes against his character reference, and a the psychological profile of the criminal (provided by a forensic psychologist).<br />No more information was provided about Mr Hussein.<br />Mr Zaman was involved in violent protests at the flour mill but nothing that links him to the poison.
1,13586,3708,13441,turn 5 - have been given an offenders report for something, the description matches mr zahman, one of the angry neighbours from earlier. turns out he was also recently made redundent from his job. in a search of his neighbours house however, equipment, ingredients and what appears to be instructions on how to make some kind of poisen,could be wrong tho. long shot, but mr 15 goldstrum avenue could have maliciously tried to get mr zahman fired by contaminating or poisening the flour company for which mr zahman worked for, who distributed flour widely accross liverpool and wales . . . .

Still need to know more background on the actions of Mr Hussein and also on the reasons as toi why Mr Jones has such items in his home.

I think that it could have been mr jones that caused the fatalities leading me to believe that mr zaman was telling the truth in his report of the neighbourly dispute. mr jones could have done it due to annoyance at his redunduncy and poor pay out. we need to know whther the equipment in mr jones&#039; house wasthe equipment that caused the deaths. 10

1,13726,3721,13613,It is believed that Mr.Jones may have an involvement in the cause of this food poisoning outbreak. As initially suspected, the source of the outbreak may be due to a food source of some sort. Suspicious items were recovered from the house of mr.Jones and these are believed to have been used in the production of a poison. As Mr.Jones has been working in the flour factory, it could be possible that he has contaminated the flour, which has then gone on to poison many of the people who have used this flour.<br />Mr.Jones may have commited this to protest as to the closure of the flour factory, or to make it look as if it was the acts of an &#039;enemy&#039; of his, by making it appear as if it was a terrorist act of some sort.<br />It would be necessary to get reasons as to Mr.Jones&#039; posession of these items, as there may be a logical reason.

I know that the offender profile states that it is a male, aged 20-30 as well as other offender information.<br />I think I know that Mr Zaman is involved in angry rioting at the flour factory. I think I know that Mr Jones has the necessary skills and equipment to cause the poisioning of Liverpool.<br />I need to know why the equipment and instructions were at Mr Jones&#039; house.

1,13838,3781,13781,turn 5, participant 3.<br />A character investigation was launched to attempt to find the character of the suspect. It was found to be male, aged aprox 20-30 and not very social towards others. Wanting to oppose his own beliefs on others and not accept those of others.<br />Tools that could be used to produce ricin were found at Mr Jones home when police went to investigate the shooting in the fence. Although these tools could make the poisin it may not mean it was him as he is a chemistry teacher and been helping his daughter with her science project. It could be down to a coincidence.<br />The investigation suggests that the suspect will live within 5-10 minutes of the liverpool city centre and this is true of the two men as they are both in the L8 area.<br />I need to know the actions of the two men around the times of the casualties.

Ricin is a toxic poison from the beans of the castor plant. The report detailed that the levels of Ricin indicated that malicious, intentional poisioning had taken place. Patients need to be treated quickly through taking charcoal to clear the stomach and through a drip. If treatment is not administered then death will occur within 38-70 hours of Ricin entering the system.

I think that the second statement about his neighbour arguing for land, is slightly more belivable as this is often a common topic of argument within neighbours. However we need to investigate further into what time the woman got back from holiday, to check that she had got home late etc. Also need to investigate if you can find out which side the bullet was fired into the fence. Also search the houses for a gun. Also need to look into these people going round to the mans house, perhaps by an under cover servailence. Then interview the people to see if they are related to the poisioning incidents,also look into what the large packages contain that the neighbour described.

It is increasingly important to find out the cause of the infection before it becomes uncontrollable. Measures need to be taken to stop it spreading.<br />A witness statement has been filed from a male on Garlston? Road. He claims that his neighbour has been acting oddly and irrationally. An arguement broke out over the positioning of the witnesses garden fence. Apparantly, the neighbour became angry when the witness insisted the land was his and had even had it checked out with the council. The neighbour then threatened to kill him. He told his wife and kids to sleep elsewhere for that night. The neighbour then filed an incident report claiming that he became frustrated with the other man becasue he was being noisy. The argement broke out, but this man didnt make reference to the issue of the garden fence. He claims that it was the other man who threatened to kill him so he went inside and told his family not to move. Both men claim that eachother was in possession of a gun, and shot a hole in the garden fence.

There have been allegations by one Keith Jones that his neighbour, One S Zarif, is involved in extremist Islamic terrorist activity. Following an argument over land, Mr Jones alleges that Mr Zarif threatened to kill him and his family, to repay them for supporting the Iraq war, and later shot a hole in the fence separating their land. He also alleges that groups of men with large packages have been seen visiting the house of Mr Zarif in the early hours of the morning Mr Zarif alleges that mr Jones threatened to kill him to shut him up, after politely asking mr Jones to quiet himself after making noise while Mr Zarif was trying to recover from jet lag after returning from Pakistan. He also alleges that Mr Jones fired the shot through the fence.<br />It is important that corroboration is found for one of these two stories, and that it is ascertained if either of these two own a gun.

Police reports have been carried out on some of the perons mentioned so far. For example, a friend of the man mentioined in the &#039;witness&#039; statement has been helpiong his daughter with her chemistry coursework, which may have links to an infection, and has been working alot at a flour factory, perhaps substances could be traced from the factroy - this is a common product, eaten by many people every day. A report was also done on the nightbour of this man, who appears to have many previous convictions. However, the witness has also committed an offense. Other evidence suggests that a muslim man is threatening to poison non-believers and has a previous coinviction of use with chemicals.

It has also emerged that one Mr Mohammed Hossain of the Al-rahma mosque has been promoting the killing of non-believers through poisoning, and previously been convicted of offences related to chemical weapons.<br />The autopsy results are consistent with ricin poisoning.<br />It is important to know whether mr Zaman has attended the al-Rahma mosque and heard mr Hossain promote the poisoning of non-believers. it is also important to know whether either of these two had the means to make ricin, and the identities of any men that might have visited mr Zaman at his home as alleged by Mr Jones.

I also know that both Mr Jones and Mr Zaman work at the flour factory which is due for closure, meaning both will lose their jobs, however Mr Zaman is seen to be defending the rights of those who work with him, rather than participating in the violence which is occuring at the factory. Which is against his past history of being involved in acts of criminal damage. I also know that a number of suspicious objects have been found at the home of Mr Jones along with a handwritten flow chart of how to make Ricin, the substance used to poison people in the area.<br />I think I know that Mr Jones is a man who gets very passionate about things which affect him personally, such as losing his job, and so has a motive, along with the equipment to be carrying out the poisonings.<br />I need to know if there have been any traces of Ricin found on any part of Mr Jones&#039; property or person.

Also, which the previsous conviction of sexual behaviour with a minor.<br />A newspaper report reveals how the factory has shut down due to loss of profit and employees dissatisfaction with pay. It also appears that Mr.Zaman - the man metnioned in the incidence report was employed by the factory as head of medicine?<br />Both houses were searched for the shotgun but no evidence was found. However, in Mr.Jones house, several items were siezed e.g. pestle and motor, blotting paper, rubber gloves etc... a recipe for a substance beginning with R was found with his handwriting.

1,14279,3825,14201,turn 5 number 9<br />i am now more inclined to think that keith jones may have been the offender.this is firstly because i found out that the factory where he worked has been shut down so this may have been a reason for him to get very angry and therfore carry out the shooting.also equipment has been found in his house wich suggest that he has been making some kind of substance which cotains castor which is what was in the poison that has been killing people.it also makes me think that the extra hours he was working at the factory were to pay for the ingrediants for his mixture and not for paying off his mortgage.however i still need to try and find out which way the gun was shot and where the exactly the bullet was found because this will help us find out who it was.i also need to get hold of some of the stuff that keith jones has been making so that it can be sent off to be tested so we can find out if it matches the stuff that has been killing people.howver i do still think that zammer may be involved because of his previous offences and that mohammed also may be involved becayse he said he wanted to poison non believers.

1,14351,3856,14339,Individual officers are left to sort out their own balance. If you don&#039;t the job will just take and take
1,14352,3853,14328,The problem with management being that those that want to get on in an upward direction will do. Their career (and, by association, their welfare) is more important to them than mine is to them so whilst they may pay lip service to my role they are only interested in their own career development. Whilst that may be understandable, the ambition of those wanting promotion should be to do as good a job as possible at that rank than a tick box culture to reach their next rank.
1,14353,3864,14345,do people have any choice in who supervises them?
1,14354,3865,14342,is the lack of support lack of on the job resources such as health nurses or is it a matter of supervisors not being available

1,14356,3865,14302,Are there specific duties that you enjoy doing?
1,14357,3856,14302,More luck than judgement. It all depends on who you work with. If you are fortunate enough to work with officers you get along with and like the job is made more bearable and maybe even enjoyable from time to time.
1,14358,3859,14339,this causes problems for officers left on the shift day to day shift pattern as they have to work twice as hard to cover for people working flexible time

1,14362,3856,14345,You have no choice regarding supervision. Certain roles/departments have a high turnover of supervisors
1,14363,3855,14303,Recognition in the work place is little and very infrequent.  Doing a good job means nothing, but make a mistake and everybody wants to speak with you.  Fortunately colleagues work as a team and we help and support each other with no involvement from supervision.  An example of poor recognition from management is when letters of appreciation are lodged with the chief inspector and is never seen by the officer that the public has made the effort to recognise.
1,14364,3857,14302,My colleagues make my working day pleasurable, besides this there is not much more The only reason I come to work is to pay the bills. I wouldn&#039;t come to work if I won big on the lottery

1,14370,3864,14364,Did you feel like that when you first started the job? If not, what changed?

1,14372,3864,14363,What would you do to improve things?
1,14373,3856,14365,Demotivated officers are the hardest to work with. I believe virtually all the department has felt demotivated at some point of the last 12 months due to misinformation and delays of the reorganisation.
1,14374,3860,14303,It all depends on who the supervisor is.
1,14375,3858,14303,people play the game of PR4s to help themselves look good, they are valueless and just show how the job is all about self promotion to futher peoples carreers!
1,14376,3865,14363,In what format would recognition be most appreciated, force wide, department wide, community etc.  How would you make this happen?
1,14377,3857,14303,You can receive letters of thanks from members of the public, but on the whole people are more likely to send letters of complaint.  Sometimes you would like a thank you from your sgt or insp but they have their own agenda to follow.
1,14378,3856,14302,I would consider leaving the police if i could get a job for 25k a year without shifts and still have job security.
1,14379,3853,14301,Erm...I have issues with this. As part of a caring organisation, they go through the motions of arranging health checks with the OHU for roles such as family liaison. The OHU then go to great lengths to reassure you of the confidentiality of those meetings...only for the topics discussed to be raised in a different forum (although within the OHU) over a competely separate issue. So I personally have no confidence in the OHU to be discreet and secure.<br />We are provided with good sickness provisions such as 7 days self certificated sick leave  and minimum 6 months full pay, yet, clauses are put in place to rush people back to work when not ready to, such as being penalised for career moves due to a poor sickness record or even withdrawal of competancy payments. It would be relatively easy for anyone with limited level of intelligence to spot sickness patterns as opposed to genuine illness or injury. Sickness monitoring is a particularly oppressive practice within Merseyside Police!!
1,14380,3856,14374,Certain departments play the game and &#039;big it up&#039; to make themselves look good. Its a farce.
1,14381,3859,14369,better pay, some officers in the dept are on top cons pay &pound;35k   where officers young in service receive &pound;25k   work loads do not reflect pay scales.
1,14382,3855,14304,At the moment there is no clear direction as to the role of the traffic officer.  Radio control rooms see traffic patrols as just another patrol to be deployed to area incidents.  This often means being called away from what we should be doing, ie, patrolling the motorway resulting in No Patrol Available to do the work that we should be doing, we then have to account for ourselves and why we were unable to attend our own incidents.
1,14383,3858,14304,each supervisor has their own slant on how the job should be done and therefore you never know what is meant to be done and how
1,14384,3859,14303,letters of thanks from senior officers, emails and on one occasion a telephone call whilst on nights from the supt.
1,14385,3857,14304,On a daily basis, are department is requested to assist others, when they have no patrols available, which in turn affects your performance
1,14386,3856,14363,There should be a name and shame list published of every &#039;customer&#039; that is convicted of a serious offence at court. Lets tell the public how good we are instead of always defending officers when the public moan.
1,14387,3855,14300,Work Computer Sytems.  Merseyside police is constantly implementing IT systems that nobody can use, eg, NICHE.  the system was installed almost 2 years ago and still people are unable to use it with any form of efficiencey.  It makes the job longer and harder and keeps patrols off the streets.  Officers such as myself did not have computers at school and the job have never taken the time to train anyone to use them.  This makes life very difficult.
1,14388,3865,14383,When on the job how confident do you feel to make independant decisions?
1,14389,3864,14383,Is your role specified (in a job description, say) even though your supervisors may not stick to it in practice?
1,14390,3859,14303,you only tend to get recognition when you ask for it, PDP4s etc playing the game.
1,14391,3856,14304,My role appears to change/alter on a weekly basis. It all depends on what is topical or political. Its very annoying and disruptive.
1,14392,3860,14304,Just another resource for the radio room
1,14393,3865,14392,Do you feel the traffic officer is seen as a valuable resource to the organisation?
1,14394,3857,14305,My symptoms of stress are usually going home and talking about my day, this helps me unwind and &quot;get it of my chest&quot;
1,14395,3856,14305,Lack of patience, a headache and the constant looking at the clock thinking is it time to go home yet
1,14396,3853,14302,The pay isn&#039;t bad!<br />The pleasureable aspects are not a consequence of anything that the Police do, more the satisfaction gained from doing the job we all joined to do.<br />Most accepted pleasures that were provided by the organisation have long since been removed such as sporting facilities, dining facilities, even the humour and natural fun. Humour/fun, more often than not, has a victim. The victim of that humour can accept themself as being the centre of a joke or prank and take it in the way it is intended. I&#039;ve always viewed it as a form of acceptance to have the Mickey taken out of me. The present climate now means that anyone can be offended on that persons behalf. Trust in your colleagues has, consequently, been eroded and a large part of the enjoyment of the job has gone. There is a climate of fear!
1,14397,3856,14393,Only to get rid of another job off the screen.
1,14398,3865,14394,In general do officers feel free to discuss work incidents with family members?
1,14399,3860,14305,increase in heart rate,
1,14400,3856,14388,Is that discretion?
1,14401,3858,14305,just have a feeling of overwhelming frustration at the situation at work and the futility at playing the game that is called work!
1,14402,3865,14305,How does stress interfere with work, ie sick time, ineffectual decision making, please be specific
1,14403,3857,14394,I have always discussed incidents with my partner,  my partner has a smiliar type of role and understands my stresses.
1,14404,3859,14388,whilst dealing with an incident total confidence. having submitted the paperwork through a supervisor which is endorsed as per your recomendations then to recieve it back from a A/Sgt at the CJU with no traffic experience with recomendations that are incorrect it tends to undermine your ability.
1,14405,3865,14401,What are some examples of futility?
1,14406,3856,14361,The one thing that bugs me is that officers who work in an office on days with the same length of service are getting paid the same as officers working 3 shifts. We have are rest days cancelled etc etc and have to just get on with the disruption it causes and all for no extra pay. Basically work shifts get compensated for it!
1,14407,3859,14305,tend to get headaches lack of motervation want to go home early
1,14408,3855,14305,As i look at the clock and the time to leave home for work approaches, i start to feel wound up and do not  want to go.  I suffer with sleeplessness, headaches and general fatigue &#039;all&#039; the time.  I&#039;m sure the Police need to look long and hard as to how staff are treated as in the recent past &#039;TWO&#039; police officers have committed suicide, both due to work issues ???????
1,14409,3855,14300,i beleive I joined the merseyside police to make it a safer place to live and provide a service to the public.  It would appear I was wrong, I feel I am acctually here to score brownie point by providing performance indicators to make the Cheif Inspector look good so that he can be promoted.  The police have totally lost sight of caring for the public that need us due to their own self interest.
1,14410,3859,14402,you are unable to take time off with stress due to fear of a sickness record or being labeled and not suitabe for a pasting
1,14411,3856,14306,Going home in a bad mood. Trying to catch myself and stop myself from moaning or lashing out (being snappy) to friends or family. Also being quiet and not interacting with them as my mind is elsewhere.
1,14412,3857,14306,argumentative
1,14413,3858,14306,lack of tollerance and bad temper.
1,14414,3860,14306,shout at the kids, being off hand with my partner. Drinking heavily at night
1,14415,3859,14306,moody, short temper, unwilling to join in with activities, snap with little provication. tired
1,14416,3858,14307,I just tend to be quieter and less tolerant
1,14417,3853,14303,Credit/thanks is rare. That&#039;s fine, we&#039;re well paid. However, the performance monitoring system revolves around proof of good performance. I know I&#039;m good at what I do but how do I prove to others that I am? I am relying on my good work being recognised and documented to prove my competance. If that competance is just accepted as the norm and not recognized then I am at a disadvantage. More emphasis should be placed on recognizing and rewarding good performance and not be as inconsistant and sporadic as it is now.
1,14418,3856,14307,Tell them to &#039;stick it&#039; or shut up if necessary. It tends to be frustration at the task in hand not my colleagues that stresses me out.
1,14419,3857,14308,I find going to the gym can help me to relieve my stresses.  It makes me feel good.<br />I have recently seen the idea of having an afternoon nap helps productiity I would love to have an afternoon nap and then carry on working I know this help me to cope better.
1,14420,3860,14307,can not be bothered assisting them with anything become lazy
1,14421,3859,14307,tend to snap at comments made in fun. exclude myself from conversations dont mix with group work by myself.
1,14422,3858,14308,OHU and I have used them as a defence against the jobs threats against me due to reduced productivity because of the stress I&#039;m suffering...........you have to break the cycle!!
1,14423,3853,14304,Too vague a question. Sorry.
1,14424,3860,14308,There&#039;s nothing, only going sick
1,14425,3857,14308,I have received counselling in the past which did help me. Waiting for an appointment on the NHS can take a long time but I received counselling from the job in just 4 weeks.  my counselling was not job related but because I was off work for 3 weeks I they offered me counselling.
1,14426,3856,14308,If i was in the matrix or armed response departments i could go the gym during works time that would help... However as a resource that is in short supply and high demand that isn&#039;t possible
1,14427,3853,14305,Restless, loss of concentration, loss of confidence. Loss of appetite. I can only focus on the issue causing the stress and cannot settle until it is resolved. Performance in other matters consequently suffers.
1,14428,3857,14309,I was happy to use the counselling services.  I was of benefit to me
1,14429,3853,14306,Quiet and withdrawn. Irritable.
1,14430,3855,14306,My fiancee is the superintendent in the department.  Arguements and heated discussions have taken place between us due to the actions of the cheif inspector and some of the inspectors that work for him.  Shakeshaft frequently bullies and intimidates the staff, when I have told him of this he has disagreed with me causing friction between us.  On numerous occasions now he has subsequently asked other members of staff to verify the facts and I have now lost count of how many times the CI has been proved to be a Liar, a liability and a bully.<br />I have also suffered from discrimination from 2 inspectors in the department as neither of whom wish to have the bosses girlfriend working for them (spy in the camp) as I am sure they fear I will tell him what goes on that they do not inform him of.  I feel victimised and passed over for opportunities that I am clearly capable of because of my relationship.  This is a direct breach of equal opportunities.
1,14431,3856,14308,I&#039;m not aware of any other resources other than going to the Occupational Support Unit. I&#039;m not likely to do that either as I don&#039;t want or need to go onto restricted duties.
1,14432,3860,14310,bringing up teenagers,
1,14433,3856,14309,As per last answer...what resources?
1,14434,3858,14309,Yes it is my defence against the bosses threats of a move out of the department because I&#039;m not doing enough figures........they dont care to find out why my work rate has dropped and what may have caused it......they just use threats as a management tool. they just bully the staff.
1,14435,3859,14308,the only resorces are occupational health i think, would i use them, no too much trouble easier to go home and relax with the family. if they were more accesable maybe. there are fewer gyms in the police stations and you can only use them in your own time which is valuable, you then have demans held to you that you must be fit and health and be able to pass fitness tests. the tv rooms are small and can only take 6 officers you have to
1,14436,3853,14307,I don&#039;t generally. However, I routinely have  a problem with some people anyway. Those people are best not to upset me at difficult times.
1,14437,3857,14310,I am a  mother of a 1 year old son.  My issues are, I  work days at the moment. my husband works shifts,  When my son reaches 6 years old I will have to go back on shifts.   TELL ME WHO LOOKS AFTER THE BABY WHEN WE ARE BOTH ON AFTERNOONS? the work life balance should continue until children are 11 years old not 6 years old.
1,14438,3859,14309,it is a lot easier to just go home you spend enough time in work. However if you were given time in the working day to use resources then yes. i can not see this happening.
1,14439,3860,14311,working nights, different meal times to rest of family. Trying to organise social life when you do not know what your doing from month to month
1,14440,3858,14310,Problems with my children......... they are ongoing but you inform one boss and then they move and the new boss has no knowledge of your problems and you have to raise the painful issues again once the threats start again!!
1,14441,3856,14310,Working shifts can be convenient but also very inconvenient. My partner does not work for the police and does not work shifts. I also have friends who do not work shifts so having a social life can be difficult. It can be a real pain having to take annual leave just to goto a party or wedding etc
1,14442,3855,14307,I know I go into work feeling low almost all of the time,  i am furtunate to work with some good officers and we support each other.  We try to laugh each day and work together as a team as we are all fully aware that there will be no support from anywhere else.
1,14443,3853,14308,The only resource I am aware of is the OHU. As my earlier answer already states, due to personal experience, I have no faith in them so, as I am aware, there is nothing provided with the organisation to cater for any difficulties in relation to stress...help  must be sought elsewhere.
1,14444,3859,14310,very little exept when you selfish and want to spend more time with loved ones rether than be miserable at work wishing you were back home with family
1,14445,3858,14311,the shifts,the extended duties at short notice, the inability to get time off when there are important family occasions. the tireness from working the shifts.
1,14446,3853,14309,No I&#039;m not comfortable with the OHU. I doubt their promises and assurances of confidentiality. I have attended the OHU for a ( compulsory, role required) health check and confidences were betrayed. I&#039;m sorry but the OHU is no longer even a considered option for me.
1,14447,3857,14310,When my child is sick I can take leave which is unpaid,  I think parents should receive at least 2 weeks pay, per year for parental leave.  You could use all your annaul leave for sick days.
1,14448,3856,14310,My partner being off at the weekend when the weathers good and I&#039;m already demotivated at work effects me. I would never go sick to spend time at home or with my family but i can&#039;t say i havn&#039;t contemplated it.
1,14449,3859,14311,working shifts, very little time spent with family on conventional days off eg weekends etc. nights, the following day spent sleeping. benig constantly told to stay on duty for an extra few hours due to poor planning.
1,14450,3857,14310,I need to get of on time each time, but  you carn&#039;t always do that in this job. Thats why policewomen look for day jobs.
1,14451,3855,14301,There needs to be less preasure of traffic officers.  The job fails to see that we are the only people in the force who on a very regular basis are confronted with violent deaths of both adults and children.  Each road death attended, it is likely the victim has been smashed apart.  We deal with the scene, on occasions help with body recovery, have the responsibility for the investigation and deal with the families.  We will then attend the post mortems and at no stage does our employes consider our feelings.  No other officers in the force are confronted by what we do. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,14452,3856,14311,Again the shifts can get in the way. I have chosen not to take on certain roles within the department because i will not let the job effect my private/personal life anymore than it does. I am not considering going for promotion as it requires me to devote an unexceptional amount of time to study and prepare at home. Although i believe that i could cope with the role of a supervisor i don&#039;t think the pay reflects the responsibilty
1,14453,3853,14311,I want to be able to spend quality time with my family. Whilst I am fully appreciative of the demand profile of my job, it concerns me that, due to a lack of resources, I can not take time off at peak times such as school holidays. My children have only ever known me to work during their holidays and whilst they enjoy the benefits that Dad&#039;s job brings them, they would like to see him more often during their leisure time. The prospects of time off during school summer holdidays is a mere lottery and there is no structure in place to help those with school age children. The summer holdiday leave period runs from June to September and the Police will guarantee us 16 days uninterupted holiday during that period. Great but, family people with school age children, rely on a six week window from mid July to September. It is hard to tell your children that Dad can&#039;t come on holiday this year!
1,14454,3855,14300,Going into work on any given day to find that you are the one and only patrol out covering from Southport to Warrington.  Health and safety clearly states that the motorway patrol should be a double crewed vehicle, this is often ignored.  As the lone patrol with the responibility for all incidents that may take place you often find yourself alone on the motorway taking risks to yourself in order to make the place safer for the public.
1,14455,3857,14311,At the moment the job supports my issues with the work/life balance policy.  However this ends when my child reaches 6 years old.  Family life would be quite difficult if woking shifts, weekends nights etc.  I know this is a requirment of the job but this job is a male dominated role not female. Females are usually the main career and the ones usually taking time off.
1,14456,3853,14310,None.
1,14457,3855,14300,The constant preasure for performance indicators.  Eg, An officer can give out 5 speeding tickets in an hour with the use of a laser and take the rest of the day off and therefore if the &#039;Golden Child&#039;.  An officer can spend 5 days investigating a fail to stop RTC in which 3 people could have been killed and is deamed to have done nothing!!!!! because dealing with an rtc is not a performance indicator.  Can someone please tell me why i am here???
1,14458,3853,14300,Expectation. Having served 22 years, 17 of which within the traffic department, I now find the level of responsibility is above that which used to be expected of me. That is fine, I actually enjoy the stress that this brings as a certain degree is needed to do my job. However, the injustice that I am not financially rewarded as I should be, ie people in other departments, with my level of responsibility, are usually at least two maybe even three ranks up on me and are therefore both more experienced and better trained than I am, can demand more due to their rank, can get away with more, again, due to their rank (old boy&#039;s network) and receive the financial benefits of a higher rank.
1,14459,3855,14308,The OHU have a stress manager.  It would not matter how desperate I was, I would never use the services of the OHU.  I have been seriously injured on duty in the past and hospitalised and was unable to obtain any form of help or assistance from the OHU when injured, I would most certainly NEVER EVER trust them with any issues, especially stress.
1,14460,3855,14309,Although the ohu state that information provided to them is confidential, it clearly is NOT.  The organisation will discuss your medical issues openly breaching medical confidentiality, with the organisation.  They are clearly not to be trusted.
1,14461,3855,14310,None of my personal or family issues affect how i do my job.
1,14462,3855,14311,My home life is interferred with greatly because of the job, due to the stress placed on people and feeling low all the time, both myself and partner are constantly looking at ways to cheer each other up and try to leave the job behind.  Problems arise between us when we start to discuss work.  I feel greatly for him as it is clear that the Cheif Inspector and a couple of the inspectors that work for him regularly and deliberately misslead him with mis-information.  He should be in a position where he can trust these people and due to them having there own &#039;agenda&#039; he is unable to do so.
2,14463,3874,0,What are your recommendations for improvement?
1,14464,3859,14304,lack of direction.
1,14465,3855,14300,Night shifts.  Working Solo on nights and lack of sleep can have an adverse effect on health.  It is very difficult to function to any degree when working alone on nights, when double crew it is easier to stay motivated.  When performance is low on nights the Chief Inspector wants to know why?
1,14466,3885,14463,testing
1,14467,3881,14463,1. leadership that actually know what job we really do.<br />2. allow the staff to be self driven rather than treated as children and told what to do in every minute of the working day.<br />3. stand up to the rest of the force and say no occasionally instead of dumping more work on the department.<br />4. stand up to the control rooms about our deployment guide.<br />5. have decent office space and equipment to do the job with.
1,14468,3884,14463,In what ways would you involve superiors in the day to day workings and duties of an officer?
1,14469,3879,14463,Regarding the restructure/reorganisation of the department :-<br />too much gossip and hearsay was passed to the staff by bosses. This resulted in misinformation and rumours. At the early stages discussions should have remianed confidential and information passed to the staff when ALL the bosse were in agreement in direction or course of action.
1,14470,3885,14467,Who do you want to implement these improvements? (i.e., WHO should stand up to rest of the force/control rooms?)
1,14471,3881,14463,no superiors............just higher rank!!!
1,14472,3884,14463,What does an &quot;good&quot; working day look like to you?
1,14473,3881,14463,annual leave!
1,14474,3879,14472,An early finish or working a rest day for double time !
1,14475,3881,14470,our bosses..........not leave it to us over the radio!
1,14476,3879,14471,We have no superiors just people who bothered to take the exam!
1,14477,3885,14472,Would you like to see any stress reducing resources/facilities available other than OHU? Please specify. How would you ensure people actually used them?
1,14478,3880,14463,1. realistic goals and objectives with rewards for achieving them.<br />2. strong leadership not people who think they are strong leaders.<br />3. better work environment not litte broom cupboard at the end of corridor. areas to relax away from stress of work. the use of a gym in work time to help relax.<br />4. equiptment to do the work, more computers and paper for printers, vehicles fixed in an exeptable period of time not two weeks to get a new ignition key. more and better equipt vehicles for role.  Water for the cooler would be nice.<br />5. more officers.<br />6. SPP for all operational officers<br />7. flexability in work areas rather than constant demans for prosecution of motorists.<br />8. time to unwind after a shift. rather than finish get in your car and go home with all the days worries.<br />9. better pay as it clearly does not reflect the levels of stress we are placed under.<br />10. more work and colleage related activities to promote team building. at present it is every person for themselves.<br />11. a real no blame culture.<br />12.
1,14479,3879,14463,Realistic and worthwhile goals instaed of ridiculous performance indicators where an arrest that takes you several hours to deal with a disqualified driver or a drink driving offence is counted the same as a &pound;30 fixed penalty for No Seatbelt !!!!
1,14480,3878,14463,Provide Cheif Inspector Shakeshaft with an Exit Stratergy from the department.  As he has threatened others with in the past.<br />Employ a boss who actually knows and understands what we do and the preasures placed upon us dealing with death all the time.<br />The staff in the traffic department are amongst the most professional in the force, they do not need to be treated like children and bullied on a daily basis, it is insulting to think that as adults dealing with the incidents that we deal with, bosses can not leave us alone to get on with it and do it well without being made to feel inadequate because we didn&#039;t issue a ticket on any particular day.
1,14481,3880,14468,as little as possible to encorage the easy flow for the day
1,14482,3880,14472,one that finishes with an early dart, recognition for a hard days work.
1,14483,3878,14463,Reduce fear of being off sick.  It has been a regular occurance where people come into work ill with flu viruses etc and thus pass this on to colleagues.  In no time at all the entire office are ill and struggling into work as they feel if they do not, they will be victimised.
1,14484,3885,14478,Any particular suggestions for ways you would you like to unwind before driving home? (e.g., with colleagues, social clubs/bars for police etc.?)
1,14485,3877,14467,1. It is easy to get someone (or even do it for yourself) to look up statistics and figures, then interpret them in a way that makes sense to you, yet often, you may not fully understand the facts behind those figures. I would take the time to fully understand the issues that really matter and take advice from the people who really know, whoever they may be.<br />2. Targets are often set which limit people&#039;s abilities. I would allow them a reasonable level of initiative. If found to be successful, let them carry on. If they&#039;re not successful then consider the necessary remedial action.<br />3. This would take a person secure in their role. &#039;Sycophantasia&#039; should be a criminal offence. However, it seems to be recognised that to get on you just do as you&#039;re told. I would encourage freedom of speech and objective disagreement.<br />4. Simple. Prioritise our work level and accept the responsibility that comes with that priority. Just say no.<br />5. People will work better, harder and safer if they are provided with the right environment and the right tools to do the job. Speculate on a good working environment and you may accumulate a happier and more stable workforce.
1,14486,3886,14463,shorter working week for same pay (36 hrs)<br />flexible working hours.<br />better pay and working environment<br />time at the end of shift to go to the gym<br />ssp for officers working shifts  (not office jobs)<br />study time<br />less emphasis on performance indicators<br />paid parental leave.<br />creche

Mr jones said it is only a piece of grass at which point he says that me zaham threatened to kill him. the next day he found a hole in the fence. Mr Jones belives he is involved in extremist activity and says often 12 young men in their twenties come to the house carrying packages. Mr zaham has accussed mr jones of being a racist and told him that he would regret starting the iraq war.

If i want to call her with any questions I think the ph no is 0151-7062124.<br />I would need to know when the first person diagnosed with these symptoms was admitted to the hospital and who that person was. Also find out the activities of that person prior to infection in hopes of finding out when and how they became infected. I would also need to know if the patients had anything in common that may halep attribute cause of the illness, again in hoped of locating the source. I will also need to know the results once Kate/Kerry gets them to get a better idea of what I&#039;m dealing with. Find out if there is any difference between the people who have died from the illness and those who are still alive. Also need to know about possible symptoms that are unique to the illness in hopes of being able to diagnose it more quickly.

1,14612,3911,14557,1.2 Not exceptionally confident. I didn&#039;t get much sleep last night so my short term memory if not the best at the moment. Somewhere between 60% and 70%
1,14613,3911,14558,1.3 none

1,14616,3909,14556,2.4 Bacterial sample found in all samples.  Two swab tests taken from all patients.  Bacteria unable to be identified due to unsuffient blood samples or only small amounts of bacteria.<br />Need mpre tests performed on sample to show what the bacteria is and draw possible conclusions as to what caused it?
1,14617,3906,14556,6.2<br />- Blood results returned inconclusive from the 8 autopsies.<br />- Reason: blood samples were too small to recognize any conclusive bacteriological indicators, despite some small bio-cultures being discovered in the samples.<br />- Order larger blood samples, in order to validate any tests.<br />- Any patients with similar symptoms should be fast-tracked for analysis.
1,14618,3906,14557,6.2<br />- 85%
1,14619,3909,14557,2.4 I am 70% confident that I understood

1,14621,3907,14556,report from Royal Hospital of Liverpool:<br />Bacterial analysis have been done on 8 patients (5women, 3men), presenting the following symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, diarhea, dehydratation, etc.<br />The conclusions of the tests haven&#039;t given results because the blood sample were insufficient. Others patients will be tested soon.
1,14622,3908,14556,2.2 some kind of bacterie is in their blond... probable some epdemi is going on... i need to know which bacterie is this, how dangerous can be... what can be usefull against this bacterie and where this people get this bacterie.
1,14623,3905,14556,7.2 - Now know that a bacterial organism was found in all 16 blood samples taken from the 8 fatalities. However due to the insufficient amount of blood taken it could not be conclusively established what type of organism it was. We also know that the fatalities comprised of 5females and 3males, however we still don&#039;t know their age and other demographics or if there is any connection between them all. Samples taken from current patients has been fast-tracked for analysis.  Need to know if a bacterial organism is found in the samples of current patients, also need to ensure the samples are large enough so that the organisms type can be determined.

1,14625,3910,14556,turn 2 2.1<br />I know the result of test showed all patients have some problem with bacteria in abdomen. but because of small blood sample more test would be necessary<br />I am not sure that nurse is asking for investigation on that problem of bacteria tested in patients.

1,14627,3900,14556,12.2 Microbiology results faxed to SIO. 16 blood samples were tested, 2 from each of the 8 fatalities. Bacterial organisms were found  in all 16 samples but the type cannot be determined due to insufficient sample size. Each culture must be 10mg. Patients continue to present with the same symptoms as the deceased. Sufficient cultures must be taken to ensure the bacterial organism can be identified. Swabs must be taken from these patients and examined and tested asap.
1,14628,3907,14557,55%  5
1,14629,3905,14557,70% confident, the blood results although identifying a bacterial organism, were inconclusive &amp; didnt help further the investigation.
1,14630,3909,14596,above questions should have been labeled 1.4-sorry<br />2.4 possible suspects, again water supply or some kind of virus that is being passed around either airborne or other
1,14631,3900,14557,12.2 70 % confident
1,14632,3903,14556,9.2 on 11/03/06 report came back on blood samples.<br />Pacients were all presenting with the same symptoms - stomach pains, vomitting, dehydration, dierrhera, low blood pressure.<br />8 people provided blood for 2 cultures (5 female and 3 male). These 16 came back inconclusive as not enough blood was taken.<br />A bacterial organism was found - however do not know nature or how it came to be in host.<br />Need 10ml of blood for each culture.<br />Blood needs to be taken again so that a better analysis can be performed.<br />Recommendation that each new patient presenting with same symptoms should have swabs taken.<br />Need to know more about organism - what it is and how it is contracted.
1,14633,3913,14556,14.2 Some form of biological food/ water poisoning is taking place on a large scale. Due to the significantly high amount of new patients I am almost certain this is being caused deliberately. All the samples revealed the presence of unidentifiable bacteria. It is imperative to find out what strain of bacteria is involved and whether it has been administered via food or water.
1,14634,3904,14556,8.2 Results from the blood test have  shown that of the 16 people tested, they were gram-inconlcusive for a bacterial organism.<br />It is necessary to obtain 10mls of blood for each sample, therefore more needed.<br />What is thought to be a suspected source of the outbreak is a bacterial organism contamination into the water supply.<br />Need to confirm whether this bacterial source is in fact the culprit before we can investigate any other avenues and question who has access.
1,14635,3901,14556,11.2  It has been determined after the lab carried out analyses of blood samples given by 16 individuals all with similar symptoms of abdominal pain, dehydration, diarrhea, etc., that conclusive results were not possible as the blood samples were not large enough.  Bacteria was present in the samples but due to the small sample sizes no further information was available.  The recommendation was to gather larger blood sample amounts from patients exhibiting these symptoms to test further as well as swab new cases coming in immediately to test as fast as possible.  It still needs to be determined the cause of the outbreak in these symptoms (ex. the bacteria causing it as well as the source of the problem).
1,14636,3905,14558,7.2 - still believe any of the suspects mentioned in 7.1 could be to blame. Currently I am keeping an open mind until further evidence is uncovered.

1,14646,3901,14558,11.2  No new suspects have been determined in light of this new information.
1,14647,3903,14557,9.2 Still do not know the extent of the problem - concern that organism could spread within the hospital - were all people with symptoms presenting when they first came in?<br />Did syptoms start after coming to the hospital?<br />Could be contagoues - need to isolate patients and monitor staff to see if they become unwell.<br />Need to know whether this is an accicdental act or something that has been induced. Possible terroist act?
1,14648,3913,14557,14.2 Without knowing the type of bacteria and the source I am still not very confident that I have an accurate understanding of the incident. I am aware of a large scale food poisoning outbreak, however until I know the type/source of bacteria I am know more than 25% confident.
1,14649,3904,14558,8.2.3. Still no clear suspects though it is thought to have generated from a water source.

1,14652,3911,14556,1. Turn 2.1The microbilogist&#039;s report is inconclusive. It was issued on the 9th of March by the Senior Nurse Kate/Kerry. It was marked urgent. They clinician&#039;s report marked the symptoms as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dehydration etc. There were 8 participants in the test (5 F, 3 M). Each patient had 2 blood tests taken. (Total 16 samples). The gram-inclusive (might not be right term) came back negative after 48 hours of incubation. A Bacterial organism was found in 16 out of 16 samples however the blood samples were not sufficiently large to identfy it. The Microbiologist&#039;s (Prof. Reece Something) has suggested that 10ml samples be taken in the next test to try to ensure that the bacterial organism can be indentified.<br />The patient&#039;s intials were given but i can&#039;t remember all of them. (J.K, and D.K were 2 of them I think). There were 3 or 4 research assistant&#039;s working with the head microbiologist.<br />I still need to know the answers to the questions from turn 1.
1,14653,3913,14558,For such a large scale case of biological poisoning I am open to the possibility that it is being carried out by terrorists (50% confident). There is also the possibility that someone may have polluted a local reservoir out of maliciousness- however I am less confident about this possibility (10%)
1,14654,3902,14558,10.2  someone who working place water care-they could poisoned by water it could happened by accidently. 50%<br />or someone who working in restrant- they might buy  or order food same place-70%

1,14657,3909,14556,3.4 I know that there has been an incident where a gun has bene fired into a fence leaving a hole.  There is either a dispute over a fence and a plot of grass or the dispute is over the noise level coming from one particular house.  Neiterh stories or statements match up.  The only common point is that a gun shot was heard and a hole fromthe gun is in the fence.

I need to know what relationship between two events
1,14663,3912,14556,13.3 I think that Mr. Zaman is first suspect for this incident. This is because he has many troubles with his neighbor. And also, I need to know other witness information. At this moment, it is too early to decide who is the suspect.

1,14667,3913,14556,14.3 There are two contradicting statements between 2 neighbours regarding the shooting of their dividing fence. Without any bias I think there is definitely more credibility from the man in house number 17. I think his statement gives strength to my earlier convictions that terrorist extremists may be behind this large scale outbreak of poisoning. Need to know the reasons why Mr Zamon has visited Pakistan. Need to know who these groups are visiting his house late at night each week.

1,14673,3901,14556,11.3  In early march there was a disturbance between neighbours which resulted in a bullet hole through the fence that divides their two properties.  Those involved, Mr. Jones and Mr. Zaman, have conflicting stories as to how the bullet hole came to be, in which Mr. Jones states that it was Mr. Zaman which fired the gun after an argument regarding land division and property rights and Mr. Zaman threatening to kill Mr. Jones.  Mr. Jones also feels as though Mr. Zaman could be a member of a terrorist organization and is known around the neighbourhood to be highly political.  Conversely, Mr. Zaman says that it was Mr.  Jones who cause the bullet hole after politely asking Mr. Jones to be a little more quiet because he was trying to sleep after a long flight back from Pakistan, resulting in Mr. Jones threatening to kill Mr. Zaman.<br />What is also known is that the outbreak at the hospital has escalated, resulting in 72 deaths and nearly 2000 patients.  There is still no information as to what is causing this outbreak.<br />Whether these two incidences (between neighbours) and the outbreak are related is unknown at this point in time.
1,14674,3903,14557,9.3 20% have a better understanding of the illness and that it is an urgent matter. Have more information but still need more.<br />Need to find out how the illness is contracted.
1,14675,3907,14556,report from Hospital : 72 fatalities which is really abnormal, still no results from bacteriological analysis.<br />Report from the police about a shooting incident involving two neighbours which give a declaration in total contradiction.<br />One statement is about an aggressive and violent noisy neighbour who refused to be quiet during his neighbour tried to have a rest. He seems to be a racist.<br />The second statement is about the fact they had an argument about the place of a fence in the property of each other. A gunshot has been heard after the argument and there was a hole in the fence. That neighbour seems to receive young people (20y.o) weekly in his house, bringing big packets, and has had problems in the neighbourhood. The neighboor suspect him to be a terrorist.<br />A map about the different location where people started to be sick has been givem.

1,14679,3905,14556,7.3 - Know that there was an altercation on 5th March between Keith Jones &amp; his neighbour Shehad Zaman.  On 6th March, Mr Jones claims that this incident occurred around 2pm when Mr Zaman was sitting outside on his front lawn.  Mr Jones claims that Mr Zaman was getting angry about the position of the fence separating the 2 gardens &amp; believed that Mr Jones had some of his &#039;land&#039;. Mr Jones claims that Mr Zaman threatened to shoot him, called him a racist &amp; when he went into the house he heard a gun shot.  Later on he saw a hole in the fence &amp; assumed that Mr Zaman had done it.  Mr Jones has also seen lots of big packages going into Mr Zaman&#039;s house &amp; suspects that he part of some sort of terrorist movement.<br />3 days later, on the 9th March Mr Zaman issues his own statement of the events. He claims that he was not on his front lawn but was actually trying to sleep due to suffering from jet-lag after recently returning from pakistan. He also claims this altercation occurred around 1pm, not 2pm. He says Mr Jones was making noise so he went round to ask him to keep it down &amp; claims Mr Jones threatened to shoot him. He returned to his house &amp; later heard a gunshot which he assumed was from Mr Jones. He later found a hole in the fence.<br />Clearly, one of the 2 is lying. But without outside witness statements it is currently unclear who that person might be.<br />This incident &amp; subsequent reporting occurred at the same time as the issue was raised about the number of patients at a&amp;e rising.  There have now been over 2000 patients attending a&amp;e with the same symptoms &amp; there have been 72 fatalities.  Blood tests are still pending.  Obviously the initial worry of a deliberate epidemic has been confirmed, yet it is still unknown what has caused it.
1,14680,3913,14557,14.3 My confidence has grown significantly through reading this peice of information. As the numbers of fatalities continue to escalate it looks more and more likely that terrrorists are behind this attack. With the highest numbers of fatalities occurring in and around the city centre this also fuels the likliehood of terrorism being involved as these are the most densely populated areas of the city. So now I would be around 40% confident that I have an accurate understanding of the incident.
1,14681,3910,14556,turn 3<br />2.1 I think i don&#039;t need to relate two events
1,14682,3902,14556,10.3 Mr Jones migh involve that crime. he was not happy his property he had argument about that before and behaved suspiously. need to interview him. he might commit that for revenge. he might try to posion neighbour&#039;s garden. but somehow accidently or intentionaly it posioned water so other peple got posioned too.
1,14683,3912,14558,13.3 Mr. Zaman (around 50%) &amp; other suspects. possibly, they are biorogical terorists. &amp; maybe Mr. Zaman is the leader of this terorit group.
1,14684,3902,14557,10.3. 30
1,14685,3901,14557,11.3  I am not very confident in the accuracy of the incident between Mr. Jones and Mr. Zaman as their stories are highly conflicting.  No conclusive evidence as to which party is telling the true story has been revealed (50%).<br />I am also not very confident in understanding whether the incident between Jones and Zaman are related to the outbreak at the Liverpool Hospital (25%).
1,14686,3904,14559,8.3.1 One witness report indicates that there is some suspicion with a man named Shezhad  Zaman. His neighbour reports that he has experienced many problems with this man and suspects terrorist activity based on late night meeting with other people of his ethnicity. He describes how he has witnessed ipto 12 individuals enter Shehzad&#039;s property carrying large packages and suspects that this is a regular meeting  as part of an extreminst organisation. Mr Zaman&#039;s neighbour states that he has recieved death threats and accusations of being racist to the effect that he &#039;will be sorry you supported the war in Iraq&#039;. He also describes how he heard  a gunshot when inside his house and the next morning he found a bullet hole in the fence. The two neighbours have engaged in a heated dispute over right of land  space with Mr Zaman stating that his neighbour&#039;s land encroached on his property, following which the death threats etc occurred.<br />Also a polce incident report shows that Mr Zaman filed a complaint about this neighbour describiong an incident contrasting the earlier witness statement, implying that in fact it was his neighbour who was causiung a lot of noise and then made death threats and shot at the fence.<br />Update from infection control nurse at the hospital stated that the casualties have risen to over 2000 and 72 fatalities highlighting the scale of the crisis.
1,14687,3905,14557,7.3 - It is now possible that this is a terrorist attack on the local community &amp; it cannot be ignored how vast the numbers are increasing.  Someone is deliberately poisoning the liverpudlian community.  No known threats to the area have been publicly made by terrorist organisations yet so this is currently only speculation.
1,14688,3905,14558,7.3 - Terrorist group - 90%
1,14689,3904,14557,8.3.2 85% understanding of the incident. There are now a few suspects on which to concentrate our efforts.
1,14690,3903,14558,9.3 The community aspect is still an option - water/food/air.<br />What shipments have come in from the docks from abroad?<br />Still need to find out if it originated in the hospital - could be spreading when patients of visitors leave.<br />Could be Mr.Z or Mr Jones - need more information about there relationship and their characters.<br />Need to know the background on these individuals and movements.<br />Also need to look at other possible terroist organisations in the area - who has recently given religious talks or been precehing.<br />If Mr Z.&#039;s associates are in there 20&#039;s need to look at the student population - has there been any terroist issues? Groups that pose a problem within the Liverpool area or the Universities.<br />Still need to know more about the illness and how it is contracted - research types of biological weapons - do any of the symptoms match?
1,14691,3913,14558,14.3 Mr Zamon is highly likely to be involved (perhaps even orchestrating the attack) in the current outbreak (55% certain on this). At this stage he is the only main suspect brought to my attention.
1,14692,3904,14558,At the moment there are two possoble suspects. Firstly Shehzad Zaman and his neighbour.
1,14693,3901,14558,11.3  Suspects now include Mr. Jones (20%) and Mr. Zaman (40%) in the investigation of this outbreak along with restuarants (10%) in the area and the government bodies in charge of water and water regulations (50%).
1,14694,3900,14556,12.3 Update from the Senior Infection nurse at the hospital. There now have been 72 fatalities in total and over 1000 patients presenting with sympotms. No further microbiology reports are available at present. The situation is clearly escalating and is a serious public health problem.    Police reports recevied. Mr Zaman claims while suffering jet lag and trying to sleep after recently returning from a trip to Pakistan, his neighbour Mr Jones was making a lot of noise. Mr Zaman states than when he asked Mr Jones politely to be quieter, Mr Jones became aggressive and was threatening to shoot him. Mr Zaman retreated indoors in fear for the safety of himself and his family. He later heard a loud noise outside. The next morning a hole was evident in the fence separating the neighbours&#039; properties which looked like a gunshot. Mr Zaman is frightened to leave the house.  Mr Jones provided a alternative statement regarding this incident. He claims that in the morning he seen Mr Zaman and said &#039;Hello&#039;. Mr Zaman did not return his greeting. Later in the day as he was heading to work, he seen Mr Zaman in the garden who called him over to speak. Mr Zaman claims that some of the land on Mr Jones&#039; side of the fence is actually his property and wants the location of the fence moved back to allow for this. Mr Jones claims to have checked the borders of his property and the fence is in the correct place. On telling Mr Zaman this, Mr Zaman became angry and claimed that they would not be having an argument if he was white - that an apology would be offered by his neighbour and the fence relocated. Mr Zaman then claims that Mr Jones will be sorry for supporting the war in Iraq. Mr Jones claims that Mr Zaman has groups of men in their 20&#039;s visiting him at unsociable hours bringing suspicious looking packages.

1,14696,3904,14556,8.3.1 One witness report indicates that there is some suspicion with a man named Shezhad Zaman. His neighbour reports that he has experienced many problems with this man and suspects terrorist activity based on late night meeting with other people of his ethnicity. He describes how he has witnessed ipto 12 individuals enter Shehzad&#039;s property carrying large packages and suspects that this is a regular meeting as part of an extreminst organisation. Mr Zaman&#039;s neighbour states that he has recieved death threats and accusations of being racist to the effect that he &#039;will be sorry you supported the war in Iraq&#039;. He also describes how he heard a gunshot when inside his house and the next morning he found a bullet hole in the fence. The two neighbours have engaged in a heated dispute over right of land space with Mr Zaman stating that his neighbour&#039;s land encroached on his property, following which the death threats etc occurred.<br />Also a polce incident report shows that Mr Zaman filed a complaint about this neighbour describiong an incident contrasting the earlier witness statement, implying that in fact it was his neighbour who was causiung a lot of noise and then made death threats and shot at the fence.<br />Update from infection control nurse at the hospital stated that the casualties have risen to over 2000 and 72 fatalities highlighting the scale of the crisis.

The map presented to us showed that all the hospitals in the Merseyside area seem to have casualities and most have had fatalities.<br />I was shown two witness statements. One as taken from<br />Keith Jones who lives at 17 Golstam Drive, is over the age of 18 and is a factory worker. Keith&#039;s statement was made on teh 6th of March. The other guy lived at 15 Golstam Drive and his name was a little harder to remember but it began with and S. His statement was taken at 9:30 Keith said that S. came home recently and got in argument with Keith over where the dividing fence was between their houses. Keith said he told S that he had checked with the relevant panning authorities about the position<br />of the fence and that it was in the correct place. According to Keith this made S. very angry and S said that if he was a white person it would be different and that Keith woul regret the war in Iraq. Keith also said that later that night he heard what sounded like a gunshot and that the next day there was a hole in the fence b/w their houses. Keith mentioned that his neighbour S. often had people over, usually after midnight. He also said that the people going to S.&#039;s house were in their 20&#039;s and usually carried large boxes. He also said that they tended to make a lot noise. According to Keith S. is also a political activist and is often involved in protests.<br />S. reported that after having returned from a trip to Pakistan he was quite tired with jet-lag and Keith was making a lot of noise. S said that he called to the house to request that Keith keep the noise down. According to S. Keith then threatened to get a gun and kill S. S. said he then went back to his house because he was afraid. He said that later that night he heard what sound like a gunshot. The next day he saw that there was a hole in the fence.<br />What i need to know is if any of the neighbours of these two men saw anything on the night in question in hopes of verifying one of the two men&#039;s statments. I would also need to find out what type of gun is most likely to have made the hole in the fence and if either of the two men have guns. I would also need to verify that S. is indeed a policical activist and that he did usuallty have large groups of people over late at night who carried large boxes.

Mr Hussein has declared in the mosque of Liverpool that he was going to spread poison in the water around Liverpool and made racists comments.<br />Autopsies report are commenting new death from people presenting usual symptoms (nausea, abdominal pain, etc) they died of internal organ failures which lead to the fact of a poisoning incident.

His friend testified to his good character adding that hes currently taking on extra hours at the factory where he works in order to pay his mortgage.<br />Mr Zaman has a long history of criminal offences, usually public disorder, resisting arrest &amp; public demonstrations.<br />Mr Hussain has been identified as giving extremist speeches in the local mosque, talking about spreading poison through the city. He also has a criminal record for the creation of a chemical weapon. It is possible that he is recruiting people to make his speeches reality.<br />Ballistics from the bullet hole in the fence have determined that it was shot at close range from a common rifle. We need to know if either Mr Jones or Mr Zaman possess such a gun. Also, ballistics/forensics has not identified which side of the fence the bullet was shot from...this would greatly lend weight to one or the other of the neighbours.

He died on 7th March.<br />Need to find out clearer dates when this occurred or started off, were there any major incentive speeches which could have acted as a catalyst for the attack i.e. when was Mohammed Hussein released from prison? This will allow us to establish opportunity for the suspects.<br />Think it is less likely that Mr Jones is guilty, more evidence to corroborate his account than that of Mr Zaman i.e pre-cons<br />Need to find out more about
1,14729,3901,14556,11.4  It is now known that there is a new suspect in the case, a mr. Hussein that already has a conviction in what would consider terrorist activities using chemical weapons and has been heard preaching that all non-believers will be killed using chemical weapons.<br />It is also known that while mr. Jones only has one charge in 2000 relating to sex with a minor, he is proficient in chemistry (a chemistry teacher).  This puts him as a suspect as he is very well knowledged in materials that could cause the outbreak that has been occuring.  However, he is seen by others as a very kind and social individual, not entirely fitting for an individual reaking chaos in his city.<br />Mr. Zaman, conversely, has several charges dating back to 1999 in all areas including resisting arrest, protesting, assault, bodily harm, etc.  This acts to negate the positive light he attempted to put himself into after his argument with mr. Jones as an innocent neighbour just wanting some sleep.<br />The evidence from the bullet hole is still inconclusive as it is not known in which direction the bullet came from (jones or zaman&#039;s yard)<br />What is also known now is that while no conclusive evidence has been delivered with regards to the cause of the outbreak, what these individuals are dying from is clear.  They are experiencing multiple organ failure (kidney, renal, etc.) after all of the symptoms they are coming in with.
1,14730,3902,14558,10.4 he is still prime suspect. he is able to make posion things and he has motive. even he might involve terrorist  he is 80% guilty.
1,14731,3913,14556,14.4 I know that there have been instructions  given from a Mosque in Liverpool to commit widespread poisoning to all &quot;non believers&quot;. These orders have been given by an extremist with a criminal history of owning a chemical weapon. I know that Mr. Zaman  has a long criminal history including several breaches of peace at anti-war demonstrations. Mr Jones appears to be a credible witness (however I think he should be investigsated as to the safety of his chemistry tuition of Mrs. Dixons daughter, due to his only past conviction of sex with a minor). He has been working overtime so is likely to be awake at odd hours of the night, enabling him to witness his neighbours frequent late night meetings. I think Mr. Zaman has been attending the Mosque and has decided to take it upon himself to commit the poisoning outbreak along with groups of other extremists. Mr. Zaman has a long history of violence so it is likely that it was him who shot the hole in the fence. It is vital to know who these other extremists are and the method used for carrying out the attacks.

1,14747,3911,14556,1. Turn 4.1 I have recieved a patholigist report for one of the fatalities. The man&#039;s name was Stephen. He was 40 years old, with grey hair, green eyes possibly. He was admitted with the same symptoms as listed before. The autopsy report suggests that he died from organ failure. I think the pathologist&#039;s name was Dr. Turner. The patient lived in Sefton park.<br />I was given a &quot;character reference&quot; by Mrs. Dixon for Keith Jones. She said that he was a nice man. That he helps her niece/daughter/grandaughter (I&#039;m not sure which) with her chemistry homework. He is an ex-chemistry teacher who now works in the flour-factory. She said that he has been working very hard recently in order to pay off his mortgage.<br />I was also given a criminal history list for Keith Jones, S. (It think his surname might be Zaman) and Muhammed Hussein. Keith Jones was convicted of having sex with a minor and was given 2 years in prison. I think he was born in Berkinshire (or something similar). S. has a longer criminal record going back to I think 1999. His record consists of criminal damage (aroun &pound;100 usually), assault (including on a police officer, theft and also breach of the peace (one of these was for an anti-war protest. His alias is Saber and he was bron in Pakistan.<br />Muhammed Hussein has a history of one offence. He was fould guilty of possesion of or intent to make chemical weapons. He is known to &quot;preach&quot; in a mosque in liverpool and warns of retaliation against the people of liverpool by poisoning them through their water supply.<br />I need to know if Keith Jones has really being working to pay of his mortgage. The flour factory could be contacted to check if he has been doing overtime. I need to know if Muhammed Hussein would have the means to poison the water supply of liverpool. I would also need to know what sort of chemicals could possibly be used to poison people through the water supply, that would cause organ failure. And also how easy it would be to get hold of these chemicals. For instance would a chemistry teacher have it in his lab stores?

This factory distributes flour and bakery treats to much of Britain. Psychological offender profile produced. Not sure what much of this is based on...how relevant or reliable it may be. Hospital under increasing strain due to number of patients. A search of Mr jones&#039; house revealed a number of items  - funnel and chemicals - and a &#039;recipe&#039;. Not sure what this is to make. Mr Jones used to be a chemistry teacher and still tutors so the presence of these materials may not be explained. Picture of gunshot hole in fence examined - close range rifle. No weapon was found at either mans address.
1,14765,3901,14556,11.5  It is now known that Mr. Jones that the makings of what might be necessary to create a chemical weapon in his home, but this could be explained by the fact that he is a chemistry teacher.  These materials may also explain his daughter&#039;s science project that he was apparently helping to work on.  While Mr. Jones does fit the description given in the profile for what the offender will likely be, I find it unlikely that this is the individual responsible for the attacks.<br />Mr. Zaman clearly is going through a rough time as he has been laid off his job, along with everyone else at the flour factory with insufficient compensation that was promised to them.  This explains his hostile nature and some of the convictions he may have acquired in the list of offence charges he has collected over the years.  I still need to know more information on Mr. Hussein in order to get a better picture of this individual, their demeanor, and their lifestyle.

1,14771,3901,14557,I am rather confident that i have an accurate understanding of the incident (80%)
1,14772,3907,14556,Flour factory is going to close in Liverpool and 2000 employees are going to lose their jobs. Mr Zaman is one of the employee and has declared to the press that they were angry of being letting down.<br />Mr Zaman and Mister Jones &#039; houses have been searched by police and policers found materials they found suspicious and the receipe of a cake with poison product.<br />An expert made a profile of the supsect who could have poisoned the area; man between 20-30, with no social skills but intelligent. Superficially non threatening appearance, probably living 5-10miles from the Royal Liverpool Hospital.<br />We need to investigate what the recipe is about and what was the use of it.<br />What could be the motives of Mr Jones and if he was also working at the flour factory.<br />Further research on Mr Hussein, Zaman and Jones are requiered and a geographical profiling could be run. 5
1,14773,3909,14560,no not stressed, 0%
1,14774,3903,14559,9.5 Mr Z and Mr J should be brought in for questionning - see how they react and the nature of their relationships. Why did they go to the police about the shooting if they were working together? Just draws attention to them. If they did it to try and set each other up - can they be broken? Can they instigate each other?
1,14775,3906,14558,6.5<br />- Individual 1 (Keith Jones): 80%<br />- Although not unusual for a chemistry teacher, the finding of instructions for Ricin and the knowledge of extra-hours working (suppousably on a daughter&#039;s project). Furthermore, being affected by the closure of the factory.<br />- Individual 2: 40%<br />- Also was affected by the closure of the factory. Moreover, he was known to suspected of engaging in radical preachings and relating to know radical clerics. Despite this, he&#039;s exposure through police complaints and newspapres contributions, would go against a plan of keeping a low profile in order to carry out any type of attack.
1,14776,3910,14559,turn 5<br />2<br />for the first case, I would select Mrs. keith jones as probable suspect because some materials probably used to cause death of citizens was found in her house and she seems to have possible motivation in that she has compalints about poor fringe benefit from the work. Further geographical information can be used to support this argument<br />for the second case, I would select Mr. zaram as possbile suspect, but with no much certainty
1,14777,3907,14557,55% 5
1,14778,3901,14558,Mr. Zaman (40%)<br />Mr. Hussein (65%)
1,14779,3906,14559,6.5<br />- Charge Individual 1.
1,14780,3902,14558,10.5. Mr jones has 100% guilty. he planned even he had time to decide not to do while making posionous things. he did and he harm people.
1,14781,3903,14560,Dont think they should be charged - not enough information. but if have to then both in connection with the production of chemical/biological weapons.
1,14782,3905,14556,7.5 - Profile recommends the offender is male, 20-30yrs old.  That to naive people he would appear unthreatening.<br />Investigation into the shooting found no rifle at either address, but mortar &amp; pestle, scales, coffee grinder etc at Mr Jones&#039; address. Photos were taken. Yet these items are all general &amp; found in all kitchens are not really suspicious in themselves.  However a note explaining how to make &#039;rian&#039; was found &amp; it was determined that it was Mr Jones&#039; handwriting. I dont know what that is but Im assuming it is a chemical poison that could produce the types of symptoms &amp; causes of death that have been seen in liverpool a&amp;e recently. This does seem suspicious.<br />Also, a newspaper article dated 16th march shows violence breaking out at the factory where Mr Jones works. It has been shut &amp; workers are protesting their severance pay. However it was also noted that Mr Zaman who was chief of medicine also worked there &amp; complained about the low redundancy money. He also said that he hoped people would take notice of them.<br />It appears then that Mr Jones &amp; Mr Zaman worked for the same company. However this was not mentioned in their witness statements.  Also, it is possible that they are working together on poisoning the city. It is also possible that if Mr Jones is having an affair with the previously mentioned 15yr old girl then maybe Mr Zaman is blackmailing him into giving him the recipe for rian, or even blackmailing him to create it for him.<br />I believe both Mr Zaman &amp; Mr Jones are involved in some way but I cannot attributed blame yet.
1,14783,3908,14559,turn 5 (#3)<br />case 1: the professor, he seens have motivation for this<br />case 2: negro man, those found in his house are really evidence
1,14784,3902,14559,10.5. Mr. Jones.
1,14785,3902,14560,10.5. attempted murder
1,14786,3906,14560,6.5<br />- Charge him with intend and possibly carrying out of mass attacks involving Ricin poison.
1,14787,3900,14558,12.5 Water source(10%)<br />Food source - perhaps bakery goods from factory (40%) 2 suspects had access.<br />Terrorist - Mr Zaman, (10%) Mr Jones (10%)  or third man previously mentionned (10%). Other (20%)<br />Water source and food source not investigated.
1,14788,3905,14557,7.5 - 80%, I know I don&#039;t have the full story &amp; Mr Jones needs to be interviewed to see what his reasons are for having such a recipe in his house. We still need to establish HOW the victims are being poisoned...is their water supply infected with this chemical? And if so, whats the common water supply source? Do the suspects have any connections with the source?
1,14789,3903,14561,More stress when there are large amounts of information coming in and not enough time to read all in detail - would benifit from deligating information and group discussions about theories. At the begining there is not enough info to act quickly but when there is there is too much and must prioritse.
1,14790,3905,14558,7.5 - same possible suspects as before...they could be working together.
1,14791,3912,14557,13.5 50% I need more information about Mr. Hussein who is one of te key persons relating to ths incidnet, and request more pesonal information about Mr. Jones. Especially, Mr. Jones&#039;s information when he was in prison are requested to undersand the incident more claery.
1,14792,3913,14556,14.5 Events have now turned dramatically. Mr. Jones does not appear as innocent as he seems. Regarding the crime of the shooting in Garstrom Rd, no weapon was found in either house, however the search revealed that Mr Jones has been involved in the poisoning outbreak- ricin recipies were discovered along with the neccessary equipment. In light of the current situation of the flour factory closing, it is apparent neither Mr Zaman or Mr Jones are particularly happy about it. Mr Jones has gone as far as to have gained the equipment and recipies required for carrying out the attacks. I believe there is the possibility that his knowledge in chemistry may be of key concern here. I think now there is the strong possibilty that perhaps it was Mr Jones making the noise late at night and perhaps he was responsible for shooting the fence after Mr Zaman asked him to be quiet. The shooting implies a level of aggression that may be fuelled by the recent closure of Mr. Warringtons. I need to review all the information again in order to give a firmer indication of what is going on, as I feel I have forgotten some key pieces of information.
1,14793,3906,14561,6.5<br />- The overload of information, at the beginning unrelated, and the unability to record everything was stressful.<br />- Furthermore, the inability to draw diagrams and lay-out the information, in order to achieve a better visual understanding, also put more pressure on the task.<br />- Overall Stress: 60%
1,14794,3901,14559,11.5  I would charge Mr. Zaman as he may have had the motive to seek revenge for losing his job and the opportunity to taint the flour in the factory as he was a supvisor before his job ended.
1,14795,3904,14556,8.5.1 News of a closure of a flour mill on 16th March led to dispputes which invlove Mr Zaman. However this comes later than the initail report of a deceaced patient of the afore mentioned symptoms.<br />paraphernalia found in Mr Jones&#039; house following a search of both Mr Zaman and Mr Jones&#039; house when looking for a gun matching the ballistics reports. This paraphernalia is highly suspicious suggesting tools capable of contaminating water sources.<br />Psychological report offers a character profile of the likely suspect, many characters can be linked to Mr Jones i.e. as he has been convicted of sex with a minor, this suggests that he is able to manipulate situations &#039;to his advantage&#039;. Also as emotionally immature this explains why he spends a lot of time with the 15yr old girl (character witness report) helping with her GCSE&#039;s. Further, the psychological report suggests that the suspect is unable to retain an authentic relationship hence his affinity for underaged girls. Also he is able to give a good impression of himself to the wider community, leading others to trust him i;e; even with their children. Obviously very deceitful able to get a job with kids despite having such a pre con.
1,14796,3908,14561,heap!! i think most of the time... principal when a had few information... and I am still
1,14797,3904,14557,95% Lots of concrete evidence and circumstantial/
1,14798,3900,14559,12.5 Based on the information provided I would charge Mr Zaman. Not sure what with. Further investigation and linking of information to crimes is needed. Not ruling out other possible suspects.
1,14799,3905,14559,I dont believe that I have sufficient evidence to make a charge. Everything so far is purely circumstantial. I need suspect statements, witness reports, and to know how the victims are being poisoned.<br />I am not charging anybody now.
1,14800,3910,14560,possibly Mrs. Keith Jones could be charged with the attempted murder<br />and Mr. Zaram could be charged with illegal possesion of weapon and threatening
1,14801,3907,14558,Mr Zaman: 40%, could be very angry about the fact he is going to lose his job and want to punish people. He has antecedents of violence and protests.<br />Mr Jones: 40%, seems to be quiet but could have some frustrations that need to been investigate further on. Suspicious Material have been found in his home.<br />Mr Hussein:40%, he has threatened population to spread poison in Water in Liverpool. He has alredy been convicted for making chemical product.

1,14803,3908,14560,sorry my bad english ... i can not tell about this, i did not undestand... so..
1,14804,3903,14556,psychological report unhelpful - some aspects like geographical are ok but dont need info on character - could be very misleading. Need to use more fact.
1,14805,3900,14560,12.5 not sure - possible terrorist involvement? but would need more proof!!
1,14806,3901,14560,11.5  I am not sure what my options are or the correct legal terms, but charging mr. zaman with 72 counts of murder and intention to harm
1,14807,3907,14559,None
1,14808,3905,14561,The only stress I experienced was the lack of relevant information. I think half a job was done - 30%
1,14809,3913,14557,14.5 My confidence has now dropped somewhat as I feel I have been caught up in the bias I earlier tried to avoid with respect to Mr. Zaman&#039;s extremist activities. I am now aware of Mr. Jones&#039; part in the incident but fail to see why he would commit such an act. I am now only 50% sure I have an accurate understanding of the incident.
1,14810,3900,14561,12.5 Not stressed. 0% Tired. This feels very long.

1,14812,3911,14556,1. turn 5.1<br />Paul Stevens (BSc Psych, MSc Forensic Pysch, PhD, Clini Psych) from the behavioural science unit in sheffield prepared an offender profile that was to be used for suspect prioritization. It is fairly useless. It suggests that the offender is male, b/w 20-30. This information is not particularly useful as it decribes most possible offenders of crimes. Also his decription of the beahvioural characteristics of the offender were not particularly insightful. He said that the offender was likely to be angry but able to control it (at least at a superficial level). That he would have had problems with maintaining lasting relationships etc.He suggests that the offender porbably lives b/w/ 5 and 10 miles of the Royal Liverpool University hospital. Again it is usual for most offenders of most crimes type to live close to the crime site. Infact the suspect may live closer than 5 miles.<br />Keith Jones&#039; house was searched and several items were found including instructions for making &quot;Rian&quot;. I am not an expert in the field of chemistry so this report was of little use to me. I would need to know what Rian is an what it is used for, as well as the meanings of the chemical notation (i.e the atomical structure of the chemicals) throughout the instrucitons.<br />The liverpool echo (16th march 2006) reports that the W. flour factory i closing on the following monday and that over 2,000 jobs with be lost. Also that the works are very angry, esp. over the severance pay. Mr Shezand Zamand (S.) is/was the head machine operations officer and he expressed his disappointment with the poor severance pay, which was lower than what they were promised.
1,14813,3904,14558,As a result of the latest evidence, particularly the paraphernalia at Mr Jones&#039; house, it is most likely that he is the culprit. Forensic Tests on the paraphernalila can clarify whether the substances are actually consistent with the components of the bacterial source.
1,14814,3901,14561,11.5<br />Yes!!! I felt stressed for time in reading the material in the envelopes because in the later envelopes there was a great deal of information to go over and not enough time to thoroughly go over it all (60%)

1,14927,3923,14920,Does it get challenged? In what way?
1,14928,3932,14841,Bring back Viv and Fletch to SDL
1,14929,3924,14925,it does&#039;nt have to be big
1,14930,3924,14840,a simple thanks is often better that a piece of paper
1,14931,3928,14909,Real police work is getting out on the streets, caring for victims and bringing offenders to justice, rather than looking the other way
1,14932,3921,14840,The very rare formal commendation, the occasional good word from the Inspector. More importantly, the positive feedback received from fellow team members.
1,14933,3931,14840,a thankyou well done usually suffices, there are commends pdp4&#039;s etc
1,14934,3929,14840,being told on a one to one that i&#039;m doing the right thing
1,14935,3927,14840,Vary rarely, an occasional PDP 4
1,14936,3929,14840,the odd thing is a commendation, you get recommended for several but get none!
1,14937,3919,14840,sometimes i get a comment from a supervisor that the job is well done.  The senior bosses don&#039;t recognise this they are only interested in figures.  A major job is only one figure while a few minor ones are more recognised as they are more than one.
1,14938,3924,14840,we need to recognise the simple things that we do - not just the &#039;big jobs&#039;
1,14939,3930,14840,only the most high profile jobs get recognised by superiors. There are always words of thanks from other colleagues. My peers know each others strengths and that is recognised.
1,14940,3926,14840,The good supervisers will send a personal e-mail, thanking people for a good job, the occassional bonus payment.
1,14941,3928,14840,This depends on who your supervisoin is. If they are good and recognise good work, then PDP 4&#039;s and bonus payments are forthcoming. I personally think that just saying thanks makes people feel valued. Poor supervison do nothing and do not inspire confidence, making me feel under valued and just a number.
1,14942,3933,14840,Is public recognition valued?  Is it often received?
1,14943,3919,14842,We don&#039;t know which direction the job is going and what they want us to do. They change the goalposts every few months.
1,14944,3927,14928,And Vic Swift !
1,14945,3928,14930,I agree but in these days of PDP&#039;s the piece of paper is also necessary !
1,14946,3929,14840,the PDP5 system is rubbish and doesn&#039;t get used
1,14947,3933,14943,examples?
1,14948,3924,14842,uncertainty and confidence is affected
1,14949,3931,14842,As a Police officer we dont have a defined role
1,14950,3929,14842,a totally cabbaged head
1,14951,3921,14842,If your role isn&#039;t properly defined, you&#039;ll probably have little chance of achieving any objective.
1,14952,3928,14842,People have no direction and no specific focus. Sometimes people lneed to be given specifics then there is no misunderstanings on what is required.
1,14953,3924,14943,I think that we know our role - management often change it
1,14954,3926,14842,lack of direction, bobbies going off doing their own thing not being available to assist colleagues with our &#039;core business&#039;.
1,14955,3932,14842,Every month the goal posts are changed this month con and use have any of us had real specialist traing in this field...NO but bosses want this done and its a P.I....
1,14956,3933,14951,What definitions would you like to see put in place?  Would they be force wide or just apply to each division?
1,14957,3927,14842,Management have spent months re-organising causing undue delay, uncertainty and speculation. There&#039;s no specific role focus and our aims change all the time
1,14958,3930,14842,Others - more senior supervisers - just do not know what it is that we do. They do not understand the training involved, our role profile or needs
1,14959,3929,14943,there always seems to be something urgent and critical to produce enforcement results with no actual evidence or intelligence to back it up
1,14960,3919,14947,telling us to deal with level 2 crime and then going back to seizing vehicles.
1,14961,3932,14842,How many times have the changes been put off Bosses cant decide our role or whats goint to happen what hope for us numpties
1,14962,3929,14943,you end up doing all kinds of jobs without concentrating on the ones that matter
1,14963,3924,14842,section supervisors need to be more visible to officers - hopefully when the fatal section comes that will happen
1,14964,3927,14843,chest pains
1,14965,3930,14843,I eat more
1,14966,3924,14843,headaches
1,14967,3919,14843,I get anoyed and go quiet, keeping away from people
1,14968,3928,14964,I seem to get these too! Roads Policing is a great place to work though. Hmmmmm
1,14969,3924,14843,eat rubbish
1,14970,3929,14843,where&#039;s the rennie?
1,14971,3926,14843,short fuse, start snapping at poeple, especially in the mornings.
1,14972,3930,14843,I just want to walk away. I know things are piling up but I can&#039;t be bothered
1,14973,3929,14843,sleep what&#039;s that
1,14974,3932,14843,Short tempered,become even more frustrated with job.<br />Crack open the Dalwhinny
1,14975,3927,14843,Poor tolerance levels, moody, headaches, dont want to mix with people
1,14976,3921,14843,A feeling of wild inner frustration concealed beneath a cold, icy controlled exterior.
1,14977,3924,14843,drink wine - lots
1,14978,3931,14843,Stress- the most over used word in the Police
1,14979,3929,14964,blood pressure tablets - being told by the doc you&#039;re a heart attack waiting to happen, joy
1,14980,3928,14843,Very quiet and perhaps a bit moody. Get told off at home when I behave like this ! Starting to recognise this more
1,14981,3929,14974,everyone and everything gets on your nerves
1,14982,3924,14843,poor quality sleep - wake up tired !
1,14983,3933,14843,How often do you visit the dr. with symptoms that are directly related to work stress?  Does it effect work attendance?
1,14984,3927,14843,when I start hating going to work
1,14985,3928,14972,I certainly agree with you there. Why is that
1,14986,3929,14843,the threat of having your threshold payment taken off you if you go sick, makes you feel great
1,14987,3932,14843,Seek warm words of encouragement from Inspectors and above to be told stress you dont know it,try sitting in an office all day Its that bad for me Im away at 1530hrs everyday
1,14988,3924,14986,where does the threat come from
1,14989,3921,14983,Never felt the need to.
1,14990,3927,14986,or being moved if your off for 6 weeks is a great comfort
1,14991,3930,14983,you would get stressed even thinking about taking time off work
1,14992,3929,14987,being told atleast you get your overtime paid!
1,14993,3928,14983,Never go and see him regrading stress. Never go off work neither. Because if you do the work is still there when you come back, the relentless push for widget counting rather than the quality goes on
1,14994,3924,14844,I do&#039;nt listen to family&#039;s issues
1,14995,3932,14844,I dont really and I hope I never would
1,14996,3927,14844,I &#039;comfort&#039;  spend
1,14997,3929,14988,the sickness/absence policy as well as if you go sick you won&#039;t get promoted or posting or course you are after
1,14998,3924,14844,I do&#039;nt remember what they tell me
1,14999,3928,14844,We usually have a row, I sulk for a bit, then were fine again.
1,15000,3919,14844,I don&#039;t.  I try not to take work home with me.  My family stress me out but that&#039;s different.
1,15001,3926,14844,I don&#039;t I like my family take it out on colleagues!!!
1,15002,3930,14844,Moody, uncooperative, bickering over nothing. Just want to vegitate in front of the box watching mindless escapism.
1,15003,3929,14990,moved on to a holding section pending your return to work - to where who knows
1,15004,3927,14844,go quiet and need time on my own, try and not take problems home, but sometimes it&#039;s hard not to.
1,15005,3933,15000,What techniques do you use to assist in not taking work issues home with you?
1,15006,3921,14844,I try very hard not to do that, but most people would probably say that. Short tempered/lack of patience most likely.
1,15007,3924,14844,I can&#039;t switch off - we talk and put it into perspective - maybe I&#039;m lucky!
1,15008,3930,15002,re above - I don&#039;t mean to do it but I recognise that I do
1,15009,3924,14844,we should all talk more in work!!
1,15010,3919,15005,I try to let most things go over my head.  I try not to talk about work at home.  If asked about work I give a short response. I then talk about something else.
1,15011,3929,14966,migraines - alway keep migraleve in my drawer
1,15012,3927,15009,we used to when we had canteens !
1,15013,3923,15009,do you get any opportunity to do this?
1,15014,3933,15009,How can this be accomplished, should it be one on one, or something more structured?
1,15015,3929,14967,I just tell them to &#039;F&#039; off more than normal
1,15016,3928,14844,I dont sleep well. keep waking up with the list of things to do when i get to work going around my mind. Thus the knock on effect is when i get home the following evening i am difficult and lazy.
1,15017,3924,15009,we should come earlier on mornings and talk then -
1,15018,3931,15014,compulsory pub de-briefs
1,15019,3919,15014,talking as a group can get it off your chest
1,15020,3929,14844,I get very annoyed because I can&#039;t give the problem or enjoyment the attention it needs
1,15021,3924,15014,just a group caht would do it
1,15022,3928,15009,The way the organisation is now , I think we are all a bit scared to say anything too controversial
1,15023,3930,15014,you have to start with your immediate peers they are the ones who will know what youre going through
1,15024,3927,15017,Yeah right, good idea
1,15025,3924,14845,I do&#039;nt show an interest in their problems - too wrapped up with mine
1,15026,3932,14845,Become short tempered
1,15027,3929,14844,I am lucky my partner is also in stressful job and we talk a lot - but the kids feel left otu
1,15028,3927,14845,I don&#039;t,  there getting the same pressure and stress that I&#039;m getting.
1,15029,3926,14845,closedown, don&#039;t listen, only do things if i really have to when asked. turn in to Kevin!!
1,15030,3919,14845,I don&#039;t take it out on my colleagues.  I do get upset if they are being rude and I tell them.  Then it is forgotten
1,15031,3930,14845,I will talk too much, probably distract them from what they are doing.<br />Bring in the biscuits as an excuse to eat more
1,15032,3924,15017,lates come on earlier - longer changeover time to get staight and talk over coffee and bickies
1,15033,3928,14845,When they make a mistake I think to myself that basic stuff, just get a grip. Perhaps even give them a bit of hard time.
1,15034,3929,14844,i try to recognise early that things are slipping at home and do something about it, go out for a walk, shopping, fishing or something very simple/normal
1,15035,3921,14845,Become quiet and slightly withdrawn, wait for it to blow over, so far it always does. It helps to be working with a good crew.
1,15036,3932,14845,Only tend to worry or become focused on my objective is and not be aware of what their upto or dealing with
1,15037,3929,14845,i try to keep a lid on it as it no use putting pressure on them when they are already pressured
1,15038,3924,14846,OHU ??
1,15039,3932,14846,The Cambrige Pub
1,15040,3929,14845,throw stuff around the office
1,15041,3931,14846,The gym, OHU.
1,15042,3924,14846,supervisors - talking
1,15043,3928,14846,Does the organisation provide any? OHU are far too busy to be bothered with such trivialities.
1,15044,3927,14846,Apparently OHU, but I&#039;m afraid they&#039;re useless.
1,15045,3933,15038,What about OHU, not good? not reliable? not there?....
1,15046,3929,15039,the SIO&#039;s were supposed get to annual stress health checks - that&#039;s well gone, cost too much
1,15047,3919,14846,The OHU.  I don&#039;t really know how they can help but I am sure they can.  Sometimes just talking with a friend at work who understands.
1,15048,3932,14846,OHU for what its worth
1,15049,3933,15041,Are there facilities available?  Are they in good working order?
1,15050,3930,14846,The organisation has the occupational health but again you have to ask. Some supervisors will hold critical incident de-breifs and raise issues but not all
1,15051,3924,15045,too impersonal
1,15052,3927,15045,short of staff, under resourced,
1,15053,3929,15041,not all stations have gyms - you can&#039;t use them anymore during refs times
1,15054,3931,15049,yes
1,15055,3928,15038,OHU seems available for medicals for driving assessments. I dont know anyone who has a good word for this department.
1,15056,3926,14846,OHU- not sure they would be much use though. I&#039;d rather go the Slaughter House with my colleagues.
1,15057,3930,14846,The best resource are your friends
1,15058,3927,15041,Is there a gym at OHU ???  Cool !!!
1,15059,3932,14846,Some Sgts have asked if any back up needed after traumatic incidents-so it cant all be negative
1,15060,3929,15041,trying to fit exercise before or after a 10hr shift is useless
1,15061,3921,14846,The OHU offer some support options that I am aware of. I&#039;ve never felt the need to use those services and unless really desperate, I would be deeply suspicious to ask for them. I wouldn&#039;t want to flag myself up and damage any future prospects.
1,15062,3931,15055,harsh
1,15063,3933,15061,Is confidentiality an issue?
1,15064,3924,15041,can you use gym during work time?
1,15065,3930,14847,yes
1,15066,3929,15038,it&#039;s not all about the OHU, managers and people themselves need to ensure that facilities are in place to avoid or cope with stress related problems
1,15067,3924,14847,yes
1,15068,3931,14847,never used the OHU, but would if needs be
1,15069,3921,14847,No. I think you could be perceived by some as a weak link, not fully dependable.
1,15070,3932,14847,No because once mentioned you may have a problem of any kind, you never know when its going to be used against you
1,15071,3931,15064,yes
1,15072,3930,14847,if you know what helps you, that is what you are going to use
1,15073,3927,14847,No, they&#039;re not readily available and all things discussed go on your personal file.<br />Don&#039;t want to harm my career prospects
1,15074,3919,14847,Not really.  I don&#039;t feel that anything you do at OHU is confidential.
1,15075,3926,14847,No,may have reprocussions if you try for promotion or change role.
1,15076,3933,15070,who would use this information?
1,15077,3929,14847,I want to get fitter and keep it up, we should be given time as most our time is at work.  When you&#039;re at home you just catch up ready for the next working week.
1,15078,3924,15020,you should share it
1,15079,3928,14847,No, not reallly someone commented on the last question, regarding raising a flag and damaging career aspiration. I agree. Do i sound really negative about OHU ? Im sure there are some good people there. Perhaps they could do with having a clearer focus and some direction. This might help.
1,15080,3919,15076,The bosses
1,15081,3927,15076,the organisation. They&#039;re tricky, sneaky people you can&#039;t trust !
1,15082,3930,15076,everthing in the system is recorded and can be produced as evidence
1,15083,3924,15077,do you use the gym at scoff time ?
1,15084,3929,14847,I would only talk to my boss if i could trust them implictly - some have a habit of gossiping and passing on information
1,15085,3928,15076,The negativity regarding this department is incredible. If this does not raise a flag for poor performance, then I dont know what will
1,15086,3927,15083,What&#039;s scoff time ???
1,15087,3929,15083,there isn&#039;t a gym a bromborough and instructions are that you can&#039;t use it at scoff anyway - that needs to change
1,15088,3929,15083,there aren;t enouhg people top cover refs times or even take one
1,15089,3924,15088,we need to change this
1,15090,3924,14841,shorter shifts
1,15091,3931,14841,more training
1,15092,3924,14841,inspectors working on sections
1,15093,3927,14841,Increase staff levels<br />Listen to staff concerns<br />Increase management understanding of roles, and define clearewr structure and role
1,15094,3931,15091,proper traffic officer training
1,15095,3923,14928,what did they do well that you want them back?
1,15096,3929,14928,long live fletch - most definately
1,15097,3926,14928,Change back to a Traffic Department! More specialist training.
1,15098,3919,14928,Get rid of beancounters
1,15099,3932,14841,Get most of the Inspectors etc out of day jobs and put them back on the spike
1,15100,3927,15092,or just working would be a start !
1,15101,3923,15090,maximum time limit? Please specify.
1,15102,3929,14841,we need a new department head - ok then, a Chief Inspector
1,15103,3928,14841,Reduce the bureaucracy and the widget counting. Lets recognise peoples contributions. The organsiation knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
1,15104,3923,15102,what do you need from a new dept head?
1,15105,3932,14841,Send Shakey to the Isle of White to sort their sheep rustling problem out
1,15106,3927,15103,couldn&#039;t have put it better....
1,15107,3924,14841,I do&#039;nt think our Ch.Insp. would take onboard any of our suggestions
1,15108,3919,14841,more bobbies on the streets instead of offices
1,15109,3923,15105,is sheep rustling a P.I. there?
1,15110,3926,15102,Totally agree, someone who knows what the role of a traffic officer is and what is involved in dealing with a serious RTC
1,15111,3931,15105,or even on a traffic SIO&#039;s course
1,15112,3929,15090,due to the nature of the investigative role (which has now come back from 5.3.07) we should be on 8hr shifts, which is far better on the body and family life
1,15113,3919,15101,8 hours
1,15114,3932,14841,Increase staff levels and clearly define roles
1,15115,3923,15103,how would you recognise contributions? please specify.
1,15116,3930,14841,really like to see the punishment to fit the crime. Road death is still seen as &#039;accidental&#039;. Six years for killing three people, having dragged one of them under his car for 400 m &amp; then running away?!!!
1,15117,3929,15092,working on police work instead of restructure and stats
1,15118,3927,14928,They knew what a Traffic dept was and what our role was
1,15119,3921,14841,The job needs to stop changing direction simply because its the fashion to do so. If something works then leave it alone. Bosses really do need to have the moral fibre to stand their ground and defend their staff and good working practices. Its not being cynical to say this, we see it all the time,  but it seems these bosses are only interested in self furtherment and not departmental betterment. You don&#039;t get anywhere by rocking the boat do you?
1,15120,3929,15099,we should have a night inspector, none of this duty officer stuff
1,15121,3928,14841,Adopt a team approach to the departments performance figures. Let the Sgt&#039;s concentrate on individual good / poor performance. I think this would generate better teamowrk and the poor performers would soon be identifiable by there peers.
1,15122,3923,15114,can you define the role? How do you see it?
1,15123,3924,15115,sergeants should be able to identify this
1,15124,3930,15095,They ay least knew your name and what you did. I&#039;ve only met our boss twice in the year he&#039;s been with us &amp; I think one occasion was only b`ecause he was lost.
1,15125,3926,14841,Promote VIV and let her run the dept.
1,15126,3924,15121,I agree
1,15127,3919,15119,quite right
1,15128,3928,15090,If you go to shorter shifts you loose a lot of rest days. 12 hr shifts would be good then we get more days off, not less. Most of us spend 10 plus hours anyway.
1,15129,3929,15119,just because the chief con has a personal interest in the re-structure of traffic doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s all about statistics, says a lot about the management style though
1,15130,3927,14841,Have hit squads go out in the middle of the night and take out targets
1,15131,3923,15114,and what was the role before the changes?
1,15132,3929,15121,just let the sergeants do their job
1,15133,3921,14841,Bin Niche for summonses and return to paper files. Alternatively, employ admin staff to input the file so the Police Officer can be on the street.
1,15134,3932,14841,Ask Dave Bell what exactly does he do.How much is he on and then get rid of him
1,15135,3927,15119,Correct, It seems that to get promoted you have to change things for the sake of it, whether it needs changing or not
1,15136,3919,15122,our job is to help the public, but we end up helping the bucks with the crime because of being PC.  Lets go back to policing the streets to make it safer.
1,15137,3929,15133,there&#039;s no chance of Niche going or paper files.  The decision has been made.  Crime reporting is going on and min input for RTC&#039;s....
1,15138,3924,15101,8 hour nights
1,15139,3929,15125,give her a H&amp;K, darkened room with Mr S in it
1,15140,3921,14841,A properly directed level two target team has been argued for over three years now. Its a fact of life that we have to put up with petty criminality, but some of these blurts are just taking the mick and need to be sorted. As foxy once said &quot;give me the nuts and bolts and i&#039;ll build the submarine&quot;!!!!!!!!!
1,15141,3932,14841,Get rid of Niche altogether<br />Go back to paper summonses etc
1,15142,3924,15141,be realistic !
1,15143,3929,15091,we need a TPOC again, we can&#039;t examine vehs anymore and can&#039;t find instructors for the City &amp; Guilds qualification to train us
1,15144,3921,14841,Put all the poor bosses on the submarine!
1,15145,3932,14841,Sort out the Civilian CJU staff re handling of files paperwork etc and put Steve Hardy in there.
1,15146,3930,15090,we spend so much time jusifying ourselves to bosses we don&#039;t have the time to actually get on and do what it is we&#039;re suppose to do
1,15147,3919,14841,we should be able to do policing without the thought of getting the right figures for the beancounting.  Lets get these Mr bigs instead of then little guys.
1,15148,3929,15118,not when they put new chap in place, who doesn&#039;t know what we actually are supposed to do and have done since the year dot - the expertise has just withered away retirement after retirement
1,15149,3921,14841,The OSU intel unit needs to be properly staffed with motivated individuals.
1,15150,3928,15102,I dont think he is actually a bad fella. He just gives a lot of knee jerk reactions to problems. I actually think he cares about reducing road death.
1,15151,3919,14841,Instead of depts keeping secrets from each other we should work together to deal with all criminals.  Share information
1,15152,3929,15141,the cju&#039;s just can&#039;t cope with the demand now, since Sec.152 came in summonses have gone through the roof.  The job just won&#039;t pay for any more staff, they are getting rid of 65 head support staff jobs!!
1,15153,3927,14841,Bring in group hugs each day at the start of the shift
1,15154,3924,15120,I agree
1,15155,3919,15144,the bosses arn&#039;t poor
1,15156,3929,15147,but the little guys scurry around for the Mr Bigs, stop them and they can&#039;t operate
1,15157,3928,15149,I agree. Filling it with people who are recovering from illness or who want an easy day job is not the way forward. We need the right people with the right skills to deliver up to date and credible intelligence to make a difference.
1,15158,3921,14841,Compulsory lie detector tests for all staff involved in the presentation of  information to BMG/Level 2 tasking meetings.

1,15160,3926,14848,Non at the moment as i live by myself.
1,15161,3929,14848,although I have had a horrendous 12mths with my teenage daughter I have managed to keep it away from work, mostly
1,15162,3921,14848,Very occasional welfare issues, usually involving the children.
1,15163,3930,14848,Sometimes you cant have the time off to attend family functions but then sometimes you tell relatives you cant go because of work when in fact you&#039;re at home with your feet up
1,15164,3928,14848,The health of close family. Ultimately this is not a dress rehearsal for something better. Make the most of the time we have with the people who are important.
1,15165,3931,14848,my family&#039;s happiness is the most important thing to me. If one of them are unhappy it affects your work. Every decision I make impacts on my family, if they are happy I am.
1,15166,3924,14848,the welfare of my son &amp; wife. If my wife is stressed in her job (also police support staff) then I carry that burden with me in my job.
1,15167,3926,14849,Getting off late. i have to feed the cats nobody to do it for me.
1,15168,3932,14848,How Im feeling that day
1,15169,3927,14848,Getting the balance between shift work and your home life is very important. More often than not one suffers at the expense of the other.<br />I feel at times having a family/home life is not understood by the organisation
1,15170,3919,14848,my wife not understanding why I have to work odd hours.
1,15171,3929,14848,my own health has been a problem, particularly joint problems from on-duty injuries.  It is hard trying to balance getting treatment with keeping a good sickness/attendance record.  I would like to get promoted, so this is hard.
1,15172,3930,14848,Being dragged out of bed when &#039;on call&#039; does disturb my wife
1,15173,3924,14848,I find it very difficult working Nights. I do&#039;nt sleep very well in daytime and after four nights it takes me whole weekend to recover - then I&#039;m back in work.
1,15174,3919,14849,The hours I work and the short notice I get to change shifts
1,15175,3924,14848,I do&#039;nt do a very good job on Nights.
1,15176,3932,14848,The children-how they are etc
1,15177,3930,14848,We have both worked shifts for over twenty years each so are well used to how it is
1,15178,3931,14849,Shifts, but I knew I would be on shifts when I joined. We all suffer from lack of resources, and to a point you just have to get on with it, I dont like it though when a lack of resources means I cant have time off when I want.
1,15179,3932,14849,Hours worked-tiredness
1,15180,3924,14848,Money issues. I feel pressured into working overtime rather that being at home which I would prefer.
1,15181,3919,14849,The cancelation of rest days
1,15182,3929,14848,trying to manage hypertension is also difficult, although now managed by drugs, trying to fit in exercise amongst the long hours is impossible - a vicious circle
1,15183,3932,14849,Stress bought on by bosses P.I.etc and anxiety from this
1,15184,3928,14849,Studying to pass exams in my own time. Time spent trying to get promoted, extra hours at work. The need to stay on after time to make up section shortages. Rest days cancelled at short notice to cover extingencies of the service. Everything seems to be one of these !!!! For instance Christmas and new year staffing levels, Aintree. All these events seems to sneak up on us every year, Please start planning better. It improves all our lives. Home and work.
1,15185,3924,14848,My son is doing his GCSE&#039;s this year - I&#039;m worried about that.
1,15186,3927,14849,Extended shift hours at short notice,<br />Cancelled rest days,<br />varied shift hours
1,15187,3919,14849,My wife suffers because I am not off when she is
1,15188,3924,14848,He&#039;s a typical teenager and needs me there more than I am to keep him in line &amp; motivated
1,15189,3930,14849,self concious of being a police officer in everything I do. I shy away from telling people what I do when on holiday for instance
1,15190,3924,14848,My wife is unhappy in her job
1,15191,3921,14849,Years of shift work impacting negatively on family life. Constantly being late off duty after a 10 hour shift. Working week-ends when the kids are off. I chose to be a Police Officer and was single when I did so. Now married with several children, my wife and kids suffer the consequences, not being able to make the most of all our week-ends together. Days off spent alone.
1,15192,3929,14849,long hours and a very complicated role often take their toll in having regular (instead of sporadic) leisure time with the family
1,15193,3919,14848,My wife not learning my shift patterns
1,15194,3924,14848,My inlaws are getting older - I&#039;m worried for my wife when they die
1,15195,3930,14849,Just being Police when other family member has a gripe - had a big falling out with a brother in law who had heard a story &amp; wouldn&#039;t accept an expaination of how the service works.
1,15196,3921,14849,My wife carries that extra burden of parental responsibility and that is not fair to her. I&#039;m only earning a wage and there are easier ways of doing that in the Police than being a good/self motivated operational officer. I don&#039;t even get the SPP payment and a &quot;day man&quot; gets the same pay as me and I&#039;m no better thought of.
1,15197,3929,14849,being stuck behind a desk for a big part of the day plays havoc with my back and knees, aften on my day off I have to spend time trying to recover from the pain
1,15198,3929,14841,the introduction of the name of &#039;Roads Policing Department&#039; from 5.3.07 is a total joke - we are a Traffic Department and have been eversince the police introduced it.  Why on earth change this?
1,15199,3921,14849,I accept for the most part my lot in the Police, but at least if I was financially compensated for the unsocial hours/disruption to family life, then I may be able to give my wife and kids the benefit of that i.e. days out and extra holidays that at the moment I just cannot afford. More and more I think I should become a &quot;day man&quot;.
1,15200,3930,14841,Stop bosses changing things that already work well just so that they can show &#039;leadership&#039; to help towards their next rank.
1,15201,3921,14849,I have found this research process mildly cathartic by airing certain views, but I honestly cannot see anyone improving the lot of good working bobby. Have a go anyway.
1,15202,3929,14841,why does leaderdship or qualification for promotion have to involve developing &#039;new&#039; processes and complete change at the cost of efficiency or common sense
1,15203,3929,14841,the role is all about policing, arresting the people who deserve it, or investigating the complicated incidents thoroughly
1,15204,3924,14849,shifts - particularly Nights
1,15205,3924,14849,irregular working hours at short notice
1,15206,3931,14836,I am now on a fatal investigation team within the traffic department. A lot of traffic officers avoid dealing with fatals for a variety of reasons. I believe that the fatal investigation team is a specialist department within a specialist department, other traffic officers who opted not to join this type of dept., are left with whatever else needs to be done, they then complain they have no role description, sorry but tough, get on with the choice you made. Stress is being told there is no work for you next week, look for another job, or not being able to pay your mortgage. 30 years of guaranteed work on good money cant be bad. Chris Farley.

Both males claim to have no knowledge of the cause of the gun shot fired through the fence and both fear for the lives of themselves and their families.<br />Evidence need to be carried out to find the direction from which the gun was fired and the type of gun used.  Property searches of both properties may also be useful.<br />The other piece of evidence from the tape and map shows an increase in incidences of the poisoning and an increase in fatalities caused by the toxin.<br />Need to know why these two incidences have been provided at the same time and possibly the occupation of both neighbours.

The Senoior infection control nurse thinks these incresing figures are suspicious.<br />One man made a statement. He claims that at 10.15 he went outside his house. He saw his neighbour and said hello to him, his neighbour ignored him.<br />Later in the day he went outside his house again. His neighbour was sat in his garden and called him over. The neighbour started complaining about the position of the fence - he was insisting that the fence was cutting of land that was rightfully his. The man went away and contacted the council and went over what was his and what was his neighbour&#039;s he found that the land was his own. He then told his neighbour this. The neighbour got very angry, made comments about Iraq and then threatened to kill him. The man went inside his house and told his family to stay at friends. He heard a gun shot and there was a hole in the fence the next day. He thinks the neighbour did it. The neighbour acussed him of being a racist and said &#039;if I was white we wouldn&#039;t be having this problem&#039;.<br />The other statement claimed it was all the other way around and that it was the man who threatened to kill the neighbour when the neighbour went outside to complain of noise as he was tired due to jet lag. The neighbour heard a gun shot and was scared. He thinks it was the man. The next day there was a hole in the fence.

Extremely worrying situation the the senior infection control nurse felt the officer should be awarr of.<br />The was an incident reported between two neighbouring gentleman regarding a gunshot through their shared garden fence. Jones one of the neighbours filed a report that his neighbour zamir, ignored him when he said hello one morning. That afternoon when he saw him again, zamir approached jones and remarked he wanted him to move his fence as it was encroaching onto his land, by 2 metres. Jones did nor agree with this situation and said no. It this jones reported his neighbour accused him of being racist, and said he would move the fence if he was white and accused jones of supporting the iraq war. jones reports hios neighbour then threatned to kill him. jones did fear for his  life and got his wife and kids to stay away for the night. Later that eveing jones reportedly heard a gunshot and was very scared, the next  morning there was a gunshot hole in the fence. Jones reports his neighbour does behave suspiciously with visitors late at night and belives he is part of a terrorist group and a political activist.<br />Zamirs report differed as he claimed he was trying to sleep due to jet lag and his neighbour jones was making excess noise so he went round to complain. upon this jones became angry and threatened to kill him. Zamir ran to his house and locked himself in his room and heard a gunshot and claimed jones shot a hole through the fence.<br />I think i know there is clearly a hostile relationship between these two gentlemen but to what extent each is being truthful is unclear. One would need to find out more about their relatinship and find other witnesses.

This followed symptoms consistent with other patients brought in on suspicion of food poisoning. Need to know the result of more post mortems carried out on patients, are these findings consistent? Need to know if the same bacterium is causing the illnesses.<br />Neighbours case, now know that the hole in the fence was caused by a single shot from close range with a rifle. Also recieved a statement concerning Mr Jones from the mother of a girl he is tutoring, exulting his good nature and his kindness. Recieved three criminal record statements, one for Mr Jones showing a crime of sex with a minor in 2001, one for Mr Hussein showing a terrorism linked charge of attempting to make a chemical weapon in 2001, and one for another man of Pakistani origin (Mr Zahman) showing a history more akin to that described of Mr Hussein, including attending rallies against the Iraq war, it also shows an offence of firearms possession (a rifle) and several offences of actual bodily harm and assault. From this, it would appear that Mr Hussein is opperating under a false identity, although that is only corroborated by the character testament Mr Jones gave after the incident. Need to know more of the background of Mr Hussein, and establish if he is opperating under an assumed name.
1,15281,3953,15209,I think that Zazman may be responsible for the bullet in the fence as he has a very long history-more so than keith- of similar offences-80% guilty.<br />I also think he could have something to do with the poisining outbreak due to the contenty of his extremist speeches and he has a history of similar actions.

Very passionate about his views and frustrated if someone doesnt share them.<br />A newspaper report talks of the closure of flour factory where jones and zamad work, causing much upset and some violence. Jones was saving money for his mortgage and working hard. There have been two arrests due to violence due to unhappy workers.<br />Jones and zamads houses were searched and no rifle found.

Violence erupted at the factory and bricks were thrown through windows.<br />A search team looked for a riffle in both number 15 and 17 but didn&#039;t find anything, However, they did find apparatus in Keiths flat such as scales, rubber gloves and a syringe.

The fact that he is an ex chemistry teacher also supports the fact that he would be well equiped to prepare the compound and somehow distribute it through his job at the flour factory.<br />His neighbour also works at the same place and they have both lost their jobs.<br />Need to make sure that it is the factory that is the distributor of the ricin and the access both neighbours have in the factory.<br />Still consider if Hussein worked at the factory or knows either man and look into the political and religious beliefs of Jones.

1,15295,3951,15207,T5 P7<br />know that the place that both Mr Zaman and Mr Jones work has closed down this could act to aggrevate both, so may provide either with a motive, however the factory is in warrington so why target liverpool. both suspects could se seen to fit in with the profile, apart from Mr Jones having a family, but the profile acts as guidelines only they are not to be taken as gosple, and could apply to a great number of people.<br />various equiptment that could be used to make a poison was found in Mr Jones&#039;s house, howvere as an exchemistry teacher this does not necessarily point towards his guilt. he did howvere have a certain recipe in his possession which is suspicious, but again all chemistry teachers have the knowledge of how to make poisons, but why would Mr Jones write it down, as this is not the kind of thing you would be teaching in a chemistry lesson.<br />both Mr Jones and Mr Zaman need to be further interviewed to identify a motive for Mr Jones, as apart from the factory closure (which wasnt in liverpool) and to frame mr Zaman there is no clear motive, he also needs to be questioned about the items and recipe found at his house. Mr Zaman extermist views, if he has any need to be clirified.<br />microbiology reports from the hospital are needed to determine whether the recipe found in Mr Jones&#039;s house fits in with the bacteria found in the victims and if the symptoms present would be caused by this recipe.

1,15307,3956,15207,Turn 5, 3: The incidents now appear to be linked, the &#039;food poisoning&#039; incident may infact be a deliberate poisoning using a chemical substance. The lab reports suggested that there was a bacterium present in all the samples taken from patients, this is not consistant with a chemical poisoning, unless it was a naturally occuring bacterium, although there is still no information for the identity of the bacterium involved. The multiple organ failure seen in the post mortem report is consistent with a chemical poisoning. Mr Jones, a former chemistry teacher, had a detailed method and some of the required equipment for making ricin, which could be used as a chemical poison, possibly in the water system. Although Mr Hussein did also have a previous conviction for chemical weapons manufacture. The houses of the two men (Mr Jones and Mr Hussein) were searched and no rifle was recovered. Mr Zahman was interviewed for the local paper after losing his job at the local flour factory, suggesting that he is a seperate person from Mr Hussein. The social links between the three men need to be established, as the only one with a history of firearms possesion, Mr Zahman may have had a part to play in the shooting incident. Mr Zahman and Mr Hussein both seem to have a radicalised religious view, from the police reports and from character statements.

1,15668,4033,15641,The most stressful aspects of the job, to me are not operational problems. The main things that stress me are  trying to get days off when I ask for them.Trying to balance a life with a demanding job. Short notice for shift changes and not getting the credit for the job we do as AFO&#039;S IE. a low SPP compared to other areas and depts.
1,15669,4030,15641,Having your shifts altered and lengthened at short notice and subsequently being forced to work overtime that is unwanted.  Lack of parking spaces in the car park.<br />Positive discrimination against the perfectly capable majority.  Instructors not being working ARV&#039;s and not being fully aware of actual situations, which require diversion from text book tactics, they are subsequently dictating tactics and scenarios from an ivory tower.

1,15673,4038,15670,can you give an example of what kind of things?
1,15674,4029,15642,On a personal level, the support can be very good. However, this is reliant on the personality of the senior officer. When the Organisation becomes involved, inflexibility often takes over. The job has lots of processes and proceedures on paper, however they lack effectiveness when tested.
1,15675,4030,15642,Gives opportunity to refine our skills by regular training.
1,15676,4028,15641,working for a department who think they are doing us a favour by letting us work in firearms instead of thanking or rewarding the hard work that we do despite the impact it has on our family and social life
1,15677,4033,15659,We are not properly measured for the firearms jobs we do, they are more interested in traffic tickets than how many firearms jobs we go.
1,15678,4037,15659,Agree with above - performance indicators that don&#039;t even link to our role
1,15679,4036,15663,some officers are given lower standards of fitness to attain or in some cases a blind eye seems to be passed of failures or poor tactical performance
1,15680,4035,15641,Performance indicators, Policing has lost its way, we are more interested in what we are percieved to be doing rather than what we are actually achieving. The lack of worth put on my specialist role,if you complain, you are told, if you dont like it you can leave the department, apparently people are knocking the door down to do my menial role!!!!. i feel like we are a necessary evil that should be hidden away until the jobs become to dangerous for our unarmed colleagues then we are indisposable.
1,15681,4030,15643,Dealing with serious criminals and making a real difference to the vunerable public.
1,15682,4043,15642,There is a lack of support from management often resulting in management distancing themselves from officers when support is needed most.

1,15690,4044,15642,The organisation supports me by way of offering me more support than is always necessary which sometimes causes resentment, which I fully understand..
1,15691,4033,15642,The support comes mainly from peers and first line managers. ie Section Sgts. The sad fact is there is very little support from Inspectors and ranks above that. The fact that we have been given a derisory SPP underlys the lack of support the management have for AFO&#039;S
1,15692,4036,15643,to be involved in high profile incidents and take some high level crooks off the street
1,15693,4044,15643,Dealing with high profile criminals and bringing them to justice.
1,15694,4033,15643,Actually dealing with firearms incidents and full response stops etc. The main pleasure I get from the job without sounding negative are my rest days.Enough said..
1,15695,4037,15642,I do not think we get sufficent support from management. It appears we have a firearms dept because we are required too. The dept is understaffed and equipment lacking.
1,15696,4029,15644,By a structured reward process. This can sometimes fail due to the workload of the individual who wishes to reward good work, getting in the way of the submission. The best way can sometimes be a personal approach, phone call etc. However, this does not satisfy the rigid &#039;evidence&#039; process.
1,15697,4033,15687,pursuits....
1,15698,4044,15643,Three days off after nights!!!
1,15699,4028,15680,The most important performance indicator we should have in a firearms dept. is the number of incidents we attend and deal with as ARV&#039;s, however this as almost seen as a negative thing. How can a force or dept. send unarmed area officers to reports of firearms or edge weapons when they have better equiped, better trained armed response patrols available. I wonder is the job waiting for the first unarmed officer to be killed before they address this issue?
1,15700,4035,15642,my support comes from my section colleagues and other con&#039;s on the department, i would, possibly, go to my sgt&#039;s if i felt the need, but would be very resistant in going above this rank as i have no trust or faith in my senior supervisors, i feel that they would use my need for support as a way of ticking a box for there next promotion.
1,15701,4036,15644,PDP forms which show recognition of good work although some bosses are more interested in the aspects of our work which make them look good ie high volume performance indicators such as stop checks  and fixed penalty notices
1,15702,4033,15644,commendations, letters of appreciation and the most common is the PDP/4 a document we recieve when a good pice of work has been carried out.
1,15703,4044,15644,The personal approach of &quot;that was a good job &quot; from fellow colleagues.
1,15704,4028,15642,They could do a lot better in all aspects of support and make this department a great place to work as opposed to a crap place to work but a great job.
1,15705,4029,15659,People are selected for posts and roles based on &#039;face fits&#039; principle. However, the job insists it always runs open and honest processes.
1,15706,4037,15643,Taking a major part in disrupting major criminals - when we are given the chance and not being pressured to get PI&#039;s
1,15707,4043,15644,The PDP process, however this is floored as you quite often receive a positive PDP from management for a basic job just to satisfy the managers individuals goals.
1,15708,4030,15644,Colleagues give personal praise and critisicm as do direct supervisors, which has a direct impact.  But senior management rarely give recognition and when they do it is often not personal, i.e getting your name or number wrong. It feels as if the recognition is given (by senior officers) as a matter of duty because somebody has told them that an officer requires some praise,  not as a result of them digesting and appreciating the indivduals efforts.
1,15709,4033,15695,strongly agree
1,15710,4028,15642,We are let down by managers with regards to training ie shooting practice, equipment, the balance between work life and family life, the only postive support we seem to get is from our sargeants.
1,15711,4035,15643,Camaradery (sorry about the spelling). feeling needed, as part of a team achieving a goal that would be impossible without team work.<br />Arresting someone of criminal worth, making them fear you, as they have made others fear them letting them know they are shite.<br />Adrenaline, the rush of excitement when the job goes down (well).
1,15712,4029,15641,Lack of support from senior officers who are affraid and unwilling to make decisions because of the possible repercussions from their seniors.
1,15713,4044,15644,Being given feedback from supervisors or bosses who knows nothing about you or the job you have done, other than being told about it so they can tick a box in there PDP to say they have given feedback, both positive or negative
1,15714,4029,15641,micro management of day to day issues by very senior officers.
1,15715,4036,15695,our department is an expensive necessary evil begrudged most of the time yet depended on to be the most reliable and proffesional of deparments when called upon
1,15716,4044,15645,Misunderstandings, heated arguments and lack of ownership of incidents you may attend!
1,15717,4037,15644,PDP forms can give confirmation that you have done a job well and this can be kept for evidence to prove you are compatent at your job. This however is a paper exercise the real recognition comes from coments from front line managers and colleagues
1,15718,4028,15643,Dealing safely with firarms incidents, using your skills and experience working as part of a team to achieve this. The thrill of being in the middle of a dynamic, stressful incident were most normal people would run a mile from, its fun!
1,15719,4036,15689,can be a little over bearing at times - is it always appropriate to debrief incidents repeatedly, making those involved re live a situation they would rather not have been part off ?
1,15720,4033,15645,We are foremost a firearms department and the long term plan we are told is to be the best firearms department in the country, yet i feel we as AFO&#039;s are in Limbo. We have FIM&#039;S who are loathe to send us to incidents that are obviously jobs for us to deal with.We have the tools to do so and we are trained enough to deal with them, but time and time again we hear on the radio, &quot;AREA TO DEAL&quot;. This shows lack of clarity for our role, I honestly think that some FIM&#039;S are too cosy in their role and dont want a shooting on their watch.
1,15721,4036,15645,Lack of direction from managers
1,15722,4035,15644,By recieving a worthless piece of paper with four lines on it,These are needed and given out only to add to more useless paper called a PDP, otherwise i dont think they would exist.  I would be happier if the boss actually spoke to me and asked about the job and said thanks great job we apppreciate what you did.<br />a word from my peers or a nod of appreciation is all i require ,personaly.

1,15724,4029,15645,Lack of vision as to what is expected of us.<br />Reduced effort, because what you achieve today will be undermined by a complete change in direction tomorrow. Knee jerking from one crisis to the next. Managing symptoms and not causes. &#039;Why bother?&#039;
1,15725,4028,15643,When your not chasing P.I.&#039;s being free to police as you think is most effective.
2,15726,4042,0,What messages would you like to send to Headquarters or senior management?
1,15727,4038,15716,please give examples - who &#039;owns&#039; them if you don&#039;t?
1,15728,4044,15645,Area patrols who may feel at risk attending incidents that they are not equipped to deal with, putting peoples lives at risk.
1,15729,4036,15645,inability to organise and work effectivley as a department in the role we have been trained for.
1,15730,4043,15645,AFO&#039;s that have given in to the PI culture, resulting in them focusing on giving tickets to &quot;decent MOP&quot; in order to satisfy requests from management.
1,15731,4036,15645,sometimes feel we have be brought into the department under faulse pretense
1,15732,4030,15645,It appears that differing offers in differing roles are not working together to improve the effectiveness of policing.  Police personel who are on the front line dealing with incidents as they happen, such as firearms officer,  are being restricted and forced into an increasingly clerical role because people who are carrying out administrative roles would prefer not to take any work on that they do not have to.  The officer workers make it as difficult as possible for frontline officers to hand clerical work over by make the parameters so narrow that it is easier for the officer to do the work himself and short change the tax payer, who has no way of directly complaining, then satisfy the work shy adminstrators requirements before handing a job over and getting back on the street, dealing with criminals face to face.
1,15733,4036,15646,short fuse
1,15734,4029,15646,lack of concentration. anger. sleeplessness. unwilling to get involved and take on further tasks. arguing about the same things. having a fixation on one problem.
1,15735,4036,15646,disturbed sleep , though not so much any more once you realise you cant change anything anyway
1,15736,4044,15646,General feeling of being worn out and not wanting to go into work. Staying at home seems much more inviting.
1,15737,4030,15646,Tired and your attitude for fighting crime is blunted
1,15738,4036,15736,couldnt agree more
1,15739,4029,15736,Constantly being tired and wanting to withdraw.
1,15740,4044,15646,Sleep disruption which has a knock on effect to the rest of your family. Makes you irritable and narky.
1,15741,4035,15645,We are, allegedly specialists, however we are so thin on the ground and so poorly lead and funded, that i feel we are mostly inaffective as a department. this leads to dispondancy and a feeling of uselessness my role should be more directed and target specific, not sent to an area to gather PI&#039;S from stopping kids.
1,15742,4036,15736,lack of enthusiasim (yeah i know i cant spell) for police work, just waiting for end of shift
1,15743,4030,15646,Cannot be bothered to do normal enjoyable tasks in or out of work.
1,15744,4043,15645,Courses or roles being given to the officer with the highest numbers of PI&#039;s as opposed to the best/most competant AFO resulting in inexperienced officers becoming SFO&#039;s
1,15745,4029,15736,Loss of self belief and powerlessness.
1,15746,4037,15645,It appears that we are not trusted to carry out our role as AFO&#039;s as FIM&#039;s will not send us to incidents that clearly require a armed presence
1,15747,4029,15647,Not taking part in family events. Being over critical and unsupportive. Constantly going over and over the things which are effecting me at work.
1,15748,4043,15736,Argumentative
1,15749,4033,15646,I get very wound up, tired and ANGRY. I have found that when dealing with stressful incidents i react better to stress . I strongly believe that it is the extrinsic factors that stress me more like short shifts, no leave etc
1,15750,4036,15647,dont think i do
1,15751,4028,15703,I agree with this 100%, indeed it is for the vas number of good jobs we deal with the only recongnition we get. The sargeants attempt to address this with PDP 4&#039;s but to be honest its not worth the paper its written on. You see other people in other roles being rewarded by way of Chief Cons or Super commendation, for work which in our dept. you would not even get a thank you for from Inspectors or above. Indeed i cant remember the last time the chief inspector last came in person to thanks for your hard work in person, and i cant recall the super ever doing this!
1,15752,4030,15647,become short tempered and do not take their point of view into account, want things done my why or not at all.  Not interest in their feelings or needs.
1,15753,4037,15646,I am informed by my family who notice a change and can tell when things in work are not going well - which is more often than it should be
1,15754,4044,15647,Tend to blow smallest things they do out of proportion like its the end of the world.
1,15755,4036,15648,moan to each other endlessly
1,15756,4043,15646,Short fuse when dealing with MOP, likely to give tickets or arrest for minor offences i would normally warn for.
1,15757,4033,15647,Just can&#039;t be bothered attitude to the daily nuances of life..Want to relax and take things easy rather than do things around the house.
1,15758,4035,15646,I become irritable, (more than normal), tired, angry frustrated aggressive.
1,15759,4030,15648,Not listening to their points of view or instructions.  Not taking an interest in what they may have to say or have on their minds.
1,15760,4033,15648,Moan,moan and more moans i tend to tick like a cheap watch.
1,15761,4044,15648,I dont, too good at managing it to show anybody else.
1,15762,4028,15645,The loss of morale and the thought &quot;Well why should i give a toss!&quot;.
1,15763,4029,15648,Being critical of others. Highlighting their weaknesses. Constantly complaining. Doing only what absolutly has to be done.
1,15764,4033,15761,your great
1,15765,4043,15647,Argue or look for time alone to avoid arguements.
1,15766,4044,15648,Silent treatment
1,15767,4037,15647,Clearly I try not to but since becoming a Police Officer I have noticed i now have a short temper
1,15768,4028,15645,We are normally an afterthought, way down on the pecking order in comparisson to CID officers.
1,15769,4029,15648,Bad stress only comes out from workplace issues, rarely &#039;stressfull&#039; operational situations.
1,15770,4044,15763,highlighting others weakness is a sign of your own, deflecting it onto someone else, thats not good.
1,15771,4037,15648,quiet and keep to myself
1,15772,4036,15722,an example of how these are geared for management, one inspector who is no longer in the department made a mistake and gave himself a negative PDP4 and then gave himself a positive PDP4 for recognising his failings and issuing himself with a negative one  !!!!!
1,15773,4030,15649,The gym, which I use when permitted.  The main resource is talking it through with my peers which I generally do.
1,15774,4043,15649,Occupational Health, as yet not had to use them but can feel the need coming on.
1,15775,4033,15649,The OHU welfare team are there to be used.I tend to go to my family or close friends who are not in the job. The gym is also a good way of destressing.
1,15776,4029,15649,I have personal experience of the support system. I have found it largley based on &#039;how soon can you get back to work&#039; rather than&#039; whats gone wrong and how can we help fix it&#039;. It looks ok on paper, but fails to deliver. The practitioners in my experience were out of their depth ang going through the motions to satisfy policy.
1,15777,4037,15649,Occupational health but I do not know if I would use them. I would prefer to seek help from my GP
1,15778,4036,15649,the gym - do i use it -yes / and moaning - do i do it  - yes alot but there&#039;s alot to moan about
1,15779,4029,15775,The gym is good, but it it very dated and time to train is limited.
1,15780,4044,15649,If you show stress in this role you will be back to area before youre appointment with occy health is booked
1,15781,4043,15649,&quot;Away days&quot; with colleagues and organised by colleagues on rest days. These should be organised by the management team on work days and called Team building exercises just like they are in the private sector
1,15782,4028,15645,This is the one issue which annoys me the most, we want to do our job and do it well, despite all the problems in relation to P.I.s welfare issues, training issues, equipment issues I could go on and on. But when you know you could do this job a lot better if bosses put some effort into say updating intel in respect to criminals wanted at full response, we could be much more effective but i guess given out tickets is much more important!!!
1,15783,4036,15650,yes in the absence of anything else
1,15784,4029,15775,It is difficult to acknowledge &#039;stress&#039; in our role. It is seen as a weekness and could cause problems at  later time.
1,15785,4044,15650,No, how can they be impartial or confidential.
1,15786,4037,15656,strongly agree
1,15787,4033,15650,I have used the department once before and to be fair they where good. But to be totally honest I would now use the support from family, friends and my GP if required.
1,15788,4035,15647,On the whole, i try not to bring work home with me, but in doing this i dont talk to my wife about my job anymore as the politics and what the job has become, depresses me. She finds this distressing and is constantly telling me to leave and do a job were i would be valued. I do sometimes lose it at home and rant a lot, usually without much reason, I have a two year old son now, he keeps me sane.
1,15789,4044,15650,I would rather speak to somebody outside the job that I could trust, family or friends or my own GP
1,15790,4029,15650,No. I don&#039;t believe they are confidential or impartial. In fact after a shooting, they could be disclosable to an enquiry.
1,15791,4043,15650,I don&#039;t believe the Occ Health unit is as confidential as they make out and i&#039;m sure any issues would get back to management.
1,15792,4030,15650,I feel the Police do not really offer me any adequate way of dealing with stress, fortunately I have my own methods of dealing with stress by talking it out with friends and colleagues.  So I would not have the first idea how to utilise anything my job offered me or whether it would be of any use.
1,15793,4028,15646,Getting fed up, annoyed, angry, pissed off, both in work and more concerning at home. You know its happening but not so easy to stop it.
1,15794,4037,15789,agree
1,15795,4029,15650,I didn&#039;t find the practitioners particularly good or effective.
1,15796,4037,15791,strongly agree
1,15797,4038,15791,what makes you think there are confidentiality problems with OHU?
1,15798,4043,15641,Criminals found not guilty by Merseyside jurors and magistrates that are often made up of people that hate the Police, criminal justice system and have never worked a day in their miserable lives
1,15799,4033,15651,Making a wrong decision is the obvious one .Not being supported by colleagues or supervision when a decision is made.
1,15800,4036,15641,Poor standards of equipment mainly role related uniform  and condition of vehicles under normal circumstances you wouldnt get me near one of those cars
1,15801,4028,15647,Try my best not to but am human and yes it happens. Just get short tempered or just want to sit down and do nothing? Find it hard because dont want to bring work home and talk about it but guess i need to.
1,15802,4035,15648,Moaning and ranting and talking about how it was in my last Force, i know this must be very boring to hear over and over again, but I dont care, makes me feel good. even though i know it is probably as shit there now as it is here now, rose tinted glasses and all that.<br />excessive piss taking just for sport.
1,15803,4044,15651,People within Firearms are most definatley far to self opinionated this can sometimes be stressful however its good to listen to how others may deal with an incident as long as they are prepared to accept their way is not the only way.
1,15804,4028,15648,Moan, moan,and moan some more or bite me tounge and say nothing.
1,15805,4029,15651,The number of steps I then have to take to justify what I have done. In some cases the red tape that follows. The thought of having to justify myself to any number of other people who are not as well trained, well informed or experienced, although senior in rank. A simple decision can become a major issue simply because of the current politics.
1,15806,4037,15651,Decisions that are not supported by mangement - usually people who have not worked the streets in years and lost touch with reality
1,15807,4038,15799,what constitutes a wrong decision?  Personal consequences etc...
1,15808,4030,15651,That it is your own decision based on your own moral standing and knowledge of the law.  You will not be supported in anyway by the Police, who would prefer to sack a Police officer making a bad decision with the best heart felt intentions, with an inpeccable record then fail to employ a physically incapable, morally unacceptable person who forfills the home offices critera for the type of person who should be encouraged to join the police.
1,15809,4029,15805,The possible sanctions if somebody disagrees with me.
1,15810,4035,15649,Canteen, Gym, prayer room apparently, but havnt found it yet. canteen alot, Gym very rarely, prefare to leave work at earliest opportunity.
1,15811,4030,15808,Sorry impeccable was spelt wrongly
1,15812,4029,15651,Making sure all those it effects are aware of the decision.
1,15813,4033,15799,When you have made a decision in good faith and for whatever reason it has gone wrong. I get angry with myself blaming myself when realistically it could be any number of factors that caused it to go pear shaped
1,15814,4028,15649,Moaning to work mates and the gym are the best resources. OHU are there and well intentioned but could never see me them using them as they cannot be trusted, it is only confidentional to a certain point, which they decide on, and i fear what effect it would have on my career.
1,15815,4038,15651,Can you define a wrong/bad decision?
1,15816,4043,15651,Knowing a criminal has got away with something because of my bad judgement or decision, however i&#039;m getting to the stage where i don&#039;t really care because the justice system is a waste of time and a lack of appropriate sentances given out makes the hard work put in by officers a waste of time.
1,15817,4028,15650,No nothing inside the job can ever be fully trusted which is sad but true.
1,15818,4033,15695,majorly agree
1,15819,4037,15803,agree
1,15820,4036,15651,knowing there is always another way it could be done and which way is best is determined by so many &#039;what ifs&#039;. - there will always be a better way with hind sight (at the trial)
1,15821,4029,15651,The constant feeling that it will be scruitinised by other people, not in a supportive way, but to ensure it doesn&#039;t cost money, or doesnt offend senior officers, or is appropriate for the political climate.
1,15822,4044,15815,When a witness is promised the earth for a sanction detection, their never going to get what was promised by others just to clear up a crime
1,15823,4043,15815,a decision taken that results in an unfavourable outcome at an incident.
1,15824,4029,15815,a decision made for the wrong reasons. ie to manipulate figures or an individual using it to make a point.
1,15825,4036,15815,bad wrong decision (FIMs)- sending unarmed officers to deal with offenders armed with knives
1,15826,4033,15815,A wrong decision is something that has gone wrong because of  an external parameter, a bad decision is a decision that has been made without taking into account other factors or seeking the opinions of others....
1,15827,4035,15650,Seats not to comfy, but other than that facilitys at the nick ok.<br />I would sooner open a vain, than go to any Police organisation for help, if i required more than a pint with the lads and a bit of a chat I would go private.<br />This comes from needing help and being refused on the grounds of budget, nothing in my opinon should come before the health and welfare of the officers because without them, THERE IS NO FORCE.
1,15828,4043,15652,Stronger management at all levels that are willing to support staff when decisions are made that result in a complaint/internal investigation.
1,15829,4028,15651,The implications of your choice being wrong or badly wrong, which although made in good faith, on the information you had at the time, and in a timescale which could be seconds, will be judged by colleagues, managers, the IPCC, C&amp;D and the courts over the next several years and could lead to jail.
1,15830,4029,15652,To be managed by like-minded specialists who know the job I do because they have done it and aren&#039;t there to impose the will of ACPO and protect their next promotion.
1,15831,4037,15803,The fact that a Police Officers discresion is being taken away with performance indicators being pushed more and more means that you can feel uncomfortable doing your job as you are being forced to deal with the public in a way you would not normally do
1,15832,4044,15652,A command structure that spends more time concerned with their staffs wellbeing and progress than getting their next pip
1,15833,4036,15815,lets be honest we make mistakes but with the best of intentions, no one is perfect, if no one is hurt we just dont want to to be hung out to dry as an example of accounability or management getting another tick in their kalamazoo
1,15834,4029,15652,To be in a more pleasent working environment with more down time, training facilities and not being constantly pestered for meaningless perfomance figures.
1,15835,4029,15652,Being allowed to make decisions and being properly supported.
1,15836,4035,15651,Self doubt, as to wether you have made the right decisision in a split second, that will be judged by so called experts, at a later date and for some considerable time.<br />Also if my decision and subsequent action was measured and just, or a way of venting my frustration.
1,15837,4037,15651,The fact that a Police Officers discresion is being taken away with performance indicators being pushed more and more means that you can feel uncomfortable doing your job as you are being forced to deal with the public in a way you would not normally do
1,15838,4029,15652,Better quality training facilities and equyipment.
1,15839,4033,15652,You are never going to reduce stress at work.Even if you could people would bring their out of work problems into work and thus feel stressed at work. Ideally people should be made to feel worthwhile at work.  If issues out of work are causing you stress then the organisation should offer support and importantly give you compassionate time off work, this job wants you back ASAP rather than letting the problem get sorted..Rocket science it aint.
1,15840,4043,15652,Support from ACPO ranks especially when it comes to reports in the press. ACPO should be standing up and speaking out in support of officers instead of taking a position on the fence and being too worried about political fall out from their comments.
1,15841,4036,15652,Bosses with backbone, supporting the depatrment and making it what it could be instead of using it to feather their own nest for promotion
1,15842,4030,15815,A bad decision defined by myself is one where a criminal is allowed to keep breaching the law and making peoples lives uncomfortable, despite the polices actions or in-actions.<br />A bad decision defined by the Police and the criminal justice system is one which does not pander to the human rights of the disadvantaged criminal who has always been a victim in this hard cruel capatilist state.<br />A wrong decision is one which is made and allows the victims of crime to remain at risk and puts further parties such as unarmed Police officers at risk because some policy or cooking of the books dictates that the type of crime that is occuring should not be recorded and dealt with in the correct way, ie sending unarmed police to an incident where a male may have a gun to see if it is infact and air rifle!!!!
1,15843,4044,15652,Recognition for the role that we perform, more money would definately make me feel less stressed!
1,15844,4033,15830,I totally agree.
1,15845,4028,15803,Sorry i strongly disagree with this i think you would find this character trait in any demanding, streesful job. Yes you will have strong characters but i dont think you should misjudge confindence or experience with being self important or self opinionated. We should also be careful when we judge or colleagues actions as other than people who directly dealt with an incident can ever know fully why they did what they did.
1,15846,4030,15652,A completetly independant support unit that you can consult and utilise without knowledge or permission of anybody in the Police
1,15847,4036,15723,immunity from prosection !
1,15848,4043,15652,A move away from the current management teams thinking of &quot;Them and Us&quot;.
1,15849,4044,15723,Have time off with my family without needing a begging letter.
1,15850,4044,15723,no drug testing
1,15851,4043,15723,A criminal justice system more likened to the of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;
1,15852,4036,15850,why ?
1,15853,4033,15723,I would definately give us a pay rise.Considering what we do we are underpaid, FACT. Lots of leave, more resources, better equipment and to be made to feel worthwhile and some bottled water please.
1,15854,4036,15850,a softer shirt
1,15855,4033,15852,We should be trusted, where is the suspicion?
1,15856,4036,15723,a softer shirt
1,15857,4033,15854,Made by a saville row tailor, Gieves and Hawkes would do very nicely.
1,15858,4028,15652,Support from managers who dont resent the job we do or the moaning we do about the job, maybe one day we will have bosses who actually know what they are doing, who have actually done our job and have some empathy with our conerns. We colud even have a boss who instead of being there for thier own advancment wants to actually improve the dept and stay long enough to see those improvments through, BUT I THINK NOT!!!
1,15859,4029,15856,Concentrate on our specialism. Be better resourced in all ways. Be rewarded in line with the sacrifices we make in order to do our job; more money; more leave; real welfare support for ourselves and our families. Meaningful reward and recognition. Wide ranging private health care.
1,15860,4044,15726,I COULD NOT POSSIBLY TYPE THAT!!!
1,15861,4033,15726,You have a very professional deaprtment. Use it properly and respect the highly trained officers you have in it..amen
1,15862,4029,15856,Proper tactical clothing to carry out the role, to be warn at all times.
1,15863,4030,15723,If somebody had been arrested and convicted three times of a serious offences their human rights would be resticted because they clearly have no respect for others.  These restrictions would inslude constant electronic tagging a redustion in benefits, a curfew and having to present themselves to the police on request.<br />I would restict benefits which currently is breeding a criminal class.<br />Give the Police powers of detention, search and entry which reflects the urgency  and necessity to keep criminals from dictating to their community and suppressing their neighbourhoods
1,15864,4036,15726,give us the funding required to do our job effectivley
1,15865,4044,15726,Get out on the ground and see what its really like, bet you cant do Niche
1,15866,4037,15854,More powers regarding stop search. If you have nothing to hide whats the problem
1,15867,4036,15726,You&#039;re great, can i have a raise ?
1,15868,4035,15652,Stress is good, if its measured and is there for the right reason, ie a firearms situation, all i need is the equipment to train to do my job and the tools to do my job without having to beg other departments to lend me a car, this is 2007.<br />management that when ordering equipment for staff do so without all the bollocks that takes three years to get anything and when it finally arives we are not allowed to use it because of a policy written by a civillian who has nevr responded to an emergency in there life.
1,15869,4037,15723,More powers regarding stop search. If you have nothing to hide whats the problem
1,15870,4043,15723,Harsher sentances including the death sentance and the chance to rid Merseyside of the no hopers that walk the streets in &quot;Low Alpines&quot; that take take take and will never give anything back to society.
1,15871,4028,15723,reverse roles with bosses for a while see if changes thier approach to constables in the dept and our concerns.<br />In fact sod it think some of them are beyond saving
1,15872,4029,15863,Lets get back to our role of the thin blue line seperating the criminals from the good people. Lets stop trying to be instrumental in everyone playing happy families.
1,15873,4044,15726,Be proud of the Dept. and recognise the work the officers do for no extra other than their sanity.
1,15874,4029,15861,|This is vital!
1,15875,4044,15726,you hang on in there youre doing a great job
1,15876,4030,15726,People should join the police to fight crime, if their not interested and just want to carry out clerical roles they should no longer be police and should be employed as an offic worker.  Why do you need to be payed &pound;30,000 to scan documents onto IMS.   Police beaurocracy should be cut to ensure officers are on the street forfilling their potential as crime fighters.
1,15877,4035,15723,Power to take the law into my own hands, literally and rid the city, I love, of the rats and wasters with there hands out demanding and stealing what they DESERVE, MY ARSE.
1,15878,4028,15726,You fucking losers!!!! get a grip come back to this planet and help us do our jobs instead of bum chuming with the press making yourselve look great.
1,15879,4037,15726,Do not surround yourselves with YES people
1,15880,4044,15726,Remember us when your in your warm shiny office and were buried in a back garden at three in the morning in the middle of winter without the correct clothing to keep us warm and dry.
1,15881,4028,15656,i agree
1,15882,4029,15861,Give us what we deserve. Stop being sheep and playing at &#039;Merseyside Police PLC&#039;. Be prepared to make individual decisions and stop playing politics. We are supposed to be independant of Government.
1,15883,4043,15726,Six weeks on the streets with a section of officers would give them a view of what policing is about.
1,15884,4035,15877,Magistrates and Judges would believe that are way is the right and just way
1,15885,4044,15726,Let us do the job we are trained for.
1,15886,4043,15726,You do a great job and I hope my degree assists me to get to your rank one day so I can make a difference too.
1,15887,4028,15641,Short notice enforced overtime at the end or start of a shift with no regard to the impact it has on your family life. The poor sargeants are left to sort it out and that results in being told you will do even if you cant.
1,15888,4044,15726,YOU ARE MY MOTIVATION FOR PROMOTION!
1,15889,4044,15878,Inappropriate, shows us in a bad light
1,15890,4044,15882,could&#039;nt agree more
1,15891,4035,15726,Have the faith to trust the highly trained and motivated officers you have at your disposal, and use us to target the criminals that we want to be targeting instead of wasting tax payers money issuing fix penalties and stop forms to kids. Matrix has failed as far a i am concerned we were sold a perfect picture and told we would be in the intelligence loop there would be no us and them in relation to the CID, this has never happened we are still the poor relation and feel like we are not trusted.
1,15892,4043,15878,Obviously an officer unable to express themselves in the appropriate manner, perhaps one with inadequate schooling.
1,15893,4029,15653,Welfare and development of my children.
1,15894,4033,15653,When something is on my mind at home like if i have to pick the kids up and i arrest near to end of the shift i have to then make child care plan etc. Get grief when i cant get the leave or days off to suit family or holiday commitments.
1,15895,4029,15654,Irratic hours, which prevent me carrying out family responsibilities.  Ongoing problems that play on my mind and prevent me from being fully involved in family matters.
1,15896,4033,15654,Working enforced overtime or having rest days cancelled when the family have something planned.This causes stress within the family relationship.
1,15897,4044,15653,WHEN A CHILD IS ILL AND I HAVE TO LEAVE THEM TO GO TO WORK.
1,15898,4044,15654,WHEN I CANT HAVE TIME OFF FOR A FAMILY HOLIDAY OR IMPORTANT OCCASSION. ETC PARENTS EVENING, XMAS NATIVITY, BIRTHDAYS.
1,15899,4036,15653,None, its the other way around
1,15900,4043,15653,my relationships with family friends out of the job.
1,15901,4030,15653,When shifts don&#039;t marry up with my girlfriend and when shifts are changed and extended at short notice.  These affect my comfort at home and it makes me resent work
1,15902,4036,15654,Free time, tiredness, shift compatability with wife, being called out in the middle of the night
1,15903,4043,15653,state of my personal finances
1,15904,4029,15654,Lack of resources and flexibility to allow time off.
1,15905,4030,15654,Courses and studying for certain things I want at work, makes me neglect my partners and my own interests
1,15906,4043,15654,shifts and the way the management want you to drop everything and put work first. Being called into work at the drop of a hat with no thought of the affect on your family.
1,15907,4035,15654,Shifts and short notice changes of duty affect my wife and her buisness and my time with my son. Inability to take annual leave when you need it because of the requirements of the service.<br />My wife is a successfull buisness woman who has to arrange her meetings and travelling around my shifts, The Police service does not consider or assist with your partners working arrangements.
1,15908,4035,15653,I am fortunate to have an understanding wife who has allowed me to follow whatever route within the Police i have chosen. However i am not being allowed to progress my career further in my department because i am not willing to sacrifice my family life further by going on call.

1,15940,4065,15930,fruit and nut??<br />No....plain
1,15941,4057,15922,i don&#039;t like dark chocolate
1,15942,4066,15929,i think it sux
1,15943,4059,15926,I dont like nuts :-)
1,15944,4060,15918,too american!!
1,15945,4061,15918,what even is this??
1,15946,4054,15926,I totally disagree, chocolate and nuts do not go together
1,15947,4053,15922,too bitter!
1,15948,4066,15909,more orientation... i did get it
1,15949,4064,15909,I expected a lot more supervision.  No these expectations were anything but met
1,15950,4065,15909,I expected the course as advertised to be a full-time intensive course- not 2days a week.
1,15951,4063,15909,the proffesional study of &quot;criminal profiling&quot;<br />On the web
1,15952,4061,15909,its not quite what i expected. The content and the way it was taught was less involved than undergrad. We were not given as much help as i thought we would. In reflection im a little disappointed.
1,15953,4065,15909,I expected a lot more &#039;teaching&#039; would be involved since it is a &#039;taught&#039; msc
1,15954,4065,15909,i expected contact with ongoing investigations as advertised
1,15955,4073,15909,I expected to study the criminal mind and how to become a competent researcher and investigative psychologist.  I do think that my expectations were met and i am now able to conduct research using new  statitical techniques.
1,15956,4054,15909,I expected the course to be full time in terms of taught material. I think it has been almost completely independant study in which I am happy to do but I think content wise, there could have been a lot more taught lectures as I believe were in previous years
1,15957,4066,15909,I was expecting more assistance, more interaction with the professor... Organized lectures which are not set up last min. Overall, I found it interesting and challenging as I first thought.Only if we had more help especially during the begining of the year would ease our stress
1,15958,4061,15909,i was thinking of learning from the boss and being taught to become more expert in the area, i am disappointed!
1,15959,4065,15909,i expected a lot more supervision than we received to help guide us
1,15960,4065,15909,i expected a more supportive framework
1,15961,4056,15909,that it would be well organized and that the students would  be offered support by the staff. this has proved not to be the case it is highly disorganized and i feel that there is difficult to get a member of staff to answer queries.
1,15962,4054,15909,I expected there to be alot more supervision.
1,15963,4066,15948,more orientation... and i did not get it
1,15964,4069,15909,understanding real investigation and academic, how academic part can apply to real investigation.
1,15965,4060,15909,I expected to get more input from staff in the early stages of writing reports. This was not adhered to and I felt like we were putting staff out by asking for help.<br />I did enjoy all subject areas covered on the course but would have liked more depth to each.
1,15966,4057,15909,I expected the course to be full time involving quite a lot of teaching and group work. I expected within these teaching sessions to meet with staff who would provide advice and facilitate open discussion would take place. not all of this was met
1,15967,4053,15909,I did not expect to be spoon-fed in terms of tuition received, but at the same time I did expect to receive enough help to enable me to come out of the year with the ability to use the material I&#039;ve been taught in the real world. Unfortunately I feel at this stage that this expectation has not been met.
1,15968,4058,15909,I expected a more in-depth look into specific aspects of Investigative Psychology and their practical applications. Unfortunately, the lectures have mostly focused on covering the theory, but fell short of showing a pratical aspect of every single subject.  In addition, I expected more lecurers who were more prepared to speak and enjoyed teaching.
1,15969,4052,15909,originally i expected i would learn how to make profiling of serial offenders<br />but, rather what i learned is mostly about how offenders think, act, make their crimes<br />even though i didn&#039;t learn exactly what i expected, I am very happy with what i am taught<br />I think, what i learned could be basis for making some inference about offenders&#039; activities<br />one thing i feel sorry for is that it needs to be more organized
1,15970,4059,15909,I expected to be given a free-ish reign in relation to the subjects I could consider for each of my assignments. Yet the topics that I was interested in, and hence proposed studies for, were sometimes disregarded &amp; I was told to find something else to do. I also expected to receive a lot more guidance than what was given. I feel like we were thrown in at the deep end &amp; left to sink or swim. I didnt expect there to be no supervisor help.
1,15971,4062,15909,I expected this course to give me a clear, detailed and empirical account of the many types of crimes and criminal actions that have been studied.  I also expected that the class time would be very intensive and I would gain as much knowledge from as many sources as possible. While we did have the opportunity to gain knowledge from many sources in this field, I did not find the once class a week very intensive, and as such feel I could have gained more from this course
1,15972,4053,15963,me niether
1,15973,4073,15955,Although i don&#039;t feel that we had enough teaching or supervision.
1,15974,4066,15955,i did not
1,15975,4065,15958,i agree
1,15976,4058,15948,Sadly I felt that orientation was the one thing that this course lacked the most.
1,15977,4065,15964,contact with real ongoing investigations would have been extremely helpful!
1,15978,4066,15950,i dont think i would handle 5 times a week, then we wouldnt have time to deal with other stuff.. i would prefer if it was slighlty more intensive tho
1,15979,4053,15950,I fully agree with that. Infact I really cannot understand why this course is the most expensive MSc to do considering how little we have been in and the lack of supervision
1,15980,4056,15954,i don t think that students can expected to be privvy to ongoing police investigations
1,15981,4062,15956,I absolutely agree with this....I feel as though previous years were able to get more from this course than we were
1,15982,4060,15961,Completely agreed!!
1,15983,4057,15967,i totally agree
1,15984,4059,15953,I agree, this year has been more of a &#039;research&#039; msc than a taught one
1,15985,4069,15959,i expected a more supervison too.
1,15986,4066,15961,ME TOO...
1,15987,4054,15956,I think it has been useful to carry out research on our own and do feel I am a little better at conducting reserach although, the feedback that was received could have been prevented if supervision was given throughout the assignments
1,15988,4073,15958,i thought that we might have found out about investigations that the department are currently working on and how they go about it.
1,15989,4058,15950,If the two days had been approached more effectively then it would have been a great course with the additional days to research.
1,15990,4052,15968,it looks like everybody expected the same
1,15991,4065,15910,The course should be much better organised
1,15992,4061,15910,much more interaction with the staff
1,15993,4065,15910,...and much better structured
1,15994,4065,15910,supervisors should be allocated for each assignment
1,15995,4058,15910,Lecturers who enjoy teaching, happy to impart their knowledge to the hungry minds in the class.
1,15996,4061,15910,being told its ok to appraoch staff for help - learning more about their individual areas of work.
1,15997,4054,15910,Definately supervision throughout assignmnents. It is very stressful to conduct research if you lack experience. I think many people would benefit from a supervisors input
1,15998,4064,15910,An improvement would be to allocate all the msc students with a supervisor.
1,15999,4065,15910,e-mails and coursework should be returned asap
1,16000,4057,15910,I would recommend that the course involved more teaching sessions and supervision to make people feel they are getting what they came for
1,16001,4056,15910,each student should be allocated a supervisor at the beginning of the course ,someone they could seek advice and clarification about the assignments.
1,16002,4062,15910,More class time, delving deeper into each topic and each type of geographical and statistical research and analysis so as to have a better understanding of the programs and how they work, having supervisors to help us with our assignments
1,16003,4069,15910,more supervison and more activity works can be improve the course.
1,16004,4053,15910,More input from staff, especially the programme director. I feel as though we have been floating along without any constructive criticism and especially no encouragement.
1,16005,4065,15910,there should be alot more teaching involved
1,16006,4064,15910,More organization of the case in terms of assignments and supervisors
1,16007,4056,15910,course should be better organized too many timetable changes cause problems
1,16008,4073,15910,It would be improved with more teaching time.  Easier access to lecturers to help with statistics and projects.  Finding out what the department is doing at the moment - how does investigative psychology help organisations??
1,16009,4052,15910,introducing a more real case to our class would be desirable<br />but, not much sure about that<br />because without basic, theoretical knowledge on offenders&#039; behaviours, being open to real cases&#039;r profiling would be simply very risky
1,16010,4065,15910,the prospectus should reflect the actual content of the course
1,16011,4058,15910,A more encouraging and engaging attitude from lectures in regard to specific subjects or topics tackled by the students, in order to further develop good ideas.
1,16012,4063,15910,I recommend that the assignment feedbacks have to be given more quicqly
1,16013,4060,15910,To have supervisors for all assignments. More guidance with regards to what areas to research in preparation for exams.
1,16014,4069,15910,more interaction to academic and real investigation
1,16015,4073,15910,A lot more help with statistics!
1,16016,4066,15910,- Available staff to help us<br />- Shouldnt have a hard time gaining data<br />- sticking to ONE timetable and not changing constantly thorough the year<br />- Better teaching of stats/research methods classes (i.e. indipendant small assignments to do at home where we get marked on)<br />- We were too time pressured first 2 weeks of uni.
1,16017,4053,15910,I think there were too many people enrolled on the course this year- prevented any real chance of one to one interaction
1,16018,4059,15910,More contact with the department in the form of more classes, although not 5 days a week, but maybe 3/4 full days instead of 1 and a half days that we had.
1,16019,4059,15910,More supervision and guidance in relation to assignments. It turned out the the Critical Incident department were far more helpful and far more approachable &amp; willing to help.
1,16020,4073,15910,coursework to be returned quicker
1,16021,4052,15991,more supervision is necessary
1,16022,4066,16012,i totally agree
1,16023,4053,16015,I disagree with this. In my opinion, statistics was the only thing covered in sufficient detail.
1,16024,4073,15910,More knowlege about what data is available
1,16025,4056,15999,the feedback on the assignments  should be legible
1,16026,4057,16000,supervisors should be given from the start who can provide advice and assistance from the beginning on areas that each student is interested in researching
1,16027,4062,15999,The prompt return of assignments is definately lacking, as many of us were not able to get feedback from our previous papers and determine our mistakes before having to hand in the next project
1,16028,4052,15992,especially for foreign students<br />is it too much expectation?
1,16029,4058,16000,If the two days were used more effectively the amount of days should not matter.  The other days should be there to go in more depth with subjects at hand.
1,16030,4060,15910,While there are a few staff I have contacted that are very good at replying to emails, there have been a few times when I have asked important and reasonable questions and still to this day have recieved no answer.
1,16031,4063,15999,In order to improve this, the course need more supervisor.
1,16032,4066,16012,we should have this feedback during the all the course
1,16033,4059,16020,Definitely, 7 weeks to be returned is far too long &amp; usually overruns the next assignment deadline
1,16034,4061,16004,there definately hasnt been enough encouragement - it actually feels like weve been put down and put off - especailly applying for PhDs.
1,16035,4073,15910,more teaching time for the money and being taught by Professor Canter more
1,16036,4059,16017,I agree, 20 people is too big a class for any of us to gain enough from this course
1,16037,4066,15910,although given supervisor for 4th assignment some did not benefit as much as others
1,16038,4057,16029,yes but two days is not full time and more areas of use could be covered throughout a whole weeks teaching
1,16039,4061,16006,it would be better if we could perhaps choose to work with different people through the assignment to learn from each of the supervisor
1,16040,4065,16034,i definitely agree with this - not much help or support offered for finding funding
1,16041,4053,16024,Yes I agree, but also we should be told the correct way in which we go about retrieving data, and not just told &quot;you cant do that&quot;- why not? why cant we &quot;do that&quot;?
1,16042,4056,15999,members of staff should endeavour to answer emails promptly or at all, it is very frustrating to email staff and receive no reply
1,16043,4069,16012,yes i agree
1,16044,4066,15910,we should trade with more respect sometimes if we make some mistakes
1,16045,4059,15999,A lot of us had emails ignored by some of the IP department. This does not help or encourage us to perservere with the course
1,16046,4052,16024,exactly, we encountered a lot of difficulites in getting data. so need to be told about what kind of data is necessary with what properties<br />indeed, it is students&#039; responsiblity to get data for their own study
1,16047,4057,16005,i agree there more teaching is needed to have a deeper understanding of the topics covered
1,16048,4062,15999,While statistics may not have been many students strong points, I believe that more class time and exercises to help us understand the statistics topics and programs with guidance and not on our own time would have in the end saved us time, aggrevation, and energy
1,16049,4063,16015,There is much difference between people who have studyed statistc before this course and not
1,16050,4059,16010,I agree, the course isn&#039;t what it&#039;s advertised to be
1,16051,4073,15910,more indepth feedback on assignments
1,16052,4057,16008,yes i think this would be of great use and students could get involved in current research projects
1,16053,4066,16020,I agree, we did not know what we were doing wrong because of this
1,16054,4053,15910,The first 2 weeks consisted mainly presentations. That is fine and I can see why this was done. But there wasn&#039;t enough feedback/ tuition after each presentation. We wree just told that some of them weren&#039;t good enough. Future years could benefit from more encouragement/criticism.
1,16055,4065,16034,it seems to be that a student will do much better if he/she gets in with the right lecturer. This is not giving everyone the same opportunity to progress as it is merely down to chance
1,16056,4066,16020,better corrections in the assignments
1,16057,4073,15910,Be able to meet the person who marked assignment to discuss faults
1,16058,4054,16008,I think the stats classes on a wednesday should be more constructed around statistical procedures that we are likely to use. Alot of the advanced methods with Stacey this year have not been used for peoples assignmnents. Only logistic regression. It may be more useful to realise specifically in what context we could use them rather than just learning the technique
1,16059,4059,16015,I think the second semester statistics classes were covered a lot better &amp; in more detail. They were also broken down into more digestable chunks, understandable for even non-stats people. The teaching of stats in the first semester seemed half-hearted &amp; didn&#039;t really explain the theories &amp; methods properly
1,16060,4052,16014,real intestigation is mostly involved with a lot complicated things and most cases are solved simply by something else other than what we learned here<br />yesterday, a retired police officer told us &#039;cellular phone&#039; is usefully used for solving serial cases
1,16061,4060,16036,Totally, I think most of us weren&#039;t even wanted which has caused staff to give up trying. I think in a way we have been an experimental year. It&#039;s as if because there are so many of us, staff have decided to try the &#039;minimum guidance&#039; approach and see how we do with it.
1,16062,4056,16004,after an initial burst of enthusiasm at the beginning the programme director appeared to disappear and take no further part in the course, he seems unavailable and does not answer emails. in this case someone else should be appointed to deal with administrative matters if he is too busy.
1,16063,4059,16054,Definitely, we were completely shot down in the first 2 weeks...a reason why we&#039;ve been so quiet in class since
1,16064,4065,16010,- it advertised contact with ongoing investigations which we did not really have
1,16065,4057,16010,the prospectus made me feel as if i would in uni full time being taught and participating in research projects in groups not just independently. I think it needs to be clear most work is research on your own
1,16066,4066,16010,I think we are pretty mature enough to come to lectures whenever we want. We should not sign a papet of attendance. I mean, if i miss a lecture it&#039;s my own problem isn&#039;t it. It will hurt my grades. Why be treated like a kid and confronted if we do not show up
1,16067,4063,16020,yes, we need feedback before conducting next assignment.
1,16068,4054,16015,I think it would be useful to see the context in which we could use stats methods rather than just learning the technique and just learning to run them through spss
1,16069,4052,16013,yes, sometimes too little comment makes me really perplexed<br />so necessary for asking those comments on my assignment. but not easy to contact him even by email
1,16070,4060,16019,I agree and it&#039;s a shame that the view is that they are not directly related to IP.
1,16071,4066,16044,I think we are pretty mature enough to come to lectures whenever we want. We should not sign a papet of attendance. I mean, if i miss a lecture it&#039;s my own problem isn&#039;t it. It will hurt my grades. Why be treated like a kid and confronted if we do not show up
1,16072,4073,16035,Haven&#039;t seem him since last semester
1,16073,4061,16005,at least not always being refer: go to read this article or this book
1,16074,4053,16035,Perhaps not more teaching from him, but it would have been better if he was more involved in the course as opposed to never being in the department. Afterall it is his course that we are paying for.
1,16075,4056,16015,the stats classes should be taught in smaller groups this would help teaching
1,16076,4059,16061,Yes I feel like we&#039;ve been guinea pigs as we&#039;ve found out that previous years students received a completely different format of teaching &amp; guidance
1,16077,4058,16036,The problem is that allowing 20 people on the course and then taking an approach of little supervision and no guidance, is surely detriment against everybody.
1,16078,4066,16057,canter
1,16079,4073,16057,everyone
1,16080,4066,16057,canter
1,16081,4054,16059,I disagree, I think the pHd students tried there best
1,16082,4066,16057,canter
1,16083,4065,16018,more forensic psychology teaching content would be relevant to prepare us for future jobs. I know it is not a &#039;forensic psychology&#039; course bu more knowledge about the wider field would be useful
1,16084,4066,16057,david
1,16085,4052,15994,yea, that is a good idea
1,16086,4073,16035,it would be really interesting to find out the type of work that Professor canter is working on when we don&#039;t see him to help us get some idea for the future
1,16087,4065,16035,extremely expensive course and not value for money... see all other points
1,16088,4060,16030,In particular Prof Canter. It would be an idea if staff could make it clear when they won&#039;t be around for long periods of time including PhD students so we know not to expect any emails back.
1,16089,4061,15910,the department seems very split - IP and the critical incident department do not seem to get on and this can put people off talking to lecs on &#039;the other side&#039; depending on who their supervisor is.
1,16090,4053,16044,The need to sign a register should not be enforced- we are mature adults paying for the course- surely it is up to us whether we attend or not? We are mature enough to realsie how important it is to attend so if we dont, it is our responsibility
1,16091,4066,15911,the guy yesterday, porter, hammond

1,16112,4058,15911,Ben Baughman was the best

1,16114,4053,15911,1) Stuart Kirby<br />2)Alan Kirby<br />3)Rupert Heritage
1,16115,4065,16096,all three were good speakers, engaging
1,16116,4056,16102,kevin was entertaining and his talk may be useful regarding a career
1,16117,4057,16105,The task was entertaining and gave us an idea of what managing an incident would be like
1,16118,4064,16107,Simon Duff Clinical aspects of his area and dry sense of humour kept it humorous
1,16119,4061,16097,he mixed theory with practise ang gave us real examples that we will be able to use later
1,16120,4058,16104,Despite driving some of the students mad beyond any acceptable stress-level, it was very interactive and insightful.
1,16121,4066,16113,he is a joker
1,16122,4062,16111,Simon Duff kept things very interesting, was funny, gave us information we didn&#039;t know before
1,16123,4052,16100,rupert heritage, it is simply honor to meet him and listen to his experience
1,16124,4054,16105,Robbie was quite entertaining, very easy to listen to and informative about what they actually do as a job
1,16125,4064,16107,Louise Roper-again clincical aspects very interesting
1,16126,4065,16108,Simon duff was also very good - injected a lot of humour into his teaching
1,16127,4058,16119,AMEN
1,16128,4054,16112,Totally disagree.
1,16129,4056,16102,rupert used his examples from his police career which made the lecture interesting
1,16130,4062,16104,Robbie pushed us to think outside the box and help us to see the difficulties in extreme scenarios that police may have to deal with
1,16131,4053,16114,Stuart Kirby was a good example of how Investigative Psychology can be used in the police- a career I very much want to take part in<br />The same can be said for Alan Kirby
1,16132,4053,16112,Dont waste me time
1,16133,4064,16107,Kate Whitfield-gave a good informed lecture and opened my eyes up to the other side of Critical Incidents as I was thinking about not turning up to that lecture but glad I did.
1,16134,4052,16091,but it would be better if he used some photos
1,16135,4063,16112,me neither
1,16136,4073,16094,1. rupert heritage was the most informative about how to use investigative psychology to help investigations.  How the anlayses that we have learnt can be used to help investigations.<br />2. Albert Kirkby gave a really good insight into police investigations.  Helps wanna be police officers.<br />3.  HYDRA is really interesting and it was presented really well - opens an area that can be helped with IP
1,16137,4066,16105,i want simon to be my supervisor
1,16138,4065,16115,gave us their insight and knowledge
1,16139,4066,16105,I would like Tony Montana
1,16140,4060,16100,Rupert was particularly good because he was very approachable, and communicated a very clear message about the applicablity of this course to real criminal investigations.
1,16141,4059,16111,Simon &amp; Rupert engaged us with humour &amp; both appeared to really know what they were talking about &amp; were passionate about their subject<br />Simon, Rupert &amp; Albert all used real-life examples &amp; showed us crime scenes, we were treated as equal adults
1,16142,4061,16114,robert roy hazelwood, gabrielle salfati, micky pistorius
1,16143,4059,16112,Rubbish
1,16144,4073,16094,Visiting speaker - Gabrielle Salfati.  I really like the work that she has done and i have tried to continue it this year.
1,16145,4066,16112,BS
1,16146,4073,16144,Adrain West
1,16147,4064,16107,I would have liked Bob Kepple to come and speak.  To give an overview of what the Investigative side of things is like in the states and what job opportunities are available world wide.
1,16148,4059,16114,Bob Keppel
1,16149,4076,15911,Prof. Alison - coinsidering that he never lectured this year, I am sure he would make a very good speaker.
1,16150,4065,16112,would have liked more visiting speakers who work as investigative psychologists
1,16151,4056,16102,paul brittain it would be could to get a different point of view
1,16152,4061,16142,Richard Kocsis, Jean Proulx
1,16153,4053,15911,I would like to hear from any of the top officers from the Metropolitan Police Force
1,16154,4057,16105,more visiting speakers who have done the course so we can see where it has lead them
1,16155,4054,16108,I would like to see more visiting speakers that have already done the MSc to find out what they are up to now etc with relevance to the course
1,16156,4054,16108,Craig Bennell
1,16157,4065,15911,more visiting speakers who are investigative psychologists
1,16158,4076,16107,Adrien West - seeing that he is quite well-know in the Investigate and Forensic area.
1,16159,4066,16150,me too
1,16160,4059,16112,Previous IP students would be a good vs...they can talk to us about their jobs, show us what can be applicable to IP
1,16161,4062,16098,West
1,16162,4076,15912,.....
1,16163,4061,15912,the mix of nationality within the class
1,16164,4065,15912,placement
1,16165,4064,15912,The other msc students
1,16166,4063,15912,will be placement...
1,16167,4053,15912,Getting the qualification at the end of the year
1,16168,4066,15912,????
1,16169,4062,15912,Having the ability to choose what topics we were most interested in for our assignments
1,16170,4076,16163,Very good point
1,16171,4059,16163,Definitely, the multicultural mix meant we could learn from each other
1,16172,4061,15912,the guest speakers - contact with people who use these techniques in their work
1,16173,4057,15912,It has been good to meet people from a variety of backgrounds
1,16174,4073,15912,Meeting Professor Canter and listening to his lectures
1,16175,4054,15912,The phd students have been invaluable just for the support and guidance that have been lacking. There input has been invaluable
1,16176,4062,15912,the mixed ethnicity to get a better understanding of crime and criminal investigations outside our Britain
1,16177,4066,15912,having to wake up at 9am to go to class
1,16178,4073,15912,Being able to meet the visiting speakers who do this type of work
1,16179,4065,15912,interesting content just not enough teaching
1,16180,4060,15912,Visiting Speakers and the practical aspects i.e. in homicide lecture. Team work stuff.
1,16181,4052,15912,I learned how to systematically approach offenders&#039; behaviours<br />especially from David and louise Porter
1,16182,4056,15912,small classes made learning easier, the visiting speakers who had completed the course were able to relate the course to the real world
1,16183,4069,15912,learn new analysis tech-SSA MSA
1,16184,4061,16157,People from CENTREX - SACAS or the BIA. Adam Gregory or Lee Rainbow?
1,16185,4053,15912,The variety of visiting speakers from all discuiplines of forensic/investigative psychology
1,16186,4073,15912,Meeting other students from all over the world
1,16187,4059,16169,I disagree, some of us were not given the option to choose our assignment topics &amp; were told by the course director what to do, despite having our own assignment/dissertation ideas in mind
1,16188,4066,16175,i think phd students were more helpful than actual lecturers
1,16189,4076,16165,Especially with all the problems we had during this year, it surely gaves us students enough reasons to meet in the Pub and share complaints and problems we&#039;ve had so far. Great and unorthodox group-bonding approach!
1,16190,4062,15912,The placement option - having the chance to get field experience in the area we wish to eventually work in
1,16191,4052,16183,yes, very interesting
1,16192,4062,15912,Guest speakers and the knowledge they brought to the classroom and to us
1,16193,4073,15912,learning new analyses eg SSA
1,16194,4053,16179,very well put!
1,16195,4063,16169,But, if I choose topic which is not supported by supervisour, I will lost my way...
1,16196,4057,16175,i agree it is their assistance that got us through our assignments
1,16197,4061,16177,later lecs def help us to engage more!
1,16198,4064,16181,Expand?
1,16199,4065,16166,once finally organised!
1,16200,4076,16183,Great to learn about these novel techniques, in the hope for them to become more established in the future!
1,16201,4056,16186,it was good to meet students from many different countries
1,16202,4059,16174,I disagree, other speakers have been much more engaging &amp; less derogatory
1,16203,4066,16183,im sure not everyone is property qualified to carry an ssa or msa. i mean we only had one lecture were the computers were breaking down. those who did not get the chance to use them on any assignment gained nothing out of those lectures
1,16204,4063,16187,every university has same problem...
1,16205,4073,15912,Having contact with police officers and understanding the work that they do
1,16206,4053,16175,Yes I agree, it&#039;s just a pity that we had to bug them because they are so busy with their own work. More supervisors needed. Surely the expensive fees could cover more supervisors saleries?
1,16207,4060,15912,That there is a good variety of interests explored by staff, allowing us a good opportunity to investigate different topics in our assignments...providing we get help that is!.. but the idea is there.
1,16208,4059,16175,Yes, the phds have been v.approachable
1,16209,4076,16179,It is not the amount that matters but the quality that matters.
1,16210,4059,16183,The worst thing was the slow computers we had to work on for stats
1,16211,4073,15913,Lynsay Birkett<br />Bringing new data into the department for others to use on Kidnap and ransom, serial killers past personal and criminal histories, gang behaviours and terrorist organisations and behaviours
1,16212,4061,15913,Lynne - hopefully getting some points of the other MSc&#039;s across in committee meetings! And passing on info where i could!
1,16213,4066,15913,Marilia : to my country I will probable contribute...i do not know in here
1,16214,4057,15913,Andrea Caddick- I have conducted two pieces of research that are to be used for publication and bringing in data from elsewhere

1,16219,4062,15913,Jean Biers<br />taking the information we have gained here back to Canada - contribute to my country<br />Give some people a good laugh over my accent and how i pronounce specific words (about!)
1,16220,4054,15913,Helen Cruickshanks- So far I have constructed a database from previous research that is now in a format for others to use in the archieve.
1,16221,4065,15913,Emma - hopefully my research and dissertation will be useful to other researchers.
1,16222,4060,15913,Laura Cataudo<br />Providing I get my data in the prisons for my dissertation, that would be some contribution?!!
1,16223,4053,15913,Michael Fusco- I contributed by spending day after day last year trying to make the course CD. Apologies for the incorrect hyperlinks!
1,16224,4069,15913,kyungha kim- i don;t see what i contribute. maybe data??
1,16225,4063,15913,Masahiro<br />Teach and Read Japanease.<br />Make class more happy!!!<br />I can teach some statistical methods and math to help your assignment.<br />Give Jpapanese police infromation.
1,16226,4059,15913,Robyn - contributing new data in relation to Kidnap &amp; Ransom across the world. Behaviourally distinguising between serial &amp; single rape.<br />Exploring a brand new area of research into murder context &amp; offender apprehension
1,16227,4054,16220,There will also be hopefully a new placement a Nottinghamshire police that I have organised for students in the future
1,16228,4076,15913,M. Humann - Contributed with a work-in-progress case-by-case serial murder database (Baughman &amp; Meade). Furthermore, hope to expand the research towards better comparative frameworks within specific areas, and hopefully cross-culturally.
1,16229,4052,15913,Jong-Gil Kim<br />I am afraid I don&#039;t make much contribution to this course<br />hopefully I like to link my experience to this field
1,16230,4066,16223,respect
1,16231,4076,15913,B Baughman - Hostage/Barricaded data and research for the centre.  Given an American cop perspective.  Will help bridge the gap between the two cultures in the future.

2,16241,4086,0,Do you feel that alumni should provide financial support to the institution? If yes, which areas do you think should be supported by these resources? If not, why not? How would you personally feel about being asked for money by the university?
2,16242,4086,0,Do you use the alumni website? What do you think of it? What are your thoughts on an e-newsletter and an online alumni community? If not, why not? If yes, how would you like to see it work? What would you like to gain from it? What (if anything) would you like to contribute?

1,16257,4109,16248,do you like them with cheese?
1,16258,4114,16248,what the heck is a bath oliver?
1,16259,4117,16248,Nice with cheese.  Family connections!!  Wonderfuil satisfying and really rare to get now too
1,16260,4112,16257,horrible
1,16261,4117,16248,I think I know who wrote that too.   They are really great with Stilton or Cheddar
1,16262,4112,16250,naughty
1,16263,4117,16253,Too hard - break your teeth so should be be banned
1,16264,4117,16254,Health advantages too but too much sugar - black and satin is really healthy
1,16265,4111,16250,Advanced pyschometrics reversed.
1,16266,4117,16250,Why on earth in bed - surely other things happen there?
1,16267,4110,16238,A degree!
1,16268,4117,16238,learned a lot about the locals who are talented, lively and communicative while being real scallies too
1,16269,4115,16238,I found good people and some bad ones also but the good ones were more than the bad ones
1,16270,4110,16238,And a job and a ruined liver
1,16271,4116,16238,I gained a degree  and a career
1,16272,4117,16267,What is a degree?
1,16273,4112,16238,friends for life, hopefully a good degree and that drinking a lot can harm my health
1,16274,4117,16270,But Cains is really great and deserves to be better know
1,16275,4112,16268,locals are talented?
1,16276,4118,16238,professional degree and education to face the real life
1,16277,4117,16273,Great place for culture, seaside, country and boozing - as well as footie.  Anyone going to Athens?
1,16278,4112,16270,i thought they used mersey river water to make the beer
1,16279,4115,16270,I gained a degree and also the real taste of UK
1,16280,4116,16271,and some good friends that crop up as time goes by.
1,16281,4114,16238,It was great to meet people from all over the shop and not just from my home town
1,16282,4112,16273,too expensive
1,16283,4111,16250,Like drinking Coco and reading?
1,16284,4117,16276,yes - but is it professional or just a basic degree needing a further qualification?
1,16285,4110,16274,Cains is wrong.  My poison was always snakebite.  Or gin
1,16286,4112,16272,that piece of paper you get at the end of 3 years of suffering!
1,16287,4117,16282,Cheap packages - do want a deal?
1,16288,4115,16276,Yes this is what happened to me also I went into real life the hard one
1,16289,4118,16268,what was your subject of education
1,16290,4110,16282,I was in the Kop on Tuesday!
1,16291,4117,16281,Exactly what a campus experiemce is all about.  Thiose who live off site miss all this
1,16292,4114,16268,what all locals are scallies?
1,16293,4113,16239,i am still involved with the university through alumni meetings and also philosophy meetings as well as the career department.
1,16294,4111,16268,a degri in anglesh.
1,16295,4118,16267,in which field please
1,16296,4117,16290,Luck you.  I was on Queens Drive at 7.30 and its was just like the old days - deserted except for Evertonians!
1,16297,4112,16276,shouldn&#039;t we have more practical experience though instead of just theory?
1,16298,4116,16270,And a football team too
1,16299,4117,16271,FAC Tell us more about the degree
1,16300,4110,16286,I was bit disappointed with the actual degree certificate - was expecting a proper scroll with a wax seal!  Was just A4 piece of paper in plastic thingy
1,16301,4118,16269,what do you mean bad ones
1,16302,4111,16274,I&#039;ll drink most things other than vodka
1,16303,4112,16285,gin????
1,16304,4117,16294,New one  on me - ancient or modern?
1,16305,4115,16286,well time will tell waht happen to you and your degree
1,16306,4117,16292,Of course they are!
1,16307,4112,16299,it&#039;s pretty good! i wish there was more practical experience though instead of just theory!
1,16308,4116,16281,Hard to keep in touch with them later?
1,16309,4117,16275,Yes - and a bad health record too.  Never seen so much smoking before I came here
1,16310,4115,16295,chemistry
1,16311,4111,16291,I agree I had to travel in and it was only when I stayed over at friends that I could see and expoerience the fun.
1,16312,4118,16270,what is easy to get the job you want and how long it took you
1,16313,4114,16238,sports and dramatic arts participation opportunities were many and I took full advantage of them
1,16314,4117,16308,No - that is something the University could do better for us
1,16315,4113,16240,I have had the opportunity to meet very different  people from a very varied background. I have increased my knowledge tremendously.
1,16316,4112,16281,i&#039;d agree completly! and i&#039;d also encourage anyone who is thinking of coming to university to stay in university halls
1,16317,4115,16268,well scousers are good people
1,16318,4110,16297,I agree with that, I did a music degree - obviuosly not vocational but I found teaching staff weren;t interested in communicating how what we were learning filtered into a job in any way.  Was left up to yourself to consult careers service etc
1,16319,4117,16313,And tesco is building a new all weather pitch!  Great news for the current undergraduates
1,16320,4114,16306,Ken Dodd?
1,16321,4116,16299,psychology and PGCE
1,16322,4112,16295,business economics
1,16323,4115,16269,well the ones who attack you during night and who use drugs
1,16324,4114,16278,I hope they take out the Mersey Trout first
1,16325,4117,16316,Yes - and also try to meet people on all ranges of course where ever possible.  May be more difficult for those on health course as they do have very much longer hours as I seem to recall.  Is this still true?
1,16326,4111,16257,and onion yummy!!
1,16327,4115,16281,what shop was it
1,16328,4117,16295,Bath Olivers
1,16329,4117,16239,Very as I am working here full time
1,16330,4111,16258,It was what Cromwells mum would shout, when he&#039;d been playing in the garden.
1,16331,4110,16302,vodka is fantastic, only with soda or neat though.
1,16332,4112,16313,it&#039;s not going to happen!!! there is a councillor who has put forward an objection to the council! and it could mean that wyncoat will be public land so the uni wont be able to use it!
1,16333,4114,16277,no but I will be there in spirit.  We will have won it 6 times
1,16334,4116,16316,totally agree I did not and you have to work hard to fill the gap
1,16335,4117,16293,Tell me more about philosophy meetings?
1,16336,4112,16327,asda!
1,16337,4110,16332,no, that land was bequeathed to the University, we&#039;ll get the pitches - insider info!
1,16338,4117,16329,Alumni organisation is very behn other Unievrsities and has a lot  of catching up to do
1,16339,4111,16253,No, naturally brown.
1,16340,4112,16308,i think there could be even a sort of graduates forum on the uni website!
1,16341,4115,16239,well it is ok but not bad not good
1,16342,4119,16315,FAC Can you give details of the particular events that have helped you to do this?
1,16343,4118,16239,I am still associate member of the university, invovle in consultancy in engineering , science and technoloy
1,16344,4117,16239,Still involved working within a subject based alumnus organisation - but we lack ways of increasing membership easily
1,16345,4114,16308,exactly.  Much easier now with email and what have you.  When I was there it was telephone, letter or pigeon post
1,16346,4116,16239,I dont have much contact with this alumni but do get mail from them and have had phone calls from students who ask for money.
1,16347,4112,16294,obviously spelling wasn&#039;t a module!
1,16348,4111,16275,The above comment is a little generalistic, your degree wasn&#039;t in General Studies was it?
1,16349,4115,16343,I know who you are
1,16350,4118,16341,please explain further and why not bad not good
1,16351,4112,16332,love it!
1,16352,4120,16245,Travel discounts sound interesting!
1,16353,4114,16332,it will be nice if Tesco dont get it as they have paid for the upgrade of all the grass pitches.  Sir Terry&#039;s a scouser anyway he will be generous I am sure
1,16354,4110,16340,excellent idea.  I think the University are better at keeping in touch with older graduate contingent but more work needed to tap into younger years.  Web communications like a forum would be best but needs widepsread marketing
1,16355,4111,16320,No they aren&#039;t. Many famous and worthwhile people have come from &#039;The pool&#039; and not all of them are overpaid ball kickers.
1,16356,4112,16240,i think that there should be some kind of &#039;ultimate&#039; alumni card.. which includes entrance to libraries, guild life membership, etc...
1,16357,4110,16345,or morse code
1,16358,4111,16324,Are Mersey trout long, brown and smelly?
1,16359,4120,16241,They could but it should be focussed on the alumni related student and &#039;Faculty&#039; related areas.   If money was raised, there is a case to recommend it focussed on a particualr area which can either help all current staff and students or assist studnets in activities whioch perhaps carry high financial cost
1,16360,4115,16318,yes experience during study is important beacuse when you go to work they want you to be experienced before hand
1,16361,4120,16356,And other cutlure activites on and off campus?
1,16362,4112,16241,i think not! we&#039;ve already think we paid enough and now we also have to contribute financially to the university!!
1,16363,4120,16242,yes - its OK
1,16364,4110,16323,Scousers are the friendliest race in world. Fact
1,16365,4120,16246,The weather
1,16366,4120,16247,Alumni wine cellar
1,16367,4112,16242,i like it and it seems to be updated regularly... we need an online shop though!!
1,16368,4110,16246,Biscuits
1,16369,4112,16245,i defo think we should have some kind of &#039;just graduated&#039; discounts nationally! maybe link in with NUS discounts?
1,16370,4115,16262,what you mean in bed you mean x
1,16371,4112,16345,smoke signals!
1,16372,4120,16342,In my area, its networking with present and past graduates and other from outwith this Institution but in my profession.  This happens at Conferences, meetings in University environments and the Art gallery
1,16373,4123,16271,i think that the degree I gained has been an invaluable tool in enabling me to have lived the life I have and I am delighted that I was 20 when I got it!  It was the last studying that I have had to do in earnest
1,16374,4110,16369,One of the best ideas already in existence is the lifetime Guild membership.  None of my uni mates know about that and I think that would be a great incentive for the young &#039;uns to come up here for a reunion - TIme Tunnel reunion!
1,16375,4115,16368,why biscuits
1,16376,4124,16246,Enjoying life and meeting people, sharing opinions, dreams, aspirations and loves.
1,16377,4120,16240,Little exeprience so far as am actually not a graduate of this institution but havebeen working here for some time
1,16378,4110,16366,Discount LFC season tickets
1,16379,4125,16240,I know you get a magasine and offers to give money to the uni over the phone. also I have been offer to have a credit card
1,16380,4124,16247,Where is it?
1,16381,4110,16375,Why not
1,16382,4113,16240,I know about the range of services offered and I endeavour to attend all the events that we are informed about through<br />e-mails received from Emma Smith. The  last event in the evening was interesting, but the venue was dark and quite &#039;seedy&#039;.<br />It reminded me of a nightclub. And the building was previously a church, which upset a few people. Overall it was useful, because of the diversity of the people attending.
1,16383,4120,16240,Free buscuits?
1,16384,4120,16382,What was the venue so I can avoid it
1,16385,4124,16375,It&#039;s how the cookie crumbles!
1,16386,4112,16342,the guild officers dinner has definatly helped me to understand the past experience of ex-students here!
1,16387,4120,16379,No more credit cards - already have a drawer full of them!
1,16388,4112,16356,definatly!
1,16389,4124,16247,This is like leaving Feedback on Ebay!
1,16390,4122,16382,test
1,16391,4115,16376,well I think doing some thing new in life is all I need
1,16392,4123,16358,you will recognise one when you see them
1,16393,4122,16356,sport, library facilities
1,16394,4120,16379,More useful whould be something which perhaps gives you worthwhile benefits for Liverpool based activities which are nation/internal?  There is a hugh captive market here of graduates and soemone might explore opportunity to benefit and grow business?
1,16395,4112,16369,sorry to break it to you.. time tunnel is gone!
1,16396,4125,16356,I have a card from another Uni and am offered interesting things like a lecture followed by a meal etc. I have also been offered a good deal on health care through Manchester Uni alumni. (Not good enough though)
1,16397,4120,16240,More use of Web2 perhaps?
1,16398,4123,16279,what did UK taste of?
1,16399,4110,16369,There&#039;s various graduate benefit schemes run in banks, unis should do same and develop ideas for each age group.  Eg.  dicount Bargain booze for 21-30 Discount SAGA subscription for 60 plus!  Only joking
1,16400,4115,16367,well it is more colorfull then ever
1,16401,4112,16368,my family, my friends and essentially, my life!
1,16402,4120,16380,I didn&#039;t know there was one?  I would also like to know where it is?
1,16403,4112,16247,we need an online shop!! maybe linking in to the one the guild has?
1,16404,4124,16376,Like this?
1,16405,4120,16247,How about a Cains Liverpool University special brew?
1,16406,4122,16361,was it in the student union or with overseas student center
1,16407,4110,16395,I know.  Along with my life - I spent every Saturday there throughout final year - should&#039;ve been working but was worth the measly 2:2
1,16408,4115,16378,come on you foot ball lover
1,16409,4112,16367,blue and blue!
1,16410,4112,16409,maybe the university is tory?
1,16411,4120,16375,because we all seem to llike them - and they are wonderful icebrakers
1,16412,4110,16405,Someone&#039;s got shares in Cains here!
1,16413,4125,16394,agree it would be good to be able to keep up with the real developments in science and so forth and have lectures at the cutting edge for alumni and friends.
1,16414,4123,16300,you were lucky to get the plastic thingy, be grateful!
1,16415,4120,16246,Liverpool si a great place with a tarnished reputation.   I want to change this - we have a wonderful waterfront, great history and an 800 year medal now - anyone seen it?
1,16416,4110,16411,and dunking ginger nuts in tea is highly therapeutic
1,16417,4120,16409,Up the reds!
1,16418,4112,16299,20??????? were you super clever?
1,16419,4115,16404,yes like this waht we are doing now we should not stop anywhere
1,16420,4112,16373,20??????? were you super clever?
1,16421,4112,16279,tasty!
1,16422,4122,16240,the research and technology news about various project and  its industrial applications
1,16423,4120,16410,Of course it is - anything to rid us otf the current dishonest lot.  Hope they get a drumming today and klet the yellows in....<br />Long life Bannockburn..
1,16424,4110,16415,I don&#039;t think the city has a tarnished reputation, one the contrary we&#039;re about to enter our year as European Capital of Culture - has already has massive economic impact on the city and surrounding region as well as lifting Liverpool&#039;s image nationally
1,16425,4115,16415,yes liverpool is lovely place to live
1,16426,4125,16394,It would also be useful to have a reintroduction to the library at some point and A PASS TO PARK for alumni perhaps in the holidays so that they would be encouraged to get used to using the facilities.
1,16427,4112,16412,ha ha ha
1,16428,4120,16242,One could contribute reflections on life here today.
1,16429,4112,16405,brilliant ebayer!! a
1,16430,4110,16412,I&#039;ve got share in Absolut
1,16431,4120,16247,Could you reissue the old postcards produce in the 1920s as an appeal?
1,16432,4113,16241,I feel that alumni should not have to provide financial support for the university.<br />The onus for financial support for higher education should be on the government.<br />I think that if and only if the alumni feel that they want to contribute to the university out of loyalty, or because they want their university &#039;to go up in the world&#039; - then that is fine.
1,16433,4123,16418,no just someone who did enough work to get through the exams first time, amd was born in July!
1,16434,4120,16412,Mines in M and B
1,16435,4112,16424,yea true, but how many locals actually know what that means? or for that matter, care?
1,16436,4115,16427,yes you must be an agen in Cains
1,16437,4120,16429,Got any maps for sale?
1,16438,4112,16425,depends where you live though!
1,16439,4110,16434,What&#039;s M and B?  Do you mean mnms?!
1,16440,4126,16404,I agree communication is important. It is what keeps us from fighting each other.
1,16441,4120,16412,Real ales - long live CAMPRA
1,16442,4110,16247,or Mills and Boon novels!
1,16443,4112,16401,how random.. i think someone clicked on the wrong link!
1,16444,4120,16378,perhaps we&#039;d be better with a shareholding?
1,16445,4112,16365,isn&#039;t it sunny today?
1,16446,4122,16396,I have an associate card as well but it does not let me access the copmuter- CSD - facilities, I would like to put this proposal/ suggestion to the Alumni office for implementation any support please
1,16447,4110,16403,More insider info - the University is launching an online shop for gifts and memorabilia
1,16448,4112,16295,biscuit production
1,16449,4120,16435,No many have any idea - and see it as something for &#039;toffs&#039;
1,16450,4110,16447,Btw, the Guild one is appalling
1,16451,4120,16415,Hope the new Conference centre is a success.  Can we visit it?
1,16452,4126,16424,Liverpool for many years was a corrupt BLack Hole that used to suck public funding. I hope 2008 cures this.
1,16453,4112,16348,nope.. scouse studies!
1,16454,4115,16428,yes you can reflect on your life anywhere and with any one
1,16455,4112,16355,yea but those deny they are from liverpool... its quite sad really!
1,16456,4120,16374,Friends of Williams Tunnels then?  Anyone been there?
1,16457,4123,16356,agree with this.  I kept my student unon card for a while after I left to access the sports faciliites cheaper.  It would be great to have some kind of &quot;LIVERPOOL UNI PASSPORT&quot; which I could hold with pride (as a kind of business card of you like) but could also offer benefits of discounts on things
1,16458,4120,16352,Automatic Virgin Travel Club - they charge enough!
1,16459,4112,16364,not the ones from toxteth of bootle!
1,16460,4115,16451,well we will see waht they do with the money
1,16461,4126,16425,Got to get,<br />Got to get out.<br />Take the world by the throat and shout.<br />Buy it! Sell it!<br />The game&#039;s getting hard,<br />When all you&#039;re dealt<br />is a losing card!<br />(ALL SING)<br />Bread!
1,16462,4127,16416,there is a website called &#039;a cup of tea and a nice sit down&#039; that is devoted to biscuits and which ones are best for dunking and so on.
1,16463,4112,16433,brilliant! congratulations :)
1,16464,4120,16399,Actually, with Uni charghing us to park, can over 60&#039;s have free travel 24 hours per day please -  a request from a SAGA aged collegues of mine
1,16465,4110,16367,Alumni page should be more prominent on web, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s possible but linking into Myspace and Facebook sites would really boost the amount of younger graduates taking an interest in the University.  Most of my mates use it as main medium of communication nowadays!
1,16466,4120,16247,Free car parking for alumni please
1,16467,4115,16459,yes but they are very different from all of UK
1,16468,4125,16241,I  would have felt in the past that to give money to the uni that I gained so much from would have been ok as |I came through on a grant in the years that I did not have to pay. But now I am haveing to pay for my kids at uni I do not feel able to find extra money for a system I am paying into and I do not feel that they will feel beholden either as they will carry so much debt. The position of government funding to self funding changes public perception aas a place to give money .
1,16469,4120,16442,And free dental care in dental hosptial at any time
1,16470,4126,16447,There are mouse mats on Ebay.
1,16471,4115,16287,well Liverpool is not expensive as London
1,16472,4120,16454,Not sure Lord Brown would like that one!
1,16473,4122,16241,I would like alumni to  support and subsidised events for its members to participate in various development programmes.
1,16474,4123,16240,I know that there are events held now and again in lIVERPOOL AND (oops) elsewhere and there has recentley been a series of guest lectures.  Alumni stuff is covered in Insight, but that is only 6 monthly and it would be nice to have a more frequent e-newsletter to build relationships with the alumni on your database, including me
1,16475,4120,16358,Nope - they are red and blue
1,16476,4120,16398,Tarts
1,16477,4113,16242,I have looked at the alumni website. I prefer hardcopies. I like the insight magazine, as I keep this kind of item for prosterity. However, I realise that most people of this day and age would prefer this form of dissemination. That is their choice. Just as long as computers do not go mad with their binary code. I would like to contribute all my comments.
1,16478,4115,16468,well is very hard to find money for study we should have a free education policy for all who are talented and dynamic
1,16479,4110,16240,I think there should be more focug groups, similar to this, to brainstorm about events that would draw grads in.  Some of the new ideas such as tower walkways are fantastic but needs to be more varied and less formal.  Use the Guild - it&#039;s a fantastic huge venue and where all student memories are born!
1,16480,4126,16410,More tory than that silly tree-hugger Cameron.
1,16481,4120,16279,I love real black pudding.  What is Liverpool able to offer as a unique taste other than Scouse?
1,16482,4122,16241,for financial contribution within reasonable amount will be ok
1,16483,4125,16242,Never have done - not aware of it but perhaps today is a good introduction
1,16484,4110,16383,I&#039;ll second that, bring me a ginger nut! And a cuppa
1,16485,4115,16466,well I have traced you who you are who want a permit
1,16486,4123,16384,wasnt it alma de cuba?  hardly call that seedy!
1,16487,4120,16286,Here is something the University could well develop to make it worth while.  A piece of paper is pretty boreing.  lets think laterall and give everyone a woven cloth degree award!
1,16488,4123,16397,what is wEB2?
1,16489,4120,16295,Brewing
1,16490,4115,16241,yes they should
1,16491,4120,16328,Where can I buy them?
1,16492,4123,16422,agree with this.  People tend to be very parochial and to have a very closeted view and stick to what they know and studied.
1,16493,4110,16449,Utter rubbish, it&#039;s for everyone - the problem is the work being done in the suburbs is not communicted via press as widely as one off cultural events such as the Son et Lumiere event.  08 will benefit the whole city, people are excited - Liverpudlians are proud of this achievement, all of them, not just middle classes
1,16494,4115,16461,well you have done good job you have put the world in words
1,16495,4112,16451,i hope it isn&#039;t!!! it&#039;ll mean that the university wont get all the big gigs anymore... instead people will have to go to the docks!!
1,16496,4110,16461,Better than the Wirral anyway,
1,16497,4112,16450,how come?
1,16498,4120,16364,Yes - every tried saying something to anyone on the Undeground?  Thye look at you as if you&#039;re from Mars!!
1,16499,4112,16447,they can&#039;t... they are tied in to the contract with In the Zoo until 2009 - insider info!
1,16500,4120,16245,Trip on the Ship Canal?
1,16501,4120,16245,Fishing for salmon in mersey
1,16502,4122,16362,to get alumni office organise  wide ranging events  including visits to industrial/ educational establishment here in the uk , europe and abroad ( twin programmes of visit)
1,16503,4120,16245,Why not New Year Cards instead?
1,16504,4112,16437,only for biscuits!
1,16505,4110,16451,The Guild need to sort out their marketing strategy to draw in bigger names to compete with the Arena.  Shouldn&#039;t really compare as different type of venue altogether
1,16506,4125,16399,brilliant idea though. If you attend a paid for  alumni lecture you could have a parking space on a saturday in December.
1,16507,4115,16440,yes it removes all the missunderstandings betweenn all cultures and clash of civilizations.
1,16508,4112,16466,we can give alumni free peg legs instead...
1,16509,4120,16395,What is time tunnel?
1,16510,4113,16245,I thought that knowledge was power  - the best things in life are free. Selfishness and greed are unwarranted.<br />However, if you are struggling on student loans - everthing that is &#039;free&#039; is fine. Christmas cards from whom exactly? Students already receive travel discounts - unless you wallk!
1,16511,4122,16242,I would like to see on line booking/ reservations for events
1,16512,4126,16240,Some of them are good. I particularly like the Houses Of Parliament trip last year.<br />There is a Tower Bridge walk this year.
1,16513,4120,16480,Hope so - he is an idiot!
1,16514,4120,16465,Agree - these &#039;chat rooms&#039; are developing fast these days.
1,16515,4110,16247,Hi Emma!
1,16516,4126,16474,Insight is quarterly.
1,16517,4120,16242,Can the site get prominence from internal web pages in each Faculty?
1,16518,4113,16246,EDUCATION<br />EDUCATION<br />EDUCATION<br />HEALTH<br />HEALTH<br />HEALTH<br />WEALTH<br />WEALTH<br />WEALTH
1,16519,4120,16502,Maybe Erasmus tie up?
1,16520,4110,16509,Was a night run at the Guild every Saturday, &#039;ironic&#039; music from 80&#039;s and cheap bar made it massively popular in the early noughties.
1,16521,4120,16468,Agree.  One of the big problems that all governemnts seem to overlook is that of disposable income.  With high cost of houseing, transport and food in the UK and with increased taxation over the last decade, middle England (UK) is feeling very cash strapped.
1,16522,4126,16245,How about hiring a private suite for alumni at the MEN arena for a concert?
1,16523,4112,16480,remeber who put up taxes!
1,16524,4120,16482,Tax allowable benefit like gift aid perhpas?
1,16525,4110,16246,John Arne Riise
1,16526,4122,16242,It will be good idea for the alumni office to liaise with other professional institutes and organisation( I.Mech.E/ IET)  to co-ordinate and organise events for their members.
1,16527,4120,16241,Are they a Charity?
1,16528,4120,16522,WOMEN area too
1,16529,4125,16245,I think you could have a huge increase in alumni use of the Uni if you put on thoughful events that disseminated new ideas and state of the art lectures and if you got them accredited so that there could be a simple feedback sheet after each session and people could -over the years get some form of award for keeping up to date generally with technology ond so forth or could have specific lectures from thee group of topics and use one a year to contribute to their CPD. You could have the ALUMNI TEN YEAR AWARD&gt;
1,16530,4113,16247,I am really pleased to be involved with the team. It is something interesting to add to my CV. Do you have any employment opportunities?
1,16531,4120,16525,WHO??????
1,16532,4112,16528,what happens if you&#039;re in between?
1,16533,4126,16518,Is that you Tony? I thought you were retiring soon.
1,16534,4110,16532,You go see a doctor
1,16535,4128,16289,well chemistry
1,16536,4112,16515,she isn&#039;t here!!! remeber that
1,16537,4123,16241,a)why not?given that there are 20,000  students here at the moment, I left in 1985 when there was abiut 7,000, that means at a guess in the last 22 years that there must be about 100,000 graduates who have benefiorted from the Uni since then.  Not all of them would be prepared to contribute but the more you can make contact with and send details of fundraising activities/events/whatever then the better chance you have of raisning money, if that is something you choose to do.<br />b) support for economically disadvantaged local kids
1,16538,4110,16536,She is in spirit
1,16539,4120,16505,Agree - its horses for courses.  Anyway there are several venues here other than Guild such as the Foresight, Sherrington , Liverpool Medical Institution etc
1,16540,4122,16245,To improve the CSD- printing/ copying services pay as you go service-
1,16541,4120,16536,I wonder what she&#039;ll make of all this!!
1,16542,4120,16447,Can we have the really tatty pressy?  Bad taste gift at 50p max in cost...
1,16543,4120,16366,Oddbins discount?
1,16544,4132,16527,no they are not they should be not
1,16545,4110,16434,That we&#039;re biscuit freedloading numpties who want to skive off work
1,16546,4130,16238,An endless hangover!
2,16547,4135,0,NEW QUESTION Tell us about your current relationship with the university. (For example, do you still feel connected? Are you still involved? In what ways?)
1,16548,4110,16547,I&#039;m in love with it
1,16549,4120,16533,I have!
1,16550,4133,16547,still connected through the guild... and also as a student!
1,16551,4132,16547,well the University leaves you and forgets you
1,16552,4133,16548,not sure what to make of that... is the uni male or female?
1,16553,4129,16378,agree agree1

1,16567,4120,16556,Can we develop this area?  May well be soemthing to relate to
1,16568,4130,16555,Prefer Guinness.
1,16569,4110,16562,sexist!  It is sooo not. It&#039;s actually animal.  Half lion, half moose
1,16570,4129,16469,I Though uyou could have that if you are prepared to wait and have a trainee do it.
1,16571,4120,16247,Friends of Madisons Cafe?
1,16572,4110,16566,a pint of Cains
1,16573,4131,16516,suppsedly so.  last one before this one was Autumn 2006.
1,16574,4120,16515,HI there!
1,16575,4120,16530,Unpaid!
1,16576,4132,16564,wel it is not Macdonalds
1,16577,4127,16491,If not Tesco, any good deli sells them.
1,16578,4130,16551,Only if you forget it.
1,16579,4110,16550,I&#039;ve heard those Guild officers are all a bunch of geeks.
1,16580,4136,16237,I did not recognise the Bath Oliver/Chocolate Oliver biscuit. Crumbs, chocolate digestives, rich tea, ginger nuts - all good in moderation!
1,16581,4134,16247,please try to arrange some membership card ID for alumni member to acess university facilities/ including CSD- thanks
1,16582,4120,16570,I thought that too.  Actaually they are very good..
1,16583,4130,16556,Like speeling?
1,16584,4132,16561,Cains have alot of gains
1,16585,4131,16544,ooo arrrrr
1,16586,4130,16561,Have you tried Speckled Hen or any other Real Ales? Some of them are good.
1,16587,4134,16247,Please try to e.mail all alumni members for any coming events as a reminder it would be nice and good ideas, althougth it is available on the web site.
1,16588,4132,16530,well it adds nothing to your CV but it adds ideas to their minds who want us to be profiled
1,16589,4120,16247,Actually, what we need to do is something reqlly different from everyone else.  I know little about what other places do but we must avoid copying.    Excursion club?
1,16590,4110,16551,I work here now - have done for nearly four years.  Ironically, I think you&#039;re better looked after as staff as opposed to student.  Pastoral care when i was studying was a real let-down. I found my personal tutor unapproachble and impersonal and made difficult times worse. Sad but true
1,16591,4120,16552,Just remember the liver bird only flaps its wings when a virgin walks past!
1,16592,4131,16477,agree about the hard copy, if you elect to take it that way.  Shopuld be a choice
1,16593,4130,16562,It&#039;s male, like everything. A big ego masquerading as knowledge :0
1,16594,4129,16247,Get graduates involved early on by some free events and free gym pass or something. How about an alumni football challenge on one day a year. Turn up and play. Prizes-medals. If you keep people involved they will stay involved. Getting them back later is much harder and you have fewer years left anyway.
1,16595,4120,16566,Make mine too.  I luv Cains!
1,16596,4132,16538,she is drinking aot of Brandy
1,16597,4120,16564,How about Happy Hour from 2am to 3am to be really different.
1,16598,4120,16568,Ugrrh!
1,16599,4136,16238,Whether one gained a &#039;proper&#039; degree or not is up to the subject matter, also whether it was based on original thought or &#039;copied&#039;.<br />Also whether the &#039;information&#039; was gained from an regulated on-line site.
1,16600,4131,16374,ddint know about it myself.  why didnt someone tell me?
1,16601,4132,16284,well it is professional but still cant find good job
1,16602,4134,16247,try to upgrade the benefits/ services availabe to alumni members with regular review thanks
1,16603,4133,16539,imagine lilly allen playing in the sherrington!!
1,16604,4120,16547,Working at the place shows its strengths and potentail.  Great location, and wonderful view from the highest points on building.
1,16605,4129,16581,I agree let us have a caard that will get us into the library and other places. After all what can you do for past users? Or are you tasked to find out what they can do for you ?
1,16606,4110,16238,Fantastic life experience, close friends and mental stimulation!
1,16607,4120,16246,Sense of community and belonging to something unique.
1,16608,4133,16596,or eating biscuits outside!
1,16609,4110,16531,Ginger LFC player.
1,16610,4130,16542,A badge or tissue paper bookmark, made by Andrex.
1,16611,4133,16581,well how does paying a fiver for example to get life access to email sound?
1,16612,4120,16246,Graduates have different needs - depending on thier degree.  Should we profile this using this approah and some developed questions to ascertain what others see as benefit?
1,16613,4110,16247,It&#039;s my birthday today!
1,16614,4120,16247,Pizzas for tea witht he VC
1,16615,4133,16579,yea they are!
1,16616,4129,16589,Whilst avoiding copying may seem right I do not agree. Look for the best that other unis do and make sure Liverpool Grads have that at least. Afterall most people only have one uni so duplication does not matter
1,16617,4120,16405,I agree
1,16618,4120,16366,I agree
1,16619,4134,16247,try to organise joint events with other local/regional universities
1,16620,4129,16611,I agree
1,16621,4120,16403,I disagree
1,16622,4110,16579,I agree
1,16623,4120,16431,I agree
1,16624,4133,16591,i&#039;m not going to respond to that!
1,16625,4132,16572,Cains make u drunk
1,16626,4129,16613,congratulations
1,16627,4120,16613,Drinks on you then.  Can we meet at Cains?
1,16628,4129,16619,good idea
1,16629,4110,16565,Think the sports alumni stuff is fantastic
1,16630,4120,16619,Sghould we attempt to develop this as discipline based though?
1,16631,4134,16594,I agree
1,16632,4130,16613,Happy Birthday! Let&#039;s all wear hats and throw jelly and ice cream at the computers.
1,16633,4132,16598,No Cobra
1,16634,4110,16627,No way, I&#039;m the vodka woman! Feel free to chuck a case of Absolut my way
1,16635,4133,16487,i agree
1,16636,4120,16594,Less sure about football!   Beach volley ball is more fun.
1,16637,4110,16614,Heard he loves a good pepperoni
1,16638,4120,16632,Yippee!  I agreee...
1,16639,4132,16277,so u watching footies
1,16640,4133,16606,i agree
1,16641,4120,16627,Bad for the liver enzymes!
1,16642,4130,16619,Sounds good, the more the merrier.
1,16643,4133,16313,i agree
1,16644,4110,16632,Excellent idea, any of those biscuits left - ideal food fight material
1,16645,4129,16611,I like the idea of paying a fiver and upgrading your degree to a masters like they do at Oxford/Cambridge-Think its fifty pouds though
1,16646,4132,16601,well it says to be professional but it is not
1,16647,4120,16602,Agree - there is a need though to explore carefully what outcome we wnat from the exercise.  A sense of belonging yes but actually ahve we really thought about what it is as abeast?
1,16648,4136,16240,I think that the idea of the &#039;ultimate&#039; alumni card may cause too much &#039;traffic&#039; for the university, considering that the university already has to deal with a severe shortage of books, and has brought in the &#039;short term&#039; loan system, with exorbitant fines.
1,16649,4130,16632,Can&#039;t have candles, what with &#039;Elf and Safety etc...
1,16650,4120,16613,Its mine soon - Emma has agreed to buy us all a round
1,16651,4120,16613,I love Emma
1,16652,4132,16487,well we need a person not a paper
1,16653,4120,16405,No - I prefere Black Sheep myself!!
1,16654,4130,16594,How about snooker, pool or golf?
1,16655,4110,16595,CAINS CAINS CAINS CAINS CAINS
1,16656,4133,16550,defo think that the university should give the guild more freedom to stay in touch with their members... not only while at uni but once they have graduated
1,16657,4110,16651,Stay away from the CAINS person - they are nuts
1,16658,4130,16651,Sir, I challange you to a duel for the affections of Miss. Emma.
1,16659,4110,16626,thank you very much
1,16660,4133,16579,but hard working geeks!
1,16661,4132,16612,yes we should give degrees which would help in future of a person and give him future direction
1,16662,4120,16609,Ah - hence the ginger nut buscuits
1,16663,4110,16658,Could be a madame!
1,16664,4133,16566,a minger
1,16665,4120,16607,I agree
1,16666,4134,16555,what kind of events you suggesting
1,16667,4130,16658,Really, can I watch?
1,16668,4120,16245,Liverpool crest on condoms
1,16669,4138,16247,virtual communities are the way fo the woprld aty the moment.  Whether it be a website on which you can share your video of you catching a dogfish with a golf club or commenting on the latest fetish film you have seen, people are naturally drawn towards the great feeling of warmth they get from sharing common interests or experiences.  Therefore, I would propose that some kind of online alumni forum should be available for to build up allliances ande allegiances.  I guessa similar thing is available throughh friends reunited and suchlike, but that is not, as far as I know, a messenger type service
1,16670,4129,16566,your leg
1,16671,4132,16666,well in which everyone is involved not just few
1,16672,4120,16529,Lifetime awards.  Maybe a free coffin with the crest on it?
1,16673,4134,16581,any supporters to this proposal please
1,16674,4133,16403,i agree
1,16675,4120,16540,Can you elaborate?
1,16676,4138,16441,is that like a gay CAMRA?
1,16677,4110,16238,Weight.  I put on about 3 stone - booze, take aways, awful halls grub.
1,16678,4120,16503,I agree -  fed up with Xmas Cards
1,16679,4132,16604,well if you work in guild it is ok but you find it hard too
1,16680,4133,16366,maybe discounts on vintage wines instead of a cellar? not sure if the foundation building can fit it all in!!
1,16681,4120,16501,Sounds wacky - are they safe to eat?
1,16682,4134,16611,I agree
1,16683,4110,16662,Spot on
1,16684,4132,16648,I dont have car so no worries
1,16685,4120,16509,Bring back Mozart then
1,16686,4130,16627,Cains is yuck,<br />Cains is silly,<br />Drinking lots,<br />Will shrink your willy.<br />Way not try,<br />Guinness instead,<br />Or whiskey, gin,<br />And wine that&#039;s red!
1,16687,4110,16667,Perve in the vicinity!
1,16688,4133,16555,maybe for the young graduates, some discount on a club night in town?
1,16689,4120,16510,Shanks pony is very good except it costs on footware.  How about university free podiatry/
1,16690,4132,16484,well this is good to have free biscuits atleast from the University
1,16691,4133,16688,like the one being organised externally in london maybe?
1,16692,4137,16591,Please be aware that some might find such comments offensive rather than jokes,
1,16693,4136,16241,Where does the &#039;support&#039; for the University come from anyway? Is it from Sir Alistair Pilkington? More democracy and representation please. I do not have the means to contribute to the University at this point in time. I already support enough &#039;charities&#039;. But it is necessary to build a &#039;base&#039; to run the University.
1,16694,4132,16488,web inside a web
1,16695,4138,16651,...no I love Emma, but not as much as a nice glass of Cains
1,16696,4120,16534,We can do simple things about these problems.  You may confide in us all and tell us your problem...
1,16697,4110,16660,there&#039;s at least one LARGE exception to that. Insider info
1,16698,4133,16677,i think its halls food!! potatoes, pasta and bread... and thats just one meal!
1,16699,4134,16645,you can not upgrade your degree with registration and examination
1,16700,4129,16551,I agree that that was the case in the far past cause at first graduates are poor and want stuff from the uni but have nothing to give financially. I was not contacted for years .<br />Once you get to a certain age and might have some free funds then contact again and now this!!!!!!!! intersting. But other unis are also doing this so a growth area for unis looking for funds or things they can turn into funds. For example Manchester \\uni looked through alumni and invited well known ones to speak at major events.
1,16701,4120,16432,I agree with this.   Again, some market research is needed to see if community sprit is with us.  Friends United of teh University perhaps?
1,16702,4132,16698,well I have gained littile from my stay in the Uni
1,16703,4120,16544,Why?  They surely do opffer benefit and can easily argue it would benefit the wider community
1,16704,4138,16415,I would say that Liverpool HAD a tarnished reputation.  We seemd to have shed that (at least only the &#039;Boys from the Black Stuff&#039; one remains, which os quite amusing)
1,16705,4130,16466,Wasn&#039;t me!
1,16706,4120,16537,Agree with b as there is real poverty in areas.  Support for Inner City Challenge perhpas?  What are we doing about this as an Institution?  Do Alumni know?
1,16707,4132,16319,so you work with tesco
1,16708,4132,16546,Ohh my God
1,16709,4133,16613,mine is only in july :( its ok because at least i can spend it in my pool!!!
1,16710,4141,16702,there was ALWAYS garlic bread swimming in grease.  Got addicted to it and used to pile tray high. Still miss it, was like a big garlic grease sponge mmm
1,16711,4120,16693,Fully transparency is clearly needed as there is a lot on known and unlonwns in this area
1,16712,4138,16246,health, wealth and a nice glass of Cains in the morning
1,16713,4130,16667,LOL
1,16714,4133,16654,maybe for the older generation
1,16715,4120,16342,Yes - within my discipline and meetings related to my personal PG development
1,16716,4132,16712,Oh you love cains so much why is that
1,16717,4136,16242,If new technology is reliable that is fine. If not - then hell might as well break loose.<br />Paper is wasted - but mostly because of mistakes made on the computer. Too much replication takes place. Bring back books. Second thoughts - there are too many books.
1,16718,4120,16356,Agree to a point only.    Would this really benefit most who probably don&#039;t live in merseydise?  Can we think around what one could do nationally?
1,16719,4134,16699,sorry I meant without not with
1,16720,4120,16240,Our own TV programmes with a Mersey feel?
1,16721,4120,16240,On-line blog and Wiki?
1,16722,4132,16710,are u a cook
1,16723,4138,16246,having thought aout this a lot recently, the things important to me (not necassarily in any order of significance) are<br />-health<br />-enough money<br />-family<br />-freedoms<br />-safety
1,16724,4143,16247,I have a new idea how about alumni who attend an event in their first year as a graduate get their student loan reduced
1,16725,4141,16722,I am now!  I can boil a WHOLE pan of rice!
1,16726,4130,16505,The Guild is run mainly by inexperienced students who couldn&#039;t plan their way out of a paper bag. That is why it doesn&#039;t run properly.
1,16727,4132,16724,well we should talk then type
1,16728,4120,16669,This is cerainly a way forward - blogs and Wikis are very much today along with podcasts.   We do need to watch the future direction on this one.
1,16729,4134,16247,To arrange / organise an international joint venture events with other universities world wide
1,16730,4136,16247,Best Wishes from a would be Philosopher.

1,16749,4160,16737,Lime Street Station at Rush Hour
1,16750,4160,16737,The Tunnels at Rush Hour
1,16751,4169,16749,on the platform?
1,16752,4159,16737,Kingsway &amp; Queensway Tunnels. Monday Morning rush hour.
1,16753,4169,16750,How many? which ones?
1,16754,4169,16752,Why K &amp; Q
1,16755,4157,16737,liverpool railways systems. (lime st) core business centre.
1,16756,4160,16751,Try and derail a full train into the platform
1,16757,4159,16754,Mass casualties and transportation gridlock.
1,16758,4160,16757,Would we use a vehicle borne IED ?
1,16759,4159,16737,John Lennon Airport
1,16760,4169,16756,any particular platform? &amp; is the London train but what are the chances of it derailing far enough in?
1,16761,4160,16759,A plane would be difficult given the number of police there
1,16762,4169,16759,Train links?
1,16763,4160,16762,Lime street would be better
1,16764,4159,16761,Acces Runway (Airside) cripple aircraft coming into land.
1,16765,4169,16737,Does any of this need explosives? what about other mass cas strats?
1,16766,4169,16763,Than?
1,16767,4159,16762,Suggest targeting one or two stations further eastwards to disrupt possible disater recovery.
1,16768,4160,16765,we&#039;d need explosives for sure - best overall effect even if we don&#039;t kill that many people
1,16769,4160,16767,yes multiple strikes simultaenously to disrupt the plod
1,16770,4159,16737,Blow bridges at the end of the M62.
1,16771,4160,16765,could we use the fuel dumps at any of these places instead of explosives
1,16772,4172,16752,Evening would be better as would cause the city to grid lock rather than the wirral
1,16773,4169,16767,yes - interesting issue of thinking about inetrvening in the recovery system<br />1 - frustrates emergency services and makes them look bad<br />2 - increase casualties - thinking 7/7 here - how much more &#039;effective&#039; if prevent paramedics and local hospital services and other first responders doing their jobs effectively
1,16774,4160,16772,could we hit tunnels and lime street at same time to cause maximunm gridlock within liverpool and disrupt casevac
1,16775,4160,16773,I think this is crucial as we saw the effect in london and madrid
1,16776,4160,16770,could this be easily overcome by re-routing traffic
1,16777,4160,16770,what about adding in the underground system
1,16778,4159,16751,Take over an approaching ship (vessel), head down the Mersey and crash it into Albert Docks on a Special event day. i.e Regatta.
1,16779,4169,16776,not likely - already a nightmare to get in and out
1,16780,4172,16774,what about when liverpool or everton are having a midweek home game.
1,16781,4160,16778,even better if we hit the fuel terminals, fuel leaks into mersey and then ignites
1,16782,4160,16778,A ship full of toxic chemicals would be best, particularly if we can make them airborne after the crash
1,16783,4159,16758,Yes! 4 truck/nail bomb type vehicles, all vehicles just inside the tunnels on entry and exits.
1,16784,4160,16779,i don&#039;t think it will kill enough people
1,16785,4172,16753,both the road and the rail this will then send all the traffic over the bridge.  if that can then be disrupted this will force all the traffic into warrington. to cross the mersey
1,16786,4160,16760,depends on what speed it was going at entry
1,16787,4157,16738,if possible c4/semtex due to the small quantity required and ease of movement and installation of this plastic. logistics of its use meens alot more damage can be inflicted with relative ease. no doubt &#039;&#039;hme&#039;&#039; would be the other option for an explosive compound.<br />if only a small quantity of explosives are to be used in this attack, i would have to incorporate fragmentation of some kind to magnify its effects. (inflict more casualties)<br />i would choose multiple targets for full effect and without doubt would have secondary targets covered, most proberbly the very units/departments that will be responding to this attack. (police, fire, bomb des. units etc...)<br />i would most certainly use timed devices and some these devices would be timed many hours after the initial trigger, even days as to effect the clean up operations in place.<br />realistically i would use my influence on many friends i still have serving in the forces to obtain the plastics needed.<br />however if i had no military contacts, it would have to be hme, made by myself using a flavour of agricultural pesticides and fertilisers.
1,16788,4160,16787,how much plastics are we talking about - would it be missed
1,16789,4169,16737,TRAINS - WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW (MAPS ETC?)
1,16790,4160,16789,timetables
1,16791,4160,16789,security cameras
1,16792,4160,16789,number of police, any armed
1,16793,4159,16749,Blow up Concorse House Office block. The debris then falls down onto Lime Street Station.
1,16794,4169,16789,Do you need locations of local hospitals?
1,16795,4160,16794,blocked by traffic confusion outside
1,16796,4159,16737,Blow up hospitals.
1,16797,4169,16794,timed devices at first responder locations would be very disruptive
1,16798,4160,16789,disrupt power system by taking out substations
1,16799,4157,16739,these would be long term accociates, trusted and good strong characters with very little attachment to any one or anything. able to detach from any mental obstivle and crack on with the task in hand.<br />would only usea very small group (smaller cells obviously dont draw as much attension)
1,16800,4169,16792,4 max
1,16801,4160,16789,use dirty bomb to instil panic even if no one dies at scene
1,16802,4169,16792,4 at Lime street - not sure elsemwhere
1,16803,4160,16796,take out a/e and ambulance station so can&#039;t respond to casaulties
1,16804,4172,16794,Liverpool side of the river<br />Fazakerly(Aintree). Liverpool Royal.  Broadgreen<br />Wirral side of the river<br />Arrow Park. Claterbridge
1,16805,4160,16797,car bomb in stations car park as obvious rv for emergency vehicles
1,16806,4159,16789,Note : TARGET COMMUNICATIONS. BR have huge communication Fibre Nodes running in the Cess, down all major rail routes.
1,16807,4160,16806,would this take out radio comms - maybe blind cctv
1,16808,4169,16804,whic of these would likley be first responder and base for casualties?
1,16809,4160,16799,would you have enough for planned multiple strikes - if large amounts of hme needed then we&#039;d quite a few bombers
1,16810,4159,16807,Depends if Repeaters or Radio Break out points are used, but, yes... both.
1,16811,4172,16803,Fazakerly has a ambulance station next to the hospital.  which houses a few ambulances when not in use.
1,16812,4160,16802,take out cctv to hide evidence
1,16813,4160,16803,most hospitals have attached ambulance stations - there are also satellite stations like the one by the cains brewery
1,16814,4159,16801,Does&#039;nt need to be a &quot;Dirty Bomb&quot;, this can be hyped up with an anon call to the local radio station.
1,16815,4169,16758,Are we talking Lime Street as primary target with Kingsway &amp; Quenssway as secondary. Then further disruption at choice hospitals?
1,16816,4160,16807,if we took out the central co-ordinating location through explosives or knocking out power then the whole system would crash and the response with it
1,16817,4172,16808,Liverpool Royal then Fazakerly(Aintree) for caualties on this side of the river.  Oh I think that there is a burns unit at Wiston of the M62
1,16818,4160,16814,any source of radiation at scene would cause widespread long-term panic way out opf proportion to original attack
1,16819,4160,16817,there is also hospitals in warrington, manc and runcorn that could be easily reached by air ambulance
1,16820,4169,16819,Ok  - LIME street looks possible with Royal and Fazakerly hospitlas as secondary targets
1,16821,4167,16800,if you do it on a football match day - may be more police about
1,16822,4167,16821,but at the same time - more potential casualities
1,16823,4160,16789,which trains carry the most people at specific times, at what time is the station full
1,16824,4159,16815,Suggest both Lime Street and Tunnels, but this would be difficult to coordinate.
1,16825,4160,16822,the more police there are then the more likely that they may prevent the attack - surely we woudl want a time when the plod are off eating or soemthing
1,16826,4159,16780,Yeah... lets do it!
1,16827,4160,16820,if we hit the station and the nearest hospitals then the disruption to road and rail would prevent proper casevac - not enough choppers. if we add runcorn bridge to the mix then all of the motorways and surroundign roads will knocked out
1,16828,4167,16825,police would only be at the station - if you were coming in from some other city by train - maybe less chance of getting caught?
1,16829,4157,16740,primarily i would have the actual rail terminal as my target for max. impact during rush hour.<br />this would be followed up with a series of secondary devices, detenated on imbound passenger trains.<br />rather than one device so many smaller fragmented packages would be planted throughout the train, with a certain ammount of devices set to detinate at random times within the emergency service access to the station and public holding or rally points etc...<br />recon of this facility is essential and this intel may take several months of planning.<br />focus would be on just how this station is used. where the most populated areas are and at what times. security protection of all routes in and out must be observed and the locality of all services attending this station would also be observed.<br />response times, look up history of events past and try and build a clearer picture of how rail staff and passengers as well as services would react to the initial explosion and where this would take them.<br />to plant these devices undetected would be the real challenge. detailed observations of the carriges themselves would be crutial. baggage compartments are a little obvious and sometimes too complicated, i would be looking for places you can not be observed, such as toilet areas. cavities within the structure and even the possibilities of planting these devices under the chassis of the carriges themselves. etc...
1,16830,4167,16789,where are the road works happening
1,16831,4160,16737,primary target is lime street and secondary targets are the first responders. additional targets include the road conenctions in and around merseyside to disrupt the responders.
1,16832,4159,16738,Multiple Petrol Bombs or liquid bombs disguised in 2 ltr soft drinks bottles.
1,16833,4160,16832,use next to fuel dump
1,16834,4159,16740,Infilrate and locate main water source then....poison.
1,16835,4172,16832,what about hydrogen proxide
1,16836,4157,16741,obviously the biggest hurdle is being detected, not only planting your devices at targets but remaining covert whilst planning and on recce.<br />blending in to the current activities in your target area ! (dont stand out in the croud)<br />communications are also very important, iwould use no telephone coversation at all and no radio comms. location of meeting points crucial.
1,16837,4159,16799,Remember there will always be a weak link on the perifury of the group.
1,16871,4226,16861,HR Puff and Stuff<br />It was produced by drug induced academics who had nothing better to do!!!!
1,16872,4221,16861,Big Brother - due to the hours of my life I could have spent doing something so much less boring instead.
1,16873,4222,16865,BB is genius and I regard this comment as heretical.
1,16874,4215,16861,Holyocks, because it&#039;s tripe and no one can act.
1,16875,4225,16861,Scrubs
1,16876,4211,16861,Almost any soap opera I&#039;ve seen. They distort real life, but somehow still manage to get people hooked. Their title music is terrible as well in general.
1,16877,4213,16861,Reality TV shows because they are so ridiculous
1,16878,4224,16861,The Pick-Up Artist
1,16879,4220,16861,All hospital programmes - surely the encourage people to do things wrong?!
1,16880,4214,16861,Big Brother
1,16881,4219,16861,worst movie of all time: jerry... two hours of two men walking through a desert... and thats it really. climax: one of them climbs up on a rock and cant get down anymore!!
1,16882,4217,16865,get rid of it!
1,16883,4220,16875,Take out the arogant main character
1,16884,4226,16869,Make everyone wear masks.
1,16885,4218,16865,by actually filling it with people who have something interesting to say
1,16886,4216,16865,Big Brother is not genius...
1,16887,4222,16866,To improve Hollyoaks, I would employ classically trained actors.
1,16888,4215,16866,send them to drama school
1,16889,4225,16869,Stop making it so melodramatic when it comes to little things--reality tv has nothing to do with reality!
1,16890,4220,16877,Put a group of psychologists in
1,16891,4219,16879,could improve this by making it more realistic... eg not shocking people when they are flatlining and, also, as in scrubs, hang up the x ray photo the RIGHT way around..
1,16892,4212,16866,hire people based on acting skills and not modelling skills
1,16893,4216,16865,there is no way BB can be improved!!!!
1,16894,4210,16877,Pick and choose the contestants and do not allow people with too big an ego
1,16895,4226,16875,Nice outfits though
1,16896,4224,16875,How can anyone hate Scrubs?  You have to love the format of the show; it&#039;s something that hasn&#039;t been done to death
1,16897,4211,16877,Introduce some ethical learning, something that the public will actually benefit from. Young people ideolise the shallow celebrity status, but they should be provided with role models or at least see what happens to those shallow, self-obsessed people.
1,16898,4216,16875,Scrubs is just great!!<br />Love it
1,16899,4221,16868,Police work versus tv - it would be poor ratings to watch PC Plod sat knocking out a statement for 4 hours
1,16900,4214,16865,get people on the show who actually have a brain
1,16901,4216,16896,I totally agree
1,16902,4221,16862,To learn
1,16903,4216,16863,Oh God it&#039;s gonna be so much work!!!
1,16904,4219,16862,hope to gain both theoretical and applicable insight into decision making during crises in police investigations... eg during negotiations with terrorists, hijackers, etc
1,16905,4212,16862,a realistic idea of the way in which psychology can contribute to policing
1,16906,4213,16862,I hope you learn about the police setup in the UK and what research can be done and how receptive the police are to research
1,16907,4226,16862,To be able to produce a piece of work that has relevance to investigative practice.
1,16908,4212,16862,overview of the way in which the criminal justice system works
1,16909,4225,16862,To learn new/different analysis techniques; to gain a more global understanding of crime/research; to become more marketable in terms of jobs; to further develop current research interests and possibly add a few new ones
1,16910,4215,16862,a greater depth of knowledge into the theories surrounding criminal behaviour. Knowledge of psychology and how this can be linked to police investigations.
1,16911,4219,16862,gain research ideas for topics in forensic field.. ie for dissertation but eventually maybe to lead into a phD position
1,16912,4218,16862,I expect to gain an insight into how things work within the field of investigative psychology and in policing, and to gain the knowledge and perhaps oppurtunities that will allow me to advance in this field.
1,16913,4217,16862,to actively learn skills and theories that will enable me to carry out research.
1,16914,4224,16862,To get a better understanding of the investigative process;<br />To really understand what profiling means in every sense of the word;<br />To build a firm foundation for my later career work;
1,16915,4214,16862,To enhance my knowledge of the subject and to understand the practical applications of forensic psychology in the real world
1,16916,4222,16862,I expect to give up sleep and risk a divorce, but hope to get greater understanding of how the work I do can improve.
1,16917,4210,16862,Gain a greater knowledge of why people commit crime. Find out something about what makes them tick.<br />Look forward to a wide range of outside speakers who will bring a great deal of information, which will undoubtedly lead to a great deal of debate.
1,16918,4221,16862,To be able to better understand the theory and practice behind critical incident management and decision making in often the most complex of scenarios.
1,16919,4211,16862,I am hoping that I will come out of this course confident about the area I want to work in, that I enjoy being involved in cases and will be a reputable Behavioural Investigative Advisor on an international level. I hope I will gain a thorough understanding of all issues involved be they research or applied.
1,16920,4223,16862,Hope to improve my understanding of this area, improve my research skills and come away with some idea of what I want to do in the future. I look forward to learning about interviewing techniques. In particular I look forward to hearing about Graham Wagstaff&#039;s area.
1,16921,4213,16862,a realistic idea about the potential for offender profiling
1,16922,4216,16862,to have both practical and theoretical knowledge of the forensic part of psychogy which must be really interesting
1,16923,4225,16862,To be grounded in the more practical/practicioner side of things, rather than the abstract, purely academic end
1,16924,4215,16862,To improve research skills
1,16925,4226,16862,Research and learning on decision making that impacts upon fast time critical incidents
1,16926,4219,16918,YES that is exactly what i want to learn about
1,16927,4220,16862,I hope to gain a thorough understanding of the way in which Investigative and Forensic Psychology can aid in criminal investigations and then act on this knowledge in a practical setting
1,16928,4221,16863,Balancing course with home and work, without compromising any of them.
1,16929,4220,16862,To make friends with police officers!
1,16930,4222,16910,I want some knowledge of theory beyond the course-related knowledge I have been fed in the past.
1,16931,4212,16862,to understand the areas in which the police are already using psychology and try to pick up on any areas which could warrant further work
1,16932,4215,16862,learn from other people on the course and explore how psychology in the criminal justice system is perceived by different professionals
1,16933,4213,16919,this sounds liek a good plan
1,16934,4219,16920,I also look forward to learning about interviewing techniques, specifically with regard to witnesses, eg. children
1,16935,4218,16929,and it will be interesting to learn from them
1,16936,4226,16916,How about retaining a life?
1,16937,4225,16863,Making sure that 1--I really belong here and 2--that I can keep up with everyone else!
1,16938,4220,16862,To come away with a real idea of the areas that interest me most and be able to properly explain to people what Investigative Psychology involves
1,16939,4226,16908,Or does not work
1,16940,4222,16921,I want to know if profiling can be adapted to work contemporaneously fro negotiation subjects.
1,16941,4220,16935,Of course, and that too.
1,16942,4216,16923,Definately!!
1,16943,4211,16933,Thank you!  :-)
1,16944,4223,16863,Statistics and how to apply them properly.
1,16945,4219,16863,the 6:1 ratio, i might have miscalculated but if we do have 3 full days of class a week then we have to work for an averga eof 25 hours a day the other two days of the week to reach the ratio...
1,16946,4225,16862,I second this one!
1,16947,4214,16862,To establish theory and skills that will enable me to progress in this subject as a career
1,16948,4216,16935,I agree
1,16949,4224,16862,To try to fathom the recesses of the criminal mind in the hopes of understanding why they commit them
1,16950,4212,16936,that&#039;s more hope than expectation, isn&#039;t it?!?
1,16951,4218,16930,i totally agree - i look forward to the real world aspect of the course
1,16952,4221,16864,Experience, commitment, enthusiasm, motivation.
1,16953,4213,16929,They look unfriendly
1,16954,4217,16862,To develop critical awareness of the way in which the legal system functions.
1,16955,4210,16862,To understand how useful statistics are and how they can be interpreted
1,16956,4219,16864,I have a pretty strong background of statistics, hope i can help myself!!! and others with this
1,16957,4211,16936,You can  combine what you&#039;re about to do here and retain a happy family life, and I do hope you will succeed at both!  :-)
1,16958,4216,16953,No
1,16959,4223,16864,research
1,16960,4225,16945,Thanks--now I will have nightmares!
1,16961,4226,16863,Talking too much and not listening enough
1,16962,4224,16863,Getting all the reading done in a timely fashion...
1,16963,4210,16863,The amount of reading<br />Will I understand statistics?
1,16964,4220,16862,To be able to talk to lecturers without feel that you are taking up their research time
1,16965,4215,16863,have the skills to carry out the research well
1,16966,4219,16953,No, they dont! Dont be afraid of the big bad policemen, they&#039;re on our side! (sort of...)
1,16967,4218,16944,im ok with stats. but worried i dont really know enough about policing and how it works
1,16968,4214,16945,This is also a concern for me - that calculation appears to be correct, which leads me to wonder how we fit that in?
1,16969,4226,16863,Travelling and punctuality
1,16970,4212,16863,finding the inspiration for dissertation and stats project... where do you start?
1,16971,4216,16945,Me too
1,16972,4213,16863,Finding and conducting research
1,16973,4211,16945,All universities say that, I think it is really up to you how you use your time, efficiency applies here too. If you can do really well in 1 hour you don&#039;t need to sit around trying to concentrate for 3 hours!
1,16974,4221,16862,To deliver an academic piece of work that is relevant and helpful to my field of work (Hostage and Crisis Negotiation/ ritical Incident Management/ Police Decision Making)
1,16975,4222,16863,I don&#039;t know where to start, what to read and what to ignore, how to extract the information I need and how to write an essay, but, other than that, it shgould be a piece of piss!
1,16976,4220,16863,That I have forgotten how to write a psychological essay
1,16977,4219,16931,To work closely with policemen and make a career in which we can &quot;combine our forces&quot;
1,16978,4213,16863,getting access to police data and finding a placement
1,16979,4223,16944,You can read about them and learn all you want but how do you actually apply them. I never knoew which test to use
1,16980,4226,16863,Can I drink enough to keep up with the post grads!
1,16981,4210,16961,Agree - will have to hone my listening skills learn to listen to others and then offer an opinion
1,16982,4225,16863,Understanding some of the terminology/concepts that are a bit foreign to what I have been previously taught.  That and making it to campus on time!
1,16983,4218,16945,take it with a pinch of salt. we are students after all
1,16984,4224,16864,Motivation and determination; steadfastness and curiosity
1,16985,4217,16903,and then some! Think of the greatest amount of work it&#039;s humanely possible to carry out in one week, then times it by 10.
1,16986,4220,16863,Time management when there are many deadlines at once
1,16987,4211,16970,Good point! I don&#039;t know how we can even set up that project, what do we have access to? What can we use? etc etc
1,16988,4219,16862,To come out of this master with a career prospect in which I can work on an international level with police forces/negotiators across the world
1,16989,4222,16963,There is a 98% chance I will not have a clue about statistics, or is that a 0.98% chance?
1,16990,4220,16980,Practice makes perfect
1,16991,4216,16973,maybe but I also think that you dont need that much time for each subject or lecture. You might know more about something and there is no need to study 6 hours for that hour of lecture
1,16992,4214,16976,That I have forgotten how to write essays completely!
1,16993,4218,16962,getting to class in a timely fashiojn would be a good start for me!
1,16994,4223,16956,Please do!
1,16995,4217,16937,glad to see someone else shares the same concerns as me - power in numbers.
1,16996,4215,16970,am also worried about this where do you start there are so many potential areas
1,16997,4224,16944,Getting re-acquainted with Statistics...an old foe...and very formidable
1,16998,4226,16976,What&#039;s an essay?
1,16999,4222,16976,When you remember, please tell me.
1,17000,4218,16970,i feel the same too
1,17001,4225,16944,Some of the &quot;cheat&quot; books (Cronk&#039;s SPSS book, etc) help a lot because they are straightforward
1,17002,4220,16967,Make friends with the police officers...
1,17003,4211,16979,I think it was a good idea mentioned earlier to get together with some other people and do some research together, that might help everyone involved. Any statistics-wiz-kid volunteers?
1,17004,4218,16980,we&#039;ll see tonight!!
1,17005,4214,16980,Get a spare liver
1,17006,4216,16970,exactly!!!!HELP!!!
1,17007,4219,16974,I wonder who wrote this one? :)
1,17008,4226,16962,Fashion for the police officers is a problem full stop....
1,17009,4219,17003,at your service! too bad this is anonymous...
1,17010,4213,16980,if you have trouble, we will call the police!
1,17011,4211,17005,Actually, can I sell mine? I&#039;m skint!
1,17012,4217,16970,pick up a general investigative psych text book, make a note of all the chapters on different pieces of paper. tear them up, throw them in the air and pick one at random.
1,17013,4215,16970,How to write the essays to MSc level it&#039;s been a while since i have done one!
1,17014,4225,16980,Lots of water...and be prepared for the occasional hangover.  I promise to make sure everyone I&#039;m with has a safe way home, though!
1,17015,4216,16864,I am not sure....
1,17016,4219,16970,How about the fact that we have to come up with a topic for our research withint the next two weeks?! i dont think my summer holiday will provide enough inspiration
1,17017,4218,16864,i am good at drinking!!!
1,17018,4211,16956,Yep, your name please?
1,17019,4222,16956,Please name your drink.
1,17020,4217,16864,random and totally ridiculous suggestions
1,17021,4215,16864,Practical background working with offenders.
1,17022,4216,16985,Thanks I feel so much better now....!!!!
1,17023,4218,16956,i&#039;m ok at stats too
1,17024,4214,16997,I didn&#039;t like stats the first time I had to deal with them and I&#039;m not sure that I&#039;m any fonder of them now....
1,17025,4213,16864,Energy
1,17026,4220,16956,I love it!!!!!!!
1,17027,4226,16864,Police experience, good and bad
1,17028,4212,16864,healthy air of cynicism
1,17029,4222,16864,Experience and willingness to learn.
1,17030,4220,17026,Sorry, not stats, that was the subject in general
1,17031,4213,17021,that will be useful
1,17032,4211,16956,I can help with emotional problems, I&#039;m qualified, you know.
1,17033,4225,16864,Wow...this is a hard question.  I&#039;m stubborn (fair warning), I&#039;m pretty good on theory, I work hard and I am always willing to both give help and ask for it
1,17034,4215,16864,determination
1,17035,4223,16956,experience with working within academia and how to work with academics... it is harder than it sounds!
1,17036,4219,17026,honestly, there is no such thing as loving statistics....!
1,17037,4217,16864,providing everyone else with someone to laugh at (not intentionally - it just seems to happen that way).
1,17038,4226,16864,A lot of &quot;What ifs&quot;
1,17039,4216,16928,Sorry!I don&#039;t think that will happen...!No balance possible...
1,17040,4210,16864,My previous experience.<br />100% attendance at lectures etc.<br />Dedicate myself to the studies and read as much as possible, hoping I understand!
1,17041,4213,17028,I agree
1,17042,4212,17015,this is a tough question for the first day...
1,17043,4219,17026,Strong theoretical background in social  (and some cognitive psychology), might help with the decision making parts of the course!
1,17044,4214,17020,there&#039;s more than one of us doing this?
1,17045,4220,17021,A prisoner told me I was posh - does that help
1,17046,4225,17023,Me too, once I get a chance to get back into it.  Also pretty good with SPSS
1,17047,4216,16937,and as me...then I guess we do belong here and we will see if we will keep up with everyone else...
1,17048,4210,17027,Being honest about some of the people emplyed by the police service
1,17049,4226,17026,Advice - I often give it though it is seldom asked for.
1,17050,4220,17023,I take pretty detailed notes, both from lectures and reading
1,17051,4216,17042,Very tough...
1,17052,4222,17020,Excellent, we cant form a splinter group. What shall we be called?
1,17053,4213,17042,I think it only gets harder
1,17054,4219,17028,Basically, I am a nerd.. have always read every page of assigned readings, always done with assignments on time (if not early)... hmm come to think of it i dont know how this helps any of you guys... :)
1,17055,4216,17020,???
1,17056,4212,16864,willing to question received wisdom of research
1,17057,4215,16959,yeah me too some research experience of the hard process of writing research and realistic time frame of getting it finished for a deadline!
1,17058,4213,17045,what did you tell him?
1,17059,4218,17020,can i join?
1,17060,4217,17015,Think it would be easier to provide the meaning of life than give a straight answer to this question.
1,17061,4211,16864,This is a really good tool, by the way. Don&#039;t we all feel a bit less alone with our concerns now?
1,17062,4222,17055,Randon suggestion specialists&#039; group.
1,17063,4220,17045,That&#039;s a secret, of course
1,17064,4212,17060,42
1,17065,4219,17050,I was always laughed at by my friends and classmates about how deatiled my notes were.. at one point they were color-coded, i agree this MIGHT be going a step too far..
1,17066,4225,17059,I&#039;m in, as well
1,17067,4214,17015,at this stage, this is one of the questions that I&#039;m asking myself - where do I fit in and what can I bring to the course? It&#039;s not easy to answer at this stage, as there is still the general apprehension about fitting in at all....
1,17068,4226,16864,A door into some fields of investigation that urgently require critical thinking.
1,17069,4216,17061,Not really...
1,17070,4218,17061,for sure
1,17071,4222,17054,MAkes me worry more - I have never been so industrious
1,17072,4223,17061,I actually do feel much less scared
1,17073,4211,17049,Hah! Me too!
1,17074,4218,17059,wow, its like a cult!

1,17466,4278,17085,I&#039;d set up some kind of restraining order, if one is not already in place, against Derek.  If he doesn&#039;t comply with it, he&#039;ll be arrested
1,17467,4278,17086,5
1,17468,4284,17443,suggest constant supervision to the staff at the reparation team
1,17469,4270,17085,I would first like to talk to Derek and get his version of the story.  If it matches with that of his key worker, then culpability must be established.  Derek needs to work on anger management and this shows increased violence and more widespread harm from his last offence.  I would discuss whether or not Sanford Lodge would like to press charges and proceed from there, based upon their decision.
1,17470,4273,17088,Have meeting with Paul to discuss the option of alcohol and drug detoxicification programme.
1,17471,4278,17087,5
1,17472,4270,17086,7
1,17473,4269,17082,Speak to Wai Yan and Phil from reparation team to get more details about bad attitude.  Report incident to parents.  Don&#039;t take him off reparation work as this would reward bad behaviour.  Warn him that next incident of disruption will be reported to police, if victim does not want to press charges in this case
1,17474,4270,17087,7
1,17475,4283,17085,inform him that further criminal damage could result in further conviction and breach of order
1,17476,4273,17089,10
1,17477,4283,17085,apply for anger anagement course
1,17478,4269,17083,3
1,17479,4271,17088,The braech of the order should be brought to the notice of the relevant parties. Paul should be advised that he has breached &#039;the order&#039; and there should be no repetition in the future.
1,17480,4278,17088,I&#039;d set up some kind of restraining order, if one is not already in place, against Derek. If he doesn&#039;t comply with it, he&#039;ll be arrested
1,17481,4278,17089,5
1,17482,4271,17089,Importance 5
1,17483,4278,17090,5
1,17484,4273,17086,5
1,17485,4284,17082,Suggest to parents about allowing him to continue with football if his behaviour improves
1,17486,4271,17090,Regret 2
1,17487,4269,17084,5, depending on consequences; seems to be an incident of disruption rather than an intent to cause severe harm
1,17488,4283,17082,explain what will happen if he continues not to comply with his order or if he assults another yp-possible breach of his order
1,17489,4273,17083,1
1,17490,4284,17085,Maintain supervision of Derek and limit his contact with harmful materials
1,17491,4283,17085,look into ETE straight away
1,17492,4273,17087,10
1,17493,4273,17090,5
1,17494,4273,17084,1
1,17495,4284,17085,Arrange group therapy to address pro-social behaviour and ways to resolve conflict successfully
1,17496,4270,17088,Paul obviously means to threaten his victim further, which was one of the fears listed by the victim in the care profile.  The victim worker indicated that Paul had obviously been drinking.  I would like to determine if his alcohol and substance use has increased (meeting with Paul) and call the judge to discuss what, if anything, can be done to keep him away from her and to determine what sanctions would be imposed should he continue to harass her.
1,17497,4270,17089,5
1,17498,4270,17089,5
1,17499,4270,17090,5
1,17500,4284,17088,Provide Paul with therapy addressing his behaviours and conflict resolution, including empathy for the victim
1,17501,4278,17085,I&#039;d put him to work some where in the home where he resides so that he could pay for the damages to his room and bed.  He&#039;d be warned about further such attempts but if they happen again, it would call for police intervention.
1,17502,4278,17086,3
1,17503,4278,17087,3
1,17504,4283,17088,anager management address issues either in offending behaviour sessions or course, victim empathy needs addressing asap as he appears to have no consideration for victim
1,17505,4269,17085,Inform police and field worker.  Incidence of criminal damage, could have had very serious consequences if fire had got out of control.  Seems to be a pattern of respondign violently to authority, some kind of anger management intervention may be necessary.  Due to lack of information on Derek&#039;s behaviour from previous accomodation, would get official bodies i.e. police, social workers involved to make them aware of problem behaviour
1,17506,4284,17088,Try to get Paul involved in community activites (which may not be available to him) such as a youth service or sport club that models non-criminal behaviour and provides him with an opportunity to engage in social contact under the supervision of an adult or social worker
1,17507,4269,17086,7, behaviour could escalate
1,17508,4269,17087,7
1,17509,4284,17100,Discuss actions with parents and store owner, ask specific details about what happened and why he was concerned, again suggest that Jake is allowed to continue with football if his behaviour improves and sugest other potential rewards for improving his behaviour
1,17510,4284,17101,6
1,17511,4283,17100,discuss withJake, however there is no direct evidence as people in the community seem unwilling to come forward. Inform Jake of the implications if he breaches his order
1,17512,4284,17102,4
1,17513,4278,17100,Issuance of some kind of restraining order against Jake specifically since that shopowner&#039;s business seems to be a target of preference.  If the attacks continue, put him on probation or some sort of juvenile detainment.
1,17514,4278,17101,2
1,17515,4278,17102,3
1,17516,4270,17103,No.  The decision has been left to me and, based upon his mental health nurse&#039;s recommendation and a review of his case profile, I believe it is the correct one.  He has not previously displayed firesetting behavior.  If there is a second incident, then I would reconsider this option.
1,17517,4283,17103,No, as CAMHS nurse specifically said do not
1,17518,4273,17126,Get police to go and make a statement from victims mother to have an official record of the incident, and see if police can gather any evidence (CCTV) to see if Paul was involved or not
1,17519,4271,17100,Jake must be spoken to regarding this incident. Although there is no direct evidence. There is clearly an underlying problem and this needs to be dealt with. The matter should be brought to the attention of local neighbourhood officers.
1,17520,4283,17123,10
1,17521,4271,17101,5
1,17522,4283,17124,10
1,17523,4270,17123,8.  There are many variables and consultations that need to occur, especially if this could be detrimental to his mental health.
1,17524,4283,17125,8
1,17525,4270,17124,10
1,17526,4270,17125,10
1,17527,4273,17518,In addition, check with Police if Paul has an alibi for the time of the incident.
1,17528,4278,17103,Yes; regardless of what the CAMHS nurse suggests I think it would benefit Derek to enroll in the problem.  It might give him new ideas or it might deter further behavior, one can never know.  However, the program appears to fairly successful in stopping later firestarting behavior.  So, I say, have at it.
1,17529,4278,17123,10
1,17530,4284,17103,No because I believe that his firesetting behaviour is the result of conflict resolution issues which can be addressed in other ways. Also, I believe that the nurse should be allowed to disclose the information pertaining to Dereks mental health with the YOT officer in order to better facilitate care for Derek. However, due to her caution, I would not place him on the course. I would instead focus therapy on better resolutions to conflict and increase monitoring of Derek to prevent future problems with fire or anything else
1,17531,4278,17124,6
1,17532,4278,17125,5
1,17533,4284,17123,1
1,17534,4269,17103,Yes.  Needs to be made aware of the seriousness of his behaviour, the consequences if he were to set another fire are too great to risk.  High success rate of programme, not sure due to lack of previous records whether he has previously displayed arson behaviour and this may be a problem pattern of behaviour that should be addressed.  Concerned about input from CAMHS nurse, but without knowing the specifics I would suggest that it is better to look at the consequences in terms of the risk to other people
1,17535,4284,17124,7
1,17536,4284,17125,5
1,17537,4283,17126,telephone to girlfriends mother, advice she informs the police but tell her that without evidence YOT can not address this particular issue.
1,17538,4273,17103,Yes
1,17539,4278,17126,Have Paul pay for the damages to the window.
1,17540,4271,17103,Yes.<br />The resaerch tells us that there could be a second incident within 3 months. There needs to be a discussion with his Mental Health nurse as soon as possible. I would like to explore the reasons why, such a course would have a detrimental affect.
1,17541,4273,17123,4
1,17542,4278,17126,Some kind of incarceration, even if it&#039;s just 24 hours
1,17543,4271,17103,10
1,17544,4270,17126,Need to meet with Paul and confront him about the brick through the window.  If evidence arises or he admits that it was him, need to discuss reparition for the cost of the window and determine if additional charges should/will be filed.  Was the incident fueled by alcohol?  Are the victim and Paul still in contact through friends, etc?
1,17545,4273,17124,10
1,17546,4269,17123,8.  Difficult to make the right decision without knowing his full background.  Would need to try and find out why the CAMHS nurse felt it would be detrimental to his mental health, what aspects of the programme would be likely to affect him
1,17547,4270,17127,7
1,17548,4283,17126,discuss with paul how he is feeling towards his ex girlfriend if he gives any indication that he was behind this incident inform the police.
1,17549,4283,17127,8
1,17550,4278,17126,Community service cleaning up litter on the roads and sidewalks
1,17551,4278,17127,8
1,17552,4273,17127,4
1,17553,4283,17101,6
1,17554,4283,17102,4
1,17555,4271,17123,5. This is of such importance that it should involve a number of agencies.
1,17556,4273,17101,4
1,17557,4269,17124,8: the consequences of sending him on the programme and damaging his mental health are great for Derek, and of not sending him and others being put at risk by not sending him also
1,17558,4284,17126,I would advise the victim&#039;s mother to take other precautions and to take special notice of anything out of the ordinary. I would not approach Paul on this matter as the police cannot arrest him for his actions as there is no prove. However, I would advise the victim to not be alone when outside her house and to change her routines as much as possible. Finally, I would start making enquirings into having Paul placed in a care facility for violent offenders if this situation continues. I would approach his sister to discuss possible means of intervention with her
1,17559,4271,17124,10
1,17560,4269,17125,9, due to potential serious consequences either way
1,17561,4271,17125,8
1,17562,4271,17125,8
1,17563,4273,17125,9
1,17564,4284,17127,7
1,17565,4270,17100,This report needs further review.  Without any specific information or incidents, it is hard to determine an appropriate course of action.  I would, based solely on this, bring Jake in for a chat about his behavior and to see if he is intentionally being a nuisance or if, simply because he is young and known to have previously been in trouble, is viewed as threatening.
1,17566,4273,17102,4
1,17567,4270,17101,4
1,17568,4270,17102,5
1,17569,4269,17126,Refer the matter to police, continued harrassment of victim needs to be flagged with the appropriate agencies as it could further escalate.  They would at least be able to investigate whether it was actually him who threw the brick
1,17570,4284,17128,6
1,17571,4269,17127,7: if harrassment continues, could have severe consequences for victim, who has already suffered injuries from the first attack
1,17572,4273,17128,4
1,17573,4283,17128,7
1,17574,4271,17126,Paul should be spoken to. There is no evidence he is responsible for the damage. However, he should be reminded of the restrictions upon him. He should also be advised of any outcomes that would follow should he carry out such an act. Lynn should be advised of the decision.
1,17575,4269,17128,6
1,17576,4283,17128,6
1,17577,4271,17127,5
1,17578,4271,17128,2
1,17579,4284,17126,consider alcohol and drug abbuse treatment centres
1,17580,4269,17129,Assault should be reported to police due to possible hate crime implications
1,17581,4273,17129,Make press release. Do not mention individual cases, but give details of procedures put in place to protect youths and members of the public.
1,17582,4270,17132,Well, since I obviously made the wrong decision, the matter seems to have been taken out of my hands.  He is in custody and has killed another child and I will be lucky if I have a job tomorrow since the decision to send him to the firesetting program was left to me!
1,17583,4271,17129,This is confirmation that the assault on Yusef should have been reported. The mother of the complainant is progessing this. The issue of him being a racist needs to be progressed - what is the evidence?
1,17584,4270,17133,10
1,17585,4278,17129,Switch Jake to another program;
1,17586,4270,17134,10
1,17587,4283,17129,t/c to yp&#039;s mother, explain that it YOT policy that yp&#039;s attend reparation in groups. Advice her that if she feels her son was assulted by another yp her son should immeadtley inform the police and press charges.
1,17588,4271,17130,5
1,17589,4269,17130,7: if it turns out to be a hate crime, could escalate in future incidences, police and courts need to be aware
1,17590,4271,17131,7
1,17591,4278,17129,Have Jake issue an apology to Isuf
1,17592,4269,17131,7
1,17593,4283,17130,4
1,17594,4278,17130,4
1,17595,4283,17131,3
1,17596,4278,17131,1
1,17597,4283,17131,3
1,17598,4283,17131,3
1,17599,4284,17129,Interview Jake and find out why he was not forced to go on the treatment program and why supervision was not increased. Call the nurse back and discuss options with her now that the situation is likely to have escalated. Also discuss with her sending Jake on the course and possible ramifications. Place Jake in a 24 hour secure unit and insist on therapy and treatment being provided.
1,17600,4284,17130,4
1,17601,4269,17135,Report continued harrassment to police, and threats in text messages.  Potential to escalate into stalking situation, police need to be aware so that protection of victim issues can be addressed
1,17602,4284,17131,5
1,17603,4278,17132,Well, there&#039;s not really much you can do as Derek is now dead.  I guess the next step would be some serious PR on the part of the foster service.
1,17604,4278,17133,6
1,17605,4284,17129,Sorry, this is for Derek
1,17606,4278,17134,4
1,17607,4273,17135,Again contact police in relation to breach of contact order.
1,17608,4269,17136,8: level of threat implied in text messages shold be taken seriously in the light of the attack the victim has already received, which was only stopped because her friends were able to help
1,17609,4273,17135,Pass on text messages to police as evidence.
1,17610,4271,17132,What were the reasons behind the suicide? What was it about the course that caused Derek&#039;s reaction? Was it picked up by any of the staff or other students on the course. Has the inter agency meeting with his nurse taken place we should have been alerted to this problem.
1,17611,4271,17133,8
1,17612,4278,17135,Have Paul brought up on charges of stalking and voyeurism
1,17613,4283,17132,inform police if they haven&#039;t been informed already, derek is likely to be remanded, if he turns up at the yot office advice him to turn himself into the police, t/c police and inform them he is in yot office if needed for questioning. do not discuss offence with him as not convicted yet
1,17614,4283,17133,7
1,17615,4273,17135,Give contact numbers to victim for domestic violence type agencies.
1,17616,4271,17134,7
1,17617,4283,17134,5
1,17618,4269,17137,5: reporting to police is better than possible regret of not doing so with potential consequences for victim
1,17619,4284,17132,Ok, my answers for Jake refer to Derek and vice versa I would discuss Jake&#039;s actions with his family, school, reparations staff and Jake and enter him into an anger management and cinflict resolution program that he attends with his parents. I would make him apologise to the victim and address his racism in therapy
1,17620,4278,17135,Have Paul placed in some kind of treatment center for juveniles or send him to a juvenile prison
1,17621,4284,17134,6
1,17622,4278,17136,6
1,17623,4278,17137,8
1,17624,4284,17133,6
1,17625,4270,17129,Need to meet with Isuf and determine severity of injuries and also to determine if he was &quot;hit over nothing&quot; or if there was some sort of instigation present.  Also need to meet with the mother and get her to calm down and discuss the matter rationally.  Obviously, her child is no angel if he is also in reparition.  Also need to determine if there is a genuine sense of racist attitudes on Jake&#039;s behalf.<br />Additionally need to talk to Reparition Team to determine if Jake can feasibly continue his reparition there and if he can be separated from Isuf for the duration.  Also need to get background on the boys&#039; relationship.  Had there been previous conflict, and if so, why had the boys been paired?<br />Finally, need to determine if charges will be filed and/or how this impacts his sentence.
1,17626,4283,17135,contact police straight away, if he turns up at yot office inform police he is there.
1,17627,4270,17130,7
1,17628,4270,17131,5
1,17629,4283,17135,advice joanne to go to the police straight away
1,17630,4269,17132,Participate fully in inquiry, try to establish whether feeling over fire setting programme were to blame
1,17631,4283,17136,9
1,17632,4273,17129,wrong bit, meant to be in Derek
1,17633,4283,17137,8
1,17634,4269,17133,5: important to know the circumstances leading up to the suicide and what factors may have been responsible
1,17635,4284,17135,Arrest him and place him in a system where he can get access to therapy and treatment focused on victim empathy and anger management, involve him in work or training that will improve his self esteem and involvement in the community, drugs and alcohol rehabilitation program
1,17636,4284,17136,8
1,17637,4284,17137,6
1,17638,4271,17135,Paul has to be advised that a complaint has been made. There is clear evidence of harassment. If this is taken forward he could end up before the courts. Further, the type of language being used by him is totally inappropriate and he should refrain from further contact with Joanne.
1,17639,4283,17129,inform her that serious violent offenders are not mixed with low risk offenders for reparation
1,17640,4271,17136,5
1,17641,4273,17129,Contact Mrs. Williams to arrange a meeting with her and her son to talk about incident. Inform her that police were called and everything possible was done to manage the incident.
1,17642,4271,17137,3
1,17643,4273,17133,10
1,17644,4273,17130,4

1,17646,4273,17131,2
1,17647,4273,17134,10
1,17648,4273,17137,7
1,17649,4270,17135,Would also like to look at the texts the victim is sending to Jake, as that one text asking if she would like to meet up is a bit odd among the lot.  Also need to document all texts and then call Jake in to discuss them.  Need to consult with supervisor as to next appropriate action.  The threats to the victim are intensifying and pose a serious problem.  Further penalties for this behavior are needed.
1,17650,4270,17136,9
1,17651,4270,17137,6
1,17652,4269,17138,Report assault on Yusuf to police due to pattern of hate crimes, previous convictions mostly against people of other ethnicities, pattern needs to be stopped if possible
1,17653,4269,17139,5: reasonably low level offences so far, needs to be flagged before anything escalates
1,17654,4278,17138,I&#039;d send him to juvenile prison until 18.  After his sentence, he&#039;d be placed on probation, indefinitely or until socially appropriate behavior is observed, during which he would be court ordered to attend classes on race equality.
1,17655,4278,17139,7
1,17656,4283,17138,discuss issues of racism with jake start to do offence focussed work and look into why these issues- is it group racism-where are these believes coming from. explian seriousness of further offending also what may happen if he starts to target specfic gangs regarding race ie-risk to harm for  himself.
1,17657,4278,17140,7
1,17658,4278,17141,Again, issues of PR
1,17659,4283,17138,look into risk of any other yp&#039;s that he maybe attending reparation with or any other activities, endsure staff know about these issues and can be aware of possible behaviour
1,17660,4271,17138,The antecedence of Jake indicate that his crimes are of a racist nature. The assault on Yusef and the behaviour towards Mr Patel, is further confirmation of this. There is a great deal of work to be done with this lad to steer him away from this behaviour. Prosecution for the assault offence will be a way of progressing this work.
1,17661,4284,17138,Place him in a madatory treatment program that is focused on his racism. Provide him with rewards for his behaviour and get him to undergo cognitive therapy that examines the source of his racial tendencies. Discuss this situation with the family. Therapy should include ingroup activites that include clinicians of various ethnic and racial backgrounds. Explain to Jake that his behaviour is likely to end in his criminal incarceration.

1,17677,4270,17141,Need to meet with supervisor and explain decision made.  There was no evidence of previous firesetting in records available (problems in getting previous records documented in care profile) and the first incident appeared anger-driven.  Need to prepare a formal apology and press release stating that, due to the information available, it was felt that the first, and only, fire set by Derek at Sanford House was deemed relatively minor and not indicative of firesetting behavior.  We are incredibly sorry and that our hearts go out to the family of the girl who was killed.  Derek is a very disturbed young man.  And I am still not sure this meeting with the line supervisor is not him getting ready to fire me!

1,17698,4284,17141,Explain to my supervisor that the CAMHS nurse warned me against sending Derek on the arson program. Explain that overall we need better communication and record sharing between agencies to adequately address the concerns of the child. Provide evidence that increased supervision was recommended for Derek and also therapy that addressed his firesetting behaviour (other than the course) and that Derek was not made to attend this therapy. Discuss the possibilities now on how to deal with Derek and placing him in a constant supervision ward and making sure he receives the therapy.

1,17716,4273,17139,8
1,17717,4270,17409,Until Turn 4, there was no clear indication, other than supposition, that his crimes were racially motivated.  Also, there was no concrete information regarding current behavior around local shops and the incident at reparition was vague in details, as well.
1,17718,4283,17409,to address offending behaviour. No information on offences that have not been through the courts can be discussed, so would always advice others to take  matter up with the police.
1,17719,4273,17409,I based my decisions on the information I had at the time. There were no withnesses to the incident, so I could not be totally sure that it actually happened. I feel all I could do is officially document everybodies version of events.
1,17720,4283,17409,warning must be given for unacceptable behaviour on reparation
1,17721,4269,17409,Potential worrying trend of behaviour developing, particularly the hate crime aspect.  I felt that sanctions needed to be imposed on the lower-level offences to try and prevent escalation to more serious offences, with the potential consequences these may have for future victims.  If there was an escalation, I felt it was important that it was documented that interventions were made early on
1,17722,4283,17409,obviously important issues surrounding racism which need to be address and the importance3 of informing other staff who need to be aware
1,17723,4271,17409,The evidence showed that Jake was targetting ethnic people. His antecedence showed that there was a patern in relation to again people of an ethnic background. There was a need to take positive action in respect of his behaviour. The complainants need confirmation that this type of crime will be pursued.
1,17724,4284,17409,I feel that Jake&#039;s behaviour can be effectively handled with his family and school and therapy. I don&#039;t feel that involving him in the criminal justice system will help to address his problems. However, as his behaviour continues to increase in frequency and violence, the time for effective treatment is, in my opinion, vanishing. Therefore, I think that Jake should be prevented from participating in activites he enjoys unless his behaviour improves. I feel that through ingroup counseling and itherapy Jake&#039;s racism can be addressed and hopefully eliminated
1,17725,4278,17409,Because Jake obviously cannot function among a racially diverse society.  His repeat offending behavior signal that he is in need of serious judiciary intervention.  Since he has yet to see the &quot;error of his ways,&quot; I say give him a long stay in a juvenile detention center to sort things out to his content.  A continuing relationship with probationary services would to well to cull some of his criminal behavior.
1,17726,4273,17410,I felt that that someone was going to be harmed, either Derek himself or a member of the public. I felt I had to make a choice between these two outcomes. I did feel some regret that I had not listened to the mental health professional.
1,17727,4283,17410,made decision because cahms nurse gave specific information not to send YP on course, you would assume they had a detailed knowledge of the mental health of this yp and would not advice this unless a serious risk to yp
1,17728,4269,17410,Again, I felt it was important to consider the safety of the public in trying to stop a worrying trend of behaviour.  The first arson incident, setting fire to his bed in the care home, could have caused serious injury or death, and I felt it was important that this possibility be averted if at all possible, and the programme appeared to have a high success level
1,17729,4271,17410,My line manager placed the decision on me. In view of the success of FISP and the potential that Derek was likely to re-offend, I believed that it was appropriate to place him on such a course.
1,17730,4278,17410,Well, because a juvenile died, essentially, in the care of the state, it is now the job of the foster center to ensure that it receives no undue or too harsh a backlash from the incident
1,17731,4270,17410,This one was tough.  Derek is obviously a deeply troubled kid who has issues with anger and impulsivity.  In addition, the lack of a full case file probably greatly hindered decision-making, especially if there was evidence of previous firesetting behavior missing.  The incidents where information was available (the assault on the care worker and the fire on his bed) seemed relatively minor and akin to temper tantrums.  Due to his fragile mental state, the seriousness of known actions, and the recommendation from his mental health nurse, I opted to err on what I thought was the side of caution as far as he was concerned.

2,17781,4287,0,DEREK2:Importance?
1,17735,4284,17410,I feel that Derek did not have specific firesetting desires but more that this was a way of relieving frustration and resolving conflict. Thus, I made the decision not to send him on the fire prevention course but instead to place him in intense therapy and address his conflict resolution and anger management. However, supervision should have been increased following his bed being set on fire. I feel now the situation with Derek requires more drastic interventiuon such as 24 hour monitoring facilities and more long term therapy to address not only his problems but also to address the harm his actions have on others.

1,18105,4340,17957,(2) Get further info from Camhs nurse as to why she thinks unwise to proceed with referral-ask her to put it in writing.

I would like Camhs to take it to a professionals meeting and share responsibility
1,18106,4347,17957,see previous comments on jake
1,18107,4348,17957,Yes.  I would call a risk management meeting - to potentially look at a MAPPA if deemed appropriate at this meeting.  At the initial risk management meeting I would discuss that in order to fully assess risk of harm to himself ant the community information needs to be shared.  I would argue that in order to not send Derek on the fire setters programme we would need to understand how it would be detremental to his mental health, and also look at an alternative plan to address risk to himself and others.  This would also include looking at specific roles and responsibilities across agencies, to try and ensure that if he has mental health problems he recieves apropriate support. I would also invite the firesetters team to allow them to fully expalin the programme to involved professionals.

1,18390,4372,17859,No. According to Mental Health worker course not appropriate for Derek, stand by her professional decision. T/C MHW find out what type of intervention would be more appropriate for Derek.
1,18391,4369,17862,9
1,18392,4367,17865,No action against Paul as there is no evidence of his involvement.  Advise the victim to report the matter to Police.
1,18393,4362,17856,Interview Jake re incident. Speak to Isuf and his mum.  Based on the evidence available it will be possible to decide weather he has breached his Order and if so matter should be sent to Court.

1,18398,4369,17864,4
1,18399,4371,17859,NO<br />Not at this time; would want more than a phone message from CAHMS nurse before making such a decision; would also look at what other resources / interventions may benefit Derek in relation to this behaviour.<br />Discuss it with colleagues as manager has left it up to me
1,18400,4370,17855,Contact victims mum requesting a meeting. Advise mum that a complaint should be made to the police.<br />Liaise with reparation worker to research 1-2-1 reparation for Jake taking him off group activities.<br />Put in place appropriate racist incident processes.
1,18401,4372,17862,2
1,18402,4361,17859,No. Programme is not appropriate in all cases and  if relationship with health staff has been good and reliable in the past would look at further evidence to support decision if necessary.
1,18403,4362,17856,5
1,18404,4372,17863,8
1,18405,4360,17860,case worker- they should have info onthe yp from a range of people &amp; know the yp best.

1,18411,4370,17858,1
1,18412,4371,17860,I would want to share the decision with my line manager, as case manager I have a better knowledge and understanding of the young person and the line manager can take a more strategic perspective
1,18413,4360,17863,5
1,18414,4362,17858,1
1,18415,4373,17860,myself as case manager however i would justify my decision to case manager, if the firesetters prevention programme is managed sensitively given some of the mental health concerns and review after every session then this could well manage the concerns raised.  derek has 2 incidents of fire setting behaviour already which need to be addressed if not for his own safety then for the safety of others esp. within the care home environment. liasion with camhs re. further information necessary

1,18420,4361,17860,Line Manager/Head of Serivice in terms of risk (Risk Review process)
1,18421,4364,17859,No<br />The metal health nurse who has information must have a good reason to ask that he not be included and until such time that perhaps the info may be shared then it would not be suitable for him to attend. Not sure of practice but may call meeting so that that info can be given
1,18422,4371,17863,9

1,18426,4361,17862,1
1,18427,4369,17865,Speak direct to Police Officer investigating case or his manager. Speak to LASBU. Pull in Paul and give warning. Any forthcoming Court matters relating to this offence look for conditions. Advise Mum to help her daughter live elsewhere
1,18428,4363,17859,at this stage i would not make a direct referral into the programme as i would like to gather further information into the effects it could have on Derek&#039;s mental health.  i would refer to any specialist reports completed on Derek which may give ideas of why he is firesetting.  Derek&#039;s fire setting seems to be confind to the care home at this stage therefore it can be managed internally by them following there own policy and procedures.  Derek&#039;s reasons for fire setting may mean that a different intervention is needed which tackles the reason behind the fire setting it may be that fire setting is not the problem.  the programme&#039;s to refer onto are not suitable for all young people and i would not be swayed to put a young perosn on a programme if it is inappropriate just because they have a lack of young people on the programme.
1,18429,4369,17865,8
1,18430,4372,17865,Report to YOS Police. Speak to Lynne, speak/discuss with Paul. No evidence to suggest it was Paul, was not observed by anyone. Update YOIS, ROSH, case diary&#039;s.

1,18437,4365,17865,Lynne, Joannes mum called to say a brick has been thrown through the window.  She did not see the perpetrator but believes it to be Paul Johnson.  She is very concerned.

1,18442,4363,17860,the case manager should be responsible as they hold the key information on the young person however a collaboration between YOT officer and line manager would be advisable

1,18454,4371,17865,Ask victim liason workers to liase with victim - as I would feel I may have some unconcious offender bias. Try to see if some form of restorative justice would help Paul understand where they are coming from, and also allow Paul to express his feelings in a &quot;safer&quot; way.<br />Discuss it with Paul - alert him to the risks he is putting himself at - there is also no direct evidence<br />Report the matter to line manager

1,18609,4365,17881,Simon, senior manager on the phone, crapping himself over the death of derek.  If he had offered advice and guidance, which is what he is paid for I  ( I stress I) would not be in this position.  I will be the fall guy.  Anyway see what he has to say at the meeting.

1,18629,4373,17878,suspected pattern of racially aggravated incidents confirmed by pre cons.  intervention already in place in terms fo challening racist attitudes and behaviour, some mediation between Jake and representatives of his targetted communities may be a powerful way of changing attitudes for the better if appropriate in terms of mediation / timing.  if Jake not responding to the above work then ongoing risk management meetings will inform what other safeguards need to be put in place to avoide further racially motivated harm being caused

1,18701,4367,17887,Decision based on fact and discussions
1,18702,4372,17887,From information provided and time had to make decision.
1,18703,4367,17888,Decision justified unfortuntate circumstances regarding the incident
1,18704,4371,17887,Based on the information available to me at the time, and previous experience  - felt that they were the right ones at the right time
1,18705,4365,17888,I felt dreadful, that I may have been the cause of his death.  However, I felt I made the right decision with the info given.  Cahms should have been more frank and my line manager should b=have been there to offer support and guidance.
1,18706,4369,17887,What is the motive for this offending? Reparation worker and victim on rep. have names which would suggest non-white
1,18707,4373,17887,based on information and suspicions I had and also Jake&#039;s engagement levels re. the interventions he was subject to, also and perhaps most importantly to safeguard his victims, the communities his offending targets
1,18708,4372,17888,FElt bad, however my decision was made on dirction of MH worker and after speaking to Line Manager.
1,18709,4370,17887,Based on the information available to me at any given time.<br />To protect any potential victims.<br />To address the offending behaviour.
1,18710,4369,18706,Steve Boote
1,18711,4367,17889,Based on consultation with Line Manager, CAMHS , ASSET scores, and being the Case Manager
1,18712,4362,17887,No conviction for racist offence but evidence to suggest he was involved in racially aggravated anti-social behaviour.
1,18713,4360,17887,decisions were made- initially to give yp a chance but by part 3 it was clear the yp&#039;s offending was realted to racism. RJ was suggested 1. For the victims to move on2. to try &amp; engender some empathy and responsibility in Jake.
1,18714,4372,17889,Information from MH worker and Line Manager
1,18715,4363,17887,my decisions were to take enforcement action where necessary to enforce the current work being undertaken by YOT.  My advice to contact the police was so that they could build up a picture of Jake&#039;s behaviour and arrest if necessary the information recived didnt directly relate to his order it wasn&#039;t in detail but perhaps outlined a pattern of behaviour.
1,18716,4365,17889,I felt it was appropriate, the FISP programme was a suitable intervention tool
1,18717,4367,17890,Based on information supplied.
1,18718,4364,17888,When I saw this report felt  dreadful  and saddened as I perhaps could have done something more to prevent this incident. Would My actions have stoped it or could I have made more effort in supporting this young man.
1,18719,4371,17888,I was gutted; however can&#039;t decide if I made the right decision, because in the other senario he died. Felt that I had possibly been manipulated
1,18720,4372,17890,Based on information I had.
1,18721,4367,17891,David Ashton
1,18722,4373,17888,sadness re. what had happened
1,18723,4372,17891,Marie
1,18724,4364,17889,At the time and with the information I had thought that it was the right decision to make
1,18725,4371,17889,Placed trust in another professionals opinion, and followed their expert advice
1,18726,4372,18702,Mulit agency response
1,18727,4370,17888,I should have been firmer in responding to my own assessment, concerns and gut instinct.<br />Devastaed that someone lost their life.
1,18728,4369,17888,bloody Councillors<br />Steve Boote
1,18729,4373,17889,knowledge that the decision i made were defensible in the face of scrutiny and that thorough reasoning / information sharing took place to inform the decision I made which were to reduce serious harm to others from further fire setting taking place by derek, the course was designed specifically and sensitively to do this.
1,18730,4363,17888,my thoughts and feelings were that i had made a defensiable decision based on information available to me at the time.
1,18731,4371,17890,Tried to stop the harrassment - felt that this was the best course to do so.
1,18732,4360,17888,Initially shock at the terrible occurrence and fear that I would be blamed! However I quickly thought that we were in agreement with health parctitioner &amp; that his attending the programme would not necessarily have changed the outcome
1,18733,4364,17846,To engage at intervention stage to address offending behaviour and look at racial issues in past
1,18734,4365,17887,The pre cons gave more insight into Jakes offending and proved there was a rasist element to his offending.  Sending  him on race awareness and difference and diversity courses was also appropriate
1,18735,4364,17887,Obvious need
1,18736,4371,17891,Lauren Elliott
1,18737,4369,17889,difficult to argue with such an assertive medical statement which will have more clout in Court
1,18738,4373,17890,to safegaurd the victim first and foremost but also to help Paul move on with his life and let go of the past in terms of the parallel intervention he himself was subject to which dovetailed with the risk management plan regarding him and the concerns that were clearly evident
1,18739,4370,17889,I felt that the CAMHS worker had more professional knowledge in this area and now realise i should have made it a MAPPA issue.
1,18740,4363,17889,due to information available on ASSET and call from CAMHS felt that the programme was not appropriate
1,18741,4373,17891,Steve
1,18742,4369,17890,Domestic Violence and repeat victimisation are integral and need robust prevention measures
1,18743,4362,17888,Did I record the conversation with Lisa Cookson in which she specifically instructed me not to refer Derek to FISP. Even though I can defend my decision will I be made a scapegoat?  Will the psych accept her role?
1,18744,4364,17890,Dealt with situation with victim first and then taken back to the offender. eased situation rather than aggravated
1,18745,4369,17891,Steve Boote
1,18746,4373,17891,Steve
1,18747,4364,17891,Janet Grace
1,18748,4365,17890,This was escallating and could have gotten out of control, resulting in violent attack or even death.
1,18749,4360,17889,my &#039;gut&#039; feeling as that the arson programme was targeting a different type of offender. This opinion was strengthened by the nurse. Sometimes programmes are promoted for the wrong reason &amp; to be effective the right people have to be on them at the right time
1,18750,4370,17890,To protent the current and any future victims.
1,18751,4363,17890,i would advise any person to contact the police about an offence
1,18752,4365,17891,Ann Physick
1,18753,4362,17889,Psych is an expert in her field and I would accept her assessment of the situation at that time.
1,18754,4363,17891,Lisa Furby
1,18755,4370,17891,Eddie Patterson
1,18756,4361,17887,To clarify info received and to ascertain adequate management in the future. Would need to see history in terms of breach action as to next steps. Also that the victim was aware of right to report to the Police.
1,18757,4361,17888,The press does not offer accurate details as to the offence or the offender. Neither would his attendance at the arson programme have prevented the offence from happening.
1,18758,4360,17890,this was more difficult as I din&#039;t catch some bits! Decisios were based upon the high probability that Paul&#039;s behaviour was likely to continue, present greater risk and that while the YOT could deal with some parts, extra external suport nedded
1,18759,4360,17891,Gaynor
2,18760,4386,0,What do you think about long haul flights?

1,18792,4424,18785,Lrgfer Budget...Reruit staff/actors who can perform to higher standards
1,18793,4417,18785,it should go back to the old format of Doctor Who, the acting was better as they did not rely so much on special effects.
1,18794,4412,18784,Proper actors
1,18795,4415,18783,&#039;nanny should have credibility enhanced by being someone who has had children of their own

1,18800,4419,18778,I hope to get detailed knowledge of areas I am interested in and to develop knowledge from previously studied fields.
1,18801,4414,18778,I hope this course will provide me with a good throughout of knowledge in forensic setting which will be useful towards becoming forensic psychologist
1,18802,4424,18778,Students:- will act in a professional manner and take an &#039;team&#039; approach to the process

1,18815,4412,18778,The course should be interesting and be more engaging than the undergraduate degree, especially as the class numbers are so small to give a detailed understanding of forensic psychology
1,18816,4424,18778,The course will be challenging and though provoking, stimulating new ideas and avenues of ideas
1,18817,4408,18801,What would you like this knowledge to include?
1,18818,4418,18778,to fall in love?

1,18820,4408,18803,Which aspects?
1,18821,4424,18813,to assist the writer of this coment to fully detox before his/her dissertation is due
1,18822,4408,18819,What practical stuff would you like?
1,18823,4418,18820,the geographical side on forensic psych
1,18824,4424,18813,The staff will be approachable and supportive. Facilitating the learning process and course as a whole
1,18825,4419,18805,Criminal behaviour, victim reactions to crimes/ preperations for court/ follow up care (particularly children going through legal processes), youth offending/ rehabillitation/ community YOT programmes
1,18826,4418,18821,no chance
1,18827,4408,18810,How are you going to do this?
1,18828,4424,18778,To engage with the MSc Investigative students (i.e those currently in the filed of police work etc..)
1,18829,4419,18812,Areas on interview discourse would be good
1,18830,4415,18807,Would like opportunity for networking with MSc on Critical Incident Students to be programmed formally to ensure that opportunity to trade practical experience for psychological theory will not be wasted
1,18831,4408,18828,How are you going to do this?
1,18832,4424,18780,I will engage fully, pre-reading for every lecture and attmpt to bring life experince to the forum
1,18833,4418,18827,by writing and practicing essay and style and format
1,18834,4415,18830,I hope staff will notice this suggestion and arrange it ... to answer your question!
1,18835,4419,18829,Also on interviewing vulnerable groups and particularly police approach to such interviews
1,18836,4416,18830,I agree - some sort of interface would be good.
1,18837,4424,18831,by networking and interaction, pre-post lectures
1,18838,4414,18778,apart from investigative tools that will be covered from the course, i&#039;d like to critically analyse them and to understand their weaknesses and how to develop a better model.
1,18839,4418,18827,i expect the staff to be helpfull supportive and understanding with problems that may arise
1,18840,4419,18818,With the course?!
1,18841,4418,18778,i expect the staff to be helpfull supportive and understanding with problems that may arise
1,18842,4413,18822,carrying out tests. actually going through procedures for eg. rehabilitation. on my last course it was always talked about how to do it but never put in practice. i think experiencing it is important
1,18843,4424,18805,Youth Crime and Delinquency
1,18844,4416,18830,staff to be approachable and relatively informal (not as distant as undergrad)
1,18845,4424,18805,Serious Crime and Covert Operations (data/survailence)
1,18846,4417,18778,expect the staff to be welcoming and engaging in their research. To help guide some of us who are not  too sure which area they want to further in! To enthuse us to further our knowledge by doing an extra 6 hours of research after their 1 hour with us!
1,18847,4418,18836,i concur
1,18848,4417,18779,how to critique a book in 1500 words!!
1,18849,4418,18779,financal concerns!!!!
1,18850,4419,18779,Concern of working even a part time job with the amount of out of hours study time needed
1,18851,4424,18779,Support in finding possible careers will not be forthcomming
1,18852,4418,18779,stats!
1,18853,4417,18779,that i wont have a life as i will be reading so much!
1,18854,4413,18779,concerned that i could fall behind. find the course particularly tough
1,18855,4424,18848,I can help u! dont worry
1,18856,4414,18779,essay writing and future career
1,18857,4424,18848,That fellow students will not be motivated
1,18858,4418,18779,the library closing at 8!!!
1,18859,4412,18779,Concerns about the forthcoming year mostly include the vast workload and coping with it all, fear of falling behind
1,18860,4417,18848,thank you! It is the one task that seems daunting at the moment as i have never done it before
1,18861,4418,18853,make the time to socialise it as important as study just like a balanced diet
1,18862,4417,18858,how much time do you need?!
1,18863,4416,18779,workspace - where to do our assignment work, spread out books etc, individual space available at uni. lockers etc to store books or do we have to bring them to and from home every day?
1,18864,4419,18779,Concerns about the first essay being wrote the department not being practice on but actually counting towards mark, when we dont know the style that is expected. Would be better perhaps to have written a small piece that didnt contribute for feedback but this would mean greater staff working - harder on them and us as more work but probabaly helpful
1,18865,4418,18854,ask your new peers to help you out work as a team
1,18866,4418,18862,24 hours and a place to sleep sometimes!
1,18867,4424,18779,The marking style of the &#039;markers&#039;, if a clash of ideas could leade to a reduced mark. Due to being different from BSc standards..?
1,18868,4416,18779,where to from here - finding out about opportunities/roles in this field.
1,18869,4415,18853,establishing an effective balance between in depth research/reading and the overall development of knowledge for the course as a whole - ie keeping a healthy sense of persective that is both challenging and rewarding
1,18870,4417,18854,work within your group to talk about concerns as many may be strugling with the same essay/topic, by talking together may help things make sense?
1,18871,4414,18858,are we going to be assigned a personal tutor?
1,18872,4424,18779,Not being able to attend social events due to the distance I live from Uni.. ;-)
1,18873,4419,18866,I totally agree, I used my undergrad library until like midnight most nights and its v.helpful!
1,18874,4418,18853,thats il get last one standing on a night out cause no one can keep up (this has not been written by an irish person)
1,18875,4416,18864,can we submit drafts to the lecturers for feedback before handing in?
1,18876,4415,18869,yes i agree - guidance of staff on this would be useful
1,18877,4418,18871,and a person trainer
1,18878,4424,18862,24/7 libary! use the internet..journals are more importan that books!
1,18879,4419,18875,That would be good
1,18880,4418,18871,that you wont get feed back before final submission of a piece of work!!!
1,18881,4418,18779,that you wont get feed back before final submission of a piece of work!!!
1,18882,4424,18867,How to fix:- giving examples of good/bad essays, as provided is good and a clear section in the handbook would be good. I.e what is a 80%  mark, content, what it provides etc...
1,18883,4413,18872,u could make friend here and crash on thier floor
1,18884,4417,18875,i think that would be a good idea, as some people may not have studied in a while so may need extra guidance
1,18885,4415,18853,a course notice board for student feedback on useful books/chapters/refs etc - to support each other
1,18886,4418,18872,arrange a party in your place il come!

1,18923,4415,18914,I too am particularly interested in trying to contribute to improving police policy/practice which appears to be highly variable in some areas not least in obtaining best evidence
1,18924,4424,18911,me 2 im a power point guru!
1,18925,4418,18919,im interested in legal aspects hopefully you can point out legal issues along the way

1,18927,4415,18919,I would like to learn more from you because the legal side is of considerable interest to me.
1,18928,4418,18911,not power point as such more in style deliveray and content

1,18933,4429,18901,Corronation Street. Because its so absolutely bland
1,18934,4437,18901,Antiques road show<br />Its boring and you only get old people on there
1,18935,4439,18901,trinny and susannah, absolute trash, they are hags themselves!
1,18936,4436,18933,better actors and story lines
1,18937,4438,18930,cancel it
1,18938,4429,18930,Put more normal people in the house
1,18939,4437,18930,Give them more tasks
1,18940,4430,18930,I would ban it from the tv, it&#039;s been complete trash since the first one

1,18942,4439,18931,enter into the spirit of things and pretend you like football!
1,18943,4440,18930,I do not really know!
1,18944,4441,18904,expect everyone to be quite helpful although not wrap us in cotton wool so we have to work hard at the course. Also eexpect there to be some good supervisors in very interesting areas for the dissertations that will further our knowledge greatly in different areas
1,18945,4429,18904,To have a deeper understanding of the importance between the investigation of forensic psychology and how this is used practically by the police and prison services
1,18946,4430,18904,I expect the course to be incredible hard but also very rewarding. I hope that there will be oportunities to explore a range of fields in order to really choose what to specialise in for my dissertation.
1,18947,4427,18944,What areas would you be interested in?
1,18948,4438,18904,In-depth knowledge of interesting subjects, delivered by people who are enthusiastic and willing to impart their knowledge onto us.
1,18949,4427,18944,What should a &quot;good&quot; supervisor do?
1,18950,4436,18904,Good and thorough knowledge of the subject areas. Good stats knowledge used in the field, e.g. SSA&#039;s.<br />Availability and  punctuality of staff members. Good applicability of their expertese.<br />Encouraging the production of good work that could be submitted for publication.<br />Friendly students and people on the course.<br />Guidance through where to go next and how to do it.
1,18951,4440,18904,I expect to test my strengths,see how I react to a hard and pressing environment.I expect to get support with any academic problems I may have.Mostly I hope to come out of this course with a few more friends and some more jobs waiting for me!!
1,18952,4427,18945,How do you plan to achieve this understanding?
1,18953,4441,18904,expect the course to direct my interests so I can concertrate on the certain areas that become of interest throughout the course which will inevitable decide my chosen career path
1,18954,4437,18904,I want to get a lot from the course in terms of learning about various aspects of forensice psychology, like finding out more about the clinical and legal aspects which i know very little about.<br />The staff should be avaliable if we want to pick their brains about their expertise in order for us to gain a better understanding of the course.<br />I will like to here from some prison psychologists on how to get into that career in terms of working with high risk offenders like rapists.<br />I expect the students to help each other when needed and the staff to give us critical but good advice on our work.
1,18955,4439,18904,To be fully informed of the details dealing with police management, effectiveness and the issues they face within criminal investigations.<br />To acquire an understanding of the theoretical principles behind issues such as offender profiling, geopgraphical profiling etc... and to apply them in real life circumstances.<br />To gain abilities and knowledge from the course that will make us marketable employees
1,18956,4427,18946,What fields are you interested in?
1,18957,4438,18904,Ability to make links within the forensic field, preferably with future employers.
1,18958,4427,18948,Which subjects?
1,18959,4438,18904,An environment where it will be okay to ask for help, even if it does seem silly,  and not made to feel stupid!
1,18960,4429,18904,I expect to have interesting input and advice from staff and expert speakers who have experience in different fields of work relating to the course and wider areas.
1,18961,4430,18949,I always really appreciate constructive criticism in a way that encourages me to improve.
1,18962,4430,18908,I am worried that i am completely in over my head.
1,18963,4437,18908,Lots of feedback when writing eassy as its not a strong point for me
1,18964,4438,18908,Not being able to think of an interesting, forward-looking dissertation!
1,18965,4436,18908,that we will have enough preparation about what is expected from us (for example how an essay should look) before we submitt any, in order to prepare us before hand and not make us learn from our mistakes.
1,18966,4441,18908,my concerns are on the essay type assesment as I rarely gain high grade in past essays and would like to receive help from students and staff in this area
1,18967,4427,18964,How are you personally going to address this concern?
1,18968,4427,18963,What would you like this feedback to include?
1,18969,4441,18964,I agree scared about the dissertation choice
1,18970,4438,18908,That I will be refused help, and not gain enough feedback on how to really improve how I write.
1,18971,4439,18908,employability from the course?<br />Most careers seemt to be within the prison and probation services. I am not really interested in the idea of offender rehabilitation, which seems to be heavily promoted by the BPS. What other areas of employment deal more with the investigative aspect
1,18972,4427,18966,How are you personally going to address this concern?
1,18973,4440,18908,Is it hard enough for me?How easy it will be to find participants in order to support my idea regarding the big project(offenders)
1,18974,4429,18908,That my dissertation may not be as interesting as first hoped, and not as relevant to my future career path as I and my employer would like.
1,18975,4441,18968,feedback from staff and maybe other student whos area this is a strong point about layout etc
1,18976,4438,18962,You are here because you deserve to be, they wouldn&#039;t have let you on if they thought you wouldn&#039;t be able to cope. Of course there will be hard bits, but that is life.
1,18977,4427,18974,How are you going to personally address this concern?
1,18978,4441,18972,do many practice essays and pester people for help lol
1,18979,4437,18908,That i will not be able to write a good dissertation and that my supervisor will not be very helpful
1,18980,4440,18908,It is the first time I have to do a critical review.I would like to know exactly what to do in order to do it right.
1,18981,4439,18962,i think it is normal to be feeling taken aback by the work load and what is expected of us, in a way today is designed to make you aware of thew fact that you have to work hard at this, it is not undergrad where help was provided on a plate, as long as you willijng to work hard and be dilligent things will be fine
1,18982,4427,18979,How are personally going to address this concern?
1,18983,4429,18968,Structure of the essay and academic writing ability. To make the essay writing as good as published material
1,18984,4438,18967,Research areas i am interested in, and ask members of staff what groups I am able to look at, and the scope for this project.
1,18985,4437,18968,How to link paragraphs properly and how to be more concise when writing as i tend to waffle a lot
1,18986,4439,18970,as long as you have shown that you have tried to deal with the problem yourself before asking for help you will be given assistance
1,18987,4437,18982,talk to serveral supervisor and choose the one you have the best feeling about
1,18988,4440,18974,There is always the chance to hate something that you like a lot at first.In the end what matters is to be good and give an insight into something
1,18989,4430,18984,I think that once the course starts there will so many choices about where to go with our dissertations that it&#039;s just a matter of taking advantage of what rescources are there for us
1,18990,4441,18980,I agree more help on this would be good before doin it
1,18991,4429,18977,Nag staff untill i can come up with something plausible and is what i want to do.
1,18992,4441,18910,I have been at Liverpool for the past three years so if you want to go out anywhere or need help around campus I will try my best
1,18993,4437,18910,try to help others when i can especially during group work i.e. being a good member of a team
1,18994,4436,18910,Very good working in a team.<br />Hard working and dedicated.<br />Have gained experience conducting research in this area and working in the field with profiling and working with offenders and offender management.
1,18995,4429,18910,possible help with stats, but i can&#039;t promise anything
1,18996,4441,18910,I am a good team player and would really like to make alot of new friends.<br />I am not bad a stats and spss so i may be able to help with that as I did afew people last year for out 3rd year project
1,18997,4437,18910,try to find people with the same interest as me and work  together to improve the knowledge we have
1,18998,4439,18910,I am quite an outgoing person who maybe finds it easier than others to talk. Im also quite determined, hardworking and conscientious and hope by treating the masters in the professional manner that it derserves can raise everyones expectations of themselves and so we all do better than expected, i certainly feel from meeting everyone that we are all here to succeed and so this has raised my expectations of myself
1,18999,4427,18994,For example, what work did you do?
1,19000,4438,18910,Humour, background in criminology not soley psychology so I may be able to help out on the initial theory and perhaps some other things. Interested in the drug-crime link, and have done a placement at a drugs agency, so I have in inight into how non-NHS organisations run and the benefit of decentralisation on an inidividuals recovery. Knowledge of Liverpool and dance nights out.
1,19001,4441,18998,yes i agree everyone seems very friendly and hard working and hopefully we can all help each other as we will all have different experiences and stropng points!
1,19002,4436,18999,group work during degree, E.G. poster work and student led seminars.<br />Help profile an unsolved case and looked at an offender management unit
1,19003,4430,18910,The simplest thing that i can contribute at the moment is just to engage in as much as i can incliding any discussions or group work.
1,19004,4437,18996,Help with spss would be good as it certainly isn&#039;t my strong point
1,19005,4438,19002,This sounds very interesting!!
1,19006,4440,18910,The fact that I am coming from a different cultural backround will facilitate me to appreciate the importance of language and culture in an interviewing-setting.Is someone lying or just cannot express him/herself in a different language to the extent that he sounds like he/she lies.Find who is the true liar in such a setting will hopefully be my mission and eventually my contribution
1,19007,4441,19004,will try my best as I actually quite like it lol.
1,19008,4439,18996,i think pretty much everyone feels they will struggle with stats, but if you treat as just something you have to learn i think you&#039;ll pick it up quicker than you think, at undergrad level i just didnt even try!
1,19009,4429,18910,I guess beinga christian could possibly contribute to discussion. The bible speaks a lot about the justice system, how to treat people, (how people used to be treated historically for crimes) compassion, forgiveness and where these work.

1,19184,4489,19123,1 have one person talking to them. They should only ask open questions. Do not approach them to near say about 15 yards. you do not want your officer grabbing them and going over with them. Advise the officer to ask them to come down the stairs with him and to talk there.<br />You need an  intelligence cell or at least one person in charge of intelligence so that you can get some background on them. It would help if we knew who they were and what there were actually upto.<br />You need to cordon the area off and treat this as a critical incident. Inform the duty officer. Get paramedics to the scene.

1,19193,4489,19132,We need to take our time. We need to build a rapport and try and get them talking. I agree we cannot rush them. I suggest we only use two negotiators and only one will speak with them. We should stand as far away as possible so as to reduce the pressure on them. we still do not know why they are here or what there intention is. They may just be attention seeking, or this may actually be a suicide pact. We will attempt to build a rapport and then seek to use influence to get the to defer any action they may be considering.

1,19202,4489,19142,At this point I would advise not to give them water. The fact that they have asked for it is a good sign in that people who are planning death are inlikely to ask for food or water to sustain them. On the other hand this may prolong the negotiation and allow us to get a better rapport with them. I advise against giving the water to them where they are but have it here on the roof where they can see it and invite them away from the edge when we will give it to them. Better still put the water on the ground floor where they can see i

1,19211,4489,19150,We mneed to regroup. We need the negotiators to continue talking and trying to build rapport. I still think this is the only way we can save their lives. We could consider having a negotiator go up on a r=firemans ladder and talk to them from the other side of the wall, almost in the air. It will take away that space from them psychologically.<br />We should ask them to come away now and come to safety where we can look after them. we need to tell them that they will not be arrested.

1,19221,4489,19159,I would advise against using a third party intermediary at this stage because there is a significant risk to them. The rooftop is unsafe. The strees is difficult to calculate and TPIs are difficult to control when emotions are high. However I would not dismiss this completely and would ask that she remain here in case we change outr minds. On the other hand there may be a TPI who is less emotionally tied up in this and the sister may be able to help us

1,19250,4493,19123,Isolate, contain, evacuate, negotiate.  Focus on one person talking to them, don&#039;t give them anything or let them talk to anyone else, and ask them to come down.  Keep me up to date, I am on my way.
1,19251,4492,19123,If there is anyone already talking to them then thats fine. If they want to volunteer information in relation to why they are there then this would be useful. Try to gain as much intelligence for me as you possibly can into their background before my arrival but not necesarrily from them unless they volunteer it.
1,19252,4494,19123,Choose the officer youthink best suited from those available and get them to go and ask them why they are there and if they will come down to safety.<br />emphasize they are not in any trouble and that we are worried about their safety.<br />If they refuse, ask what is stopping them coming down.<br />Check for safety - are they drunk or drugged and can they slip.<br />Offer what ever you are confortable as a concession - warm drink etc.<br />Call me at any time for advice or if things change at all

1,19278,4492,19132,To engage the subjects from a distance to illicit the reason that they they there. To prevent the subjects from causing harm to themselves by attempting to bring them to a safer place to engage in conversation. To ensure the safety of the negotiating team by ensuring they do not deploy alone and have correct ppe.
1,19279,4494,19132,What is the strategy fro the incident?<br />Assuming saving life and return to public normality -<br />To ask them what they are doing there.<br />Find out the level of risk they pose to themelves or others.<br />Seek to establish if they are willing to come to safety - use active listening and emotional labelling to establish rapport, gain trust and seek to influence them to choose a safe resolution.<br />Define intel. requirements -<br />Knowledge of the people, history, use of drugs or alcohol and any mental illness.<br />Find family/friends fro further info.
1,19280,4493,19132,Police officer who has engaged them in conversation will introduce negotiator(s) (preferably 2) who will begin to engage with the two on the roof.  Strategy is to engage them with a view to<br />1)  Encourage them to come down safely<br />2) Identify why here and why now - what is this about?<br />3) Identify any intelligence opportunities<br />4) Provide information to the incident commander for consideration of other tactical options

1,19306,4494,19141,Ask them if they will come to safety for the water.<br />If not, ask them if they need any medicines or food as we are worried they might slip and fall.<br />I would agree to give them the water.<br />I would describe how we give it to them carefully - we should agree that we will move forward, place it near to them and withdraw. If the decision is not to try to grab them, this should be made clear and promised to them.<br />I would ask if food is approved and offer it to them to enduce reciprocity
1,19307,4492,19141,THe chance to have water could mean that they become more comfotable and may lengthen the time they are prepared to stay in position. Conversely it shows that we are giving them something to help them in their situation. It is early in the incident to provide them with a demand and may be an option to deny it at this stage but consider it for later on.
1,19308,4493,19141,Giving them some water may encourage a response and encourage them to engage in converstaion.  It is part of Maslow&#039;s Hierarchy of Needs, and likely to bring them into the Social Needs&#039; tier, and therefore more likely to engage with negotiators.  Agreeing to give them some water may also buy more time to develop the behavioural stairway of active listening, empathy, rapport, influence and change of behaviour.  Providing water will build on rapport.  At this stage they are not offering much information, therefore providing water seems reasonable.

1,19334,4493,19150,1.  In view of the negotiator not helping the situation - you are the incident commander - do you have any alternative suggestions.<br />2.  if not, then I suggest negotiator(s) continue to engage with the second person in crisis and attempt to reinforce what a dangerous situation this is, encourage them to come down safely, continue to gather information and try to buy some more time allowing the incident commander to consider alternative tactical interventions (although they would be high risk in the circumstances).
1,19335,4493,19151,10
1,19336,4494,19150,Put strong emphasis on negotiation - has not hindered situation; whether it has helped or not.<br />Change negotiation strategy to engaging with remaining person about the trauma they may be feeling at the shock of the other person falling or jumping.<br />Establish delivery of water/food.<br />Ask them to come and tell us what happened - we do not know. Use them to tell the other person&#039;s story - do they know if they jumped and why?<br />I the other person fell - use protective advice - we do not want them to fall.
1,19337,4492,19150,It appears that one life has been lost which could mean that the likelihood of the other subject now taking their own life is heightened. The negotiators should further attempt to engage with the subject. I would suggest that it is not detrimental to approach the person who fell/jumped to offer medical assistance if there is no further info to suggest that this would be unsafe.

1,19361,4492,19159,the intermediary is the dead persons sister and is obviously very emotionally charged as her sister has died. There is a possibility that she may blame the subject for her sisters deatch which could lead to her being detrimental to the situation. Without any further information as to their casue then I would not use her at this stage.
1,19362,4493,19159,The use of an intermediary is a high risk tactic.  At this point we do not know what this is about or why this girl is in this position.  Use of her sister may de-escalate the risk, however it may escalate the risk.  My advice at this stage is to debrief sister about all she knows about her sister and why she may be here today and look to utilise any intelligence.  I can task negotiators with letting girl know her sister is here and exploring their relationship in order that a more informed decision can be made on introducing sister into the negotiations.
1,19363,4493,19160,10
1,19364,4494,19159,Establish connection to remaining person.<br />TPI is high risk, but high reward - if there is a strong influence the TPI can exert. If no strong influence there is little point putting the TPI at risk of harm through being at height or psychological exposure beyond what they have already had.<br />If they know the other person and can influence them strongly, check for potential conflicts - adverse relationship.<br />Caution - the other person could be blamed for the death of the TPI&#039;s sister.<br />I will need to interview TPI at length first. 5 mins minimum

1,19601,4535,19459,Their performance may change to adapt to my mood
1,19602,4533,19459,could have impact on levels of stress and the associated side effects such as decreased performance, decreased levels of interest in their work

1,19604,4529,19459,they suffer from stress
1,19605,4540,19458,These could be many and varied ranging from the effects of high demand and few resorces to traumatic incidents such as child death or a threat to their own life
1,19606,4528,19460,Better managerial support, time for staff, a better understanding of the causes and symptoms of stress, and effective management techniques.

1,19631,4538,19459,negative performance
1,19632,4523,19459,Pressure on staff does improve performance, as they become more focussed on outputs or outcomes, but too much pressure and reliance on autocrasy can get them to the point where they become too stressed to work well
1,19633,4525,19461,Ensure communicated approriately.
1,19634,4533,19461,ensure close contact and monitoring from first line supervisor. Build on close team working of colleauges by team building events and meetings, maybe outside of work
1,19635,4532,19459,they might go off sick as a coping method so they dont have to deal with it
1,19636,4524,19460,allow for more feedback to aid preparation for future situations
1,19637,4528,19461,Better staffing of welfare support.  Training for all staff re stress and its symptoms, clear understanding of support structures and how to access them (de-mystify the process make stress an acceptable thing to talk about, with staff not being frightened to raise their hands when they are getting into trouble.  I nbelieve there is a fear that people stating they have stress will see an impact on their future career.

1,19689,4559,19685,what happens if you placement falls through?
1,19690,4569,19687,nobody forensic to support interests in that area
1,19691,4554,19686,I feel like there is not much practical knowledge, and am wondering what I will actually have to bring apart from a graduation certificate from this course to an interview?
1,19692,4564,19685,when will we find out for definate when we get our placements?
1,19693,4559,19687,how long do i have before i have to settle on an idea from teh broad range im working off
1,19694,4567,19685,think people may have stressed about placements as this restricted continuing with dissertation plans...as many planned on using the placement to collect data.
1,19695,4566,19686,Can we have a list of websites and useful sites which are directly related to jobs within a forensic setting?
1,19696,4562,19686,what places do you think will be easier than say prisons to get some experience in?
1,19697,4570,19689,We will endeavour to find another. Not always possibel but we will try... what makes you think it might
1,19698,4567,19686,bluelinejobs is a good place to start for investigative roles
1,19699,4568,19687,how big a literature review to do given the tiny word limit?
1,19700,4560,19686,I think if a day was specifically devoted to discuss careers following completion of this course and ways/contacts of how to get into these areas would be very useful.
1,19701,4557,19685,I was left confused as to wether placements were compulsory or not? There seemed to be a clack of clarity with regard to &#039;what if we didnt do a placement&#039; or &#039;were they absolutely essential&#039; ?
1,19702,4567,19686,PhD&#039;s at Liverpool??? are they possible?
1,19703,4569,19685,we were told that placements should be done to support our dissertation, but also told not to rely on placement to collect data- confusing info.
1,19704,4553,19685,Identifying a suitable placement was problematic due to lack of a definitive list of opportunities.  Nor was there sufficient description of what was involved in each placement opportunity which was mentioned.  People seemed to feel pressured to undertake a placement despite these being described as optional
1,19705,4559,19697,well that i have nothing concrete at the moment and im just touching base with people
1,19706,4568,19700,can we get this well prior to the completion of the course?
1,19707,4557,19698,but be sure to have a c.v. ready if you want to complete the registration process (they will request this)
1,19708,4567,19686,feel like PhDs have been slightly neglected which is suprising when they are many students who have continued their career here
1,19709,4560,19685,I think the placement should be made a mandatory aspect of the course as it allows you not gain experience and incite into the practical application of the things we have discussed, more importantly it may open up may open up job opportunities
1,19710,4562,19686,is there going to be a doctorate course at liverpool soon?? and if there is would we be able to do this given we have done the masters already??
1,19711,4558,19703,...the placement is not part of this year&#039;s course but still (nearly )everyone has one. There are no consequenses for people do not have a placement.It is just a matter of personal benefit...
1,19712,4559,19708,i agree discuss??
1,19713,4557,19699,there are many books on &#039;how to write dissertations&#039; a comprehensive overview is given in the programme handbook. Plus a million  web addys on the subject
1,19714,4554,19686,What careers are available? There seems to be so many possible routes but what routes are opened up with course haven&#039;t been made clear. Only pHDs have really been discussed. Recently I have been panicking that I will come out of this course and actually have been worse off than had I applied for jobs a year ago. The picture that has been painted is bleak.
1,19715,4567,19709,i agree. believe it gives insight, and most people want to do this-as shown this year.
1,19716,4570,19690,do you mean no one that is clinical? Not sure what you mean
1,19717,4564,19709,i agree with this as the practical experience is just as if not more important than the academic work we do in uni
1,19718,4554,19706,sounds good to me, would be EXTREMELY useful.
1,19719,4569,19715,yes. This was one of the reasons i wanted to do the course in order to gain practical working insight
1,19720,4557,19695,why not pro-actively go and look for them? think of your key words and do some forensic investigation!
1,19721,4567,19712,lack of guidance who to see and how to tackle when funding for case award has passed
1,19722,4565,19687,I wanted to try and talk to other people and ask questions to people outside the course to try and facilitate my dissertation ideas. I am worried about doing this as we were warned against making contact with other people at the beginning of the course. How far can I go with making contact that doesn&#039;t involve asking permission for any potential question or conversation?
1,19723,4562,19709,i agree because it gives you alot more idea of the type of job you may actually end up doing
1,19724,4564,19718,yep i agree I feel a little lost with everything as all we seem to hear is that there aren&#039;t many jobs around at the minute
1,19725,4569,19716,it seems everyone is very investigative and without Kevin Browne, no-one seems interested in the actual offender side of things. i.e. treatment, and some clinical aspects that you would see on a forensi psychology courser
1,19726,4566,19709,Deffinately, I think the placement aspect has become a great bridge between academia and practitioner. It something i feel will be valuable within an interview setting for future jobs. I always worry that just having a qualification or a degree seems rather lacking when it comes to interviews.
1,19727,4557,19709,it would make more sense to have the placment worth credits as previous years have done. Especially if they are connected to guest speakers intrests or that of the Department
1,19728,4560,19708,the problem was that the deadline for the funding dates was changed and ther department wasnt notified till the last minute, therefore it appeared to pass everyone by
1,19729,4554,19704,And there was a definite investigative slant. Not everyone is here for the investigative side of the course!!
1,19730,4570,19714,Where has the perception of the bleak picture emerged from - can you tell us why you feel this way?
1,19731,4563,19724,I feel the same way. A little more guidance and clarity would be beneficial for us career wise. Which routes into different jobs would be best for us to take etc
1,19732,4565,19728,But surely there muct be alternative strategies for doing a PhD without this sort of funding because not everyone gets this. I am not entirely sure what they are though.
1,19733,4554,19719,yeh this is one of the main reasons I did the course. I thought allocation of placements would be more systematic and there would be greater opportunity.
1,19734,4564,19720,this is difficult to do if you are not really sure where to start!
1,19735,4558,19702,What is exactly the process of doing a part-time self-funded PhD?Is is just a matter of finding a supervisor and a &quot;good&quot; idea
1,19736,4553,19687,It would be useful to have some definitive guidance regarding how much contact time to expect from your supervisor and level of involvement etc.  Also advice about the departmental &#039;rules&#039; about seeking input from other lecturers etc.  More information all round basically
1,19737,4562,19704,i agree i think these should be more forensic placements avaliable in future
1,19738,4554,19698,what about forensic roles?
1,19739,4568,19699,feel like a lot is riding on decisions made now/soon about dissertation topic/method given it counts towards RM module and dissertation. how much leeway will there be to change/adapt it as we go, e.g. in response to feedback on the RM module?
1,19740,4566,19720,I have done, But my results always come out with &quot;none listed&quot;. I don&#039;t believe forensic jobs would come through search engines like &quot;Fish4jobs&quot; etc
1,19741,4567,19728,something should have been put in palace to inform us of other options as people who were interested in staying at Liverpool are now looking elsewhere as there seems to be lack of options
1,19742,4559,19725,but this courses focus was mainly on the investigative side of psychology not the clinical side of forensic psychology as most forensic psychology course are all clinically based.... where as this is an INVESTIGATIVE course
1,19743,4569,19688,distinct lack of guidance on chartership. Practically told it woudl be a waste of time for us to do it. The only things i know about it are from speaking to Kevin Browne after class one day
1,19744,4557,19685,Is it actually the case that there was a &#039;missed oppertunity&#039; of sorts to do a similar 10kV beofre the Christmas break? this would have highlighted the more problematic areas of concern much sooner on the course continum. Maybe future courses will benefit from this?!
1,19745,4564,19733,yes definately!
1,19746,4567,19698,best place is to keep an eye on BPS and NHS
1,19747,4567,19696,probation?
1,19748,4560,19686,There is much emphasis on doing a PhD, however i feel there is a lack of thought given to what you will do after completing the PhD, what are the routes available after that, post doc, teaching?you must be certain you want to carry on in academia as a PhD in a practical setting may actually go against you (i.e. you have spent 3 years studying when you could have been gaining experience).
2,19749,4571,0,General Concerns?
1,19750,4570,19722,you just need to come and discuss it with a member of staff and we will gladly help faciliate those discussions
1,19751,4567,19698,think redsnapper is another one
1,19752,4569,19742,i was under the improseeion this was an investigative AND  forensic psychology course! it is false advertising if this course is designed mainly for investigative and i think if Kevin Browne were still the course director, it would have more of a forensic element
1,19753,4562,19742,its also a forensic based course too...or that was the impression i got at my interview...to at least give a more equally balanced side of things
1,19754,4564,19714,i agreee with this, I think I may have been better getting a job straight from undergrad as I am still stuck as to the direction I am going in now as there seems little opportunities for us
1,19755,4557,19740,the BPS web site is a good starting point, as is the magazine called the &#039;psychologist&#039; published by the BPS. This will give you a good ideaz as to whats out there and what kinds of experience yoiu need. Also HMP Prision service, Probation Service have good sites too
1,19756,4553,19686,It would be good to hear what students from, say, previous years students have gone on to do careerwise.  Also to find out what, if any, successes they have had in networking
1,19757,4570,19691,The transferable skills you learn on this course will stead you well for any carrear path you choose
1,19758,4567,19704,but that is the name of the course, along with forensic, so it will be more investigative than most forensic courses
1,19759,4560,19688,i think it was a real shame to let kevin leave the department, i am unsure of the reasons as to his departure but i feel, and i think most others do, he was an invaluable incite into the role that a forensic practitioner has
1,19760,4554,19730,A lot of the guest speakers have given a really great lecture, and when asked about how did they get into the field, or how someone in our position could, most routes seem to not fit with what we are doing, they are either clinical, or voluntary etc. Doesn&#039;t seem like there&#039;s a job apart from working as a forensic psychologists assistant working towards chartership in prison?!
1,19761,4565,19756,We do know some of these because some of them have come back to talk to us.
1,19762,4566,19698,HMP.gov.uk i think is one that puts up jobs in a forensic setting but again, there&#039;s never anything listed.
1,19763,4554,19749,Application of knowledge? Practical experince is lacking!
1,19764,4553,19688,is Liverpool lobbying the BPS/Prison Service to get a chartership trg system similar to the clinical model - if not, why not?!
1,19765,4557,19735,I think it is more than just having a good idea. An ability to operationalise a theoretical construct into a more concrete hypotesis is required. Plus the ability to nextwork in the areas you are interested in. What are those areas?
1,19766,4558,19688,Will the BPS ever recognise Investigative Psyc. as an established division of psychology with a clear-cut route of accreditation rather than a &quot; long-term project&quot; within the general field of Forensic Psyc.?
1,19767,4567,19749,lack of input from some students. i expected this course to communicate their experience and SHARE with the group. only a few people seem to share, which i am shocked about
1,19768,4560,19756,nikki grieves!
1,19769,4554,19688,we havent been told about the realities of gong down this route, examples have been given from guest speakers of it lasting 6-7 years!
1,19770,4559,19749,what is the issue involving the status of david canter within the uni and the reasons behind him choosing to set up a course in huddersfeild?? there is too much rumour and id like some facts.... please ;)
1,19771,4553,19749,There seem to be some avoidable issues created for students in time management due to sequencing of dissertation ethics superimposed on a course which has already been front loaded this year.
1,19772,4565,19749,There seems to be a general lack of interset and support for those students who are more interested in the forensic side of the course.
1,19773,4567,19686,does liverpool provide PhD with continuation of Chartership?
1,19774,4566,19769,Yes, we&#039;ve been put off by people who have spoke about the time and money that it takes to become chartered. I would love to get this far one day, but i can&#039;t say i have much money left!!
1,19775,4560,19691,The course is fantastic for developing theoretical knowledge, however in terms of practical knowledge i feel the course porvides very little....i think it is important that at masters level this course must attempt to synthesize a relationship between academia and the real world
1,19776,4554,19686,I want to get out there and work with people and make a difference. I can&#039;t understand why it&#039;s so hard when I will have this degree and have the enthusiasm to find a job!? I am so disheartened.
1,19777,4567,19749,i quite like the fact that the course is front loaded as i am very much looking forward to focusing my time on my dissertation
1,19778,4557,19749,As a cohort did we miss the oppertunity to cohesively gel in such a pro-active way that &#039;sharing of imformation&#039; was openly encouraged. Through cohesion could have grown &#039;study groups&#039; for particular areas of intrest. There is still scope to work on this!
1,19779,4559,19767,i agree there seems to be the core who choose to participant and that has left the few who do talk feeling the need to be interactive in areas that they might not really fully be interested in just to engage the speaker and give a good impression
1,19780,4562,19772,definately i feel there is no interest in those especially who want to become chartered in forensic psychology
1,19781,4553,19767,people have different sorts of personalities and there is not a correct level of contribution.  Put differently if some people choose to say little there is more time for those who have a need to say more
1,19782,4554,19775,yeh. I have heard that other forensic psych masters courses have been taught how to conduct real risk assessments! We haven&#039;t had anything like this!
1,19783,4558,19728,I cannot see how the deadline for the funding of a PhD is related to actually doing one.If you really want to do it you just pay for it!
1,19784,4559,19778,i agree we should still explore this we do still have plenty of time
1,19785,4560,19698,YOU NEED EXPERIENCE...your attendance on this course is not sufficient to gain employment, the only way you will get experience that ironically does not reply prior experience like all other jobs is through volunteering
1,19786,4567,19749,i think the lack of forensic experience that was supposed to be mandatory for this course is lacking amongst students which has impacted upon their ability to get involved in discussion-Think the course should stipulate this next year!!
1,19787,4564,19772,i feel a lack of support for those who are unsure as to what they want to do after also
1,19788,4559,19781,but thats not the case how can you hope to survive in a world where you choose not to interact in..... why be here at all?
1,19789,4567,19781,understandable but would be nice to have any contribution
1,19790,4565,19775,I agree with this comment. The theoretical ideas have been well established and the course content has been very varied and interesting however the practical side i feel is somewhat lacking (despite the placement as there seem to be a few problems with these).
1,19791,4557,19691,practical knowledge can come through your volutary intrests that you have done at both pre-and post graduate level. These are the things that will give you an edge over your peers
1,19792,4562,19767,not everyone has something to contribute as at times their questions may have already been answered or asked by some1 else....people should not feel pressured to ask questions if they are not comfortable asking questions
1,19793,4568,19784,how shall we go about this? i think it would be useful for at least those doing investigative focused dissertations and those more forensic/clinical maybe to share their ideas within these areas?
1,19794,4560,19783,are you joking?may be not, may be your rich..
1,19795,4553,19687,This is perhaps an ideal area for facilitating interaction between IFP and CI courses - ie opportunity to understand each other&#039;s perspectives on the various issues and topics.  Lack of interaction between us and the police seems to have been a major opportunity missed this year
1,19796,4554,19749,There isn&#039;t any continuity in the course, nothing strings everything together.
1,19797,4553,19749,The course handbook advertised two or three conferences at Brunswick Dock - we have hear nothing about these so far
1,19798,4557,19749,This 10kV should have included a facet of &#039;what worked&#039; or &#039;near misses&#039; to see what the cohort actualy liked about the course!
1,19799,4560,19776,i understnad your frustration i am the same too, so much so that i have considered a change in career path which is quite disheartening as i had full confidence that this course was going to be the right direction for me.
1,19800,4557,19793,the oppertunity will be there in the de-brief of this session, why not raise it there ?
1,19801,4554,19772,definately!!! The course title is investigative and forensic psych, not just invest!!!!!
1,19802,4559,19772,i love everyone
1,19803,4557,19772,i totally disagree, who have you approached with regard to this issue? how you proactively souch to clarify?
1,19804,4553,19749,didn&#039;t like personal feedback made public in group feedback
1,19805,4554,19752,i agree. the course is both. It wouldnt get accredited if it was just investigative. It seems like theres only forensic added just to get the accreditation, it needs more of a focus for definate.
1,19806,4557,19763,are good idea would be for students to give a presentation at the start of the course as to what they have done over the summer (I.e. volunteer work, experiences of working with forensic cohorts etc..). This would stimulate ideas and get members of the group to not only gel but introduce new ideas to each other. This will also help with looking for placments later in the course, or careers even!
1,19807,4559,19804,when?
1,19808,4560,19786,definately agree with this statement, experience is essential not only for the course but for jobs after the course has finished
1,19809,4554,19722,bit worried that no one is going to look at drafts, what is the point of a supervisor in which case?
1,19810,4558,19773,No!
1,19811,4567,19792,its not about putting pressure on people to ask q&#039;s but provide insight/thoughts from own experience
1,19812,4557,19795,i totally concur with this comment, it was definately an oppertunityy missed
1,19813,4565,19804,I disagree, if there are people who are interested in the same things then i would imagine you are already talking to them. Ther eis no need to seperate already divided areas of interest...why not share with all and focys discussions with people oding the same topice. No need to be more cliquy
1,19814,4553,19749,would like to hear directly from police about what contributions from psychologists they would see as benefitting policing in the ideal world (taking no account of budgetary constraints<br />ie what do they really think of our contribution/potential contribution
1,19815,4567,19772,think if you want to find out more you can...you got to explore and research yourself
1,19816,4567,19796,not sure what you are looking for in a course??? most courses act in this way...you decide where you want to go from here
1,19817,4564,19809,ye I am little worried about this too!
1,19818,4553,19686,it would have been good to have had a guest speaker who was a psychiatrist for same reasons as it has been outstanding to have input from police visiting speakers
1,19819,4554,19749,don&#039;t ever feel valued in this course
1,19820,4567,19814,talk to critical incident students-they will help you with this
1,19821,4565,19807,I think it&#039;s obvbious who this is but there was a particulat incident involving placements that came as a shock (however much it was my fault), the news might have been better recieved in an email and not in from of the whole group.
1,19822,4562,19811,not every1 has experience in a forensic setting
1,19823,4560,19760,very much so..

1,19889,4633,19873,beginning of studies...more relaxing
1,19890,4624,19878,because i spent this year travelling and drunk
1,19891,4623,19879,because 6th form was the best time of my life
1,19892,4628,19876,to see how much ive learned over the past few years...
1,19893,4634,19871,id make few different decisions; i had a great time at school
1,19894,4630,19880,because i would do more things with my life from that time
1,19895,4625,19872,because toddlers don&#039;t have any worries
1,19896,4632,19875,no one cares if you run around shouting random unintelligible sentences
1,19897,4624,19874,because lots of things are free below this age
1,19898,4627,19875,because i moved in this year and would like to see how it was
1,19899,4628,19865,yes...many...!
1,19900,4625,19865,Don&#039;t like the idea of group seminars
1,19901,4626,19866,I expect to gain a thorough background in forensic and investigative psychology and prepare to write a thesis
1,19902,4629,19865,keeping up with the reading
1,19903,4624,19865,most of it. at the moment the first book review is woorying me slightly, never done one before
1,19904,4632,19865,mostly to do with workload
1,19905,4630,19865,that it will be difficult to do well in
1,19906,4637,19900,Why?
1,19907,4628,19867,what if when i am given a placement, and i dont want it? can i just say that its not for me? or would lol get really ANGRY?
1,19908,4627,19865,workload...keeping myself organised!!
1,19909,4625,19866,to prepare me for a career
1,19910,4628,19900,me neither!
1,19911,4634,19866,to cover a broad range of topics, experts sharing their experiences,
1,19912,4635,19899,such as...?
1,19913,4631,19865,Feel a bit like I&#039;m the only one with no relevent work experience
1,19914,4633,19865,a littlle bit concerned about the expectations
1,19915,4624,19866,to get through it alive with whole range of skills that i can take with me on to future plans
1,19916,4632,19866,A detailed and up-to-date background in forensic psychology
1,19917,4623,19903,thats my concern also, reading and analysing a whole book could take months!
1,19918,4629,19868,how are we suposed to know what to do our dissertations on in week 1?!
1,19919,4627,19866,to provide me with a greater knowledge in the field and open career paths
1,19920,4625,19906,I can see them turning into a nightmare!
1,19921,4628,19906,because what should we do it on? what is the point of it? will we be marked?
1,19922,4624,19867,not getting one, it falling through etc
1,19923,4631,19867,Are we expected to cover all costs of transport etc. for our placements?
1,19924,4626,19869,besides academia, what are other career opportunities available with this degree/PhD?
1,19925,4634,19866,to figure out which area of IFP interests me  most
1,19926,4625,19921,I hadn&#039;t even thought about if we&#039;d be marked, now that&#039;s worrying me!!!!
1,19927,4633,19866,a good starting point for a career with the police, getting a food in the door for later jobs, getting a phd funded
1,19928,4624,19868,finding a suitablle question<br />then a millions othjer things
1,19929,4627,19868,deciding on a topic and then working out how to actually do the research!
1,19930,4623,19913,ditto
1,19931,4632,19867,All the admin stuff (like the diary)
1,19932,4624,19869,how do i get into offender profilng , what i need to start looking at now to head that way
1,19933,4631,19900,I think they&#039;ll be quite good, everyone seem friendly on our course so everyone&#039;s in the same boat!
1,19934,4628,19902,i would become overwhelmed with the reading too...but i only read the things that i HAVE to... for example, the CB course- i only read the books on the essay topic im doing, and then the book for the critical review
1,19935,4626,19913,I&#039;m in the same boat, so you&#039;re not the only one
1,19936,4632,19868,Getting participants if I do an experimental study
1,19937,4629,19924,id love to know...!
1,19938,4634,19907,i don&#039;t think you will be given one if you don&#039;t want it
1,19939,4636,19866,to get the knowledges of forensic psychology
1,19940,4633,19867,how do I prepare for the placement to get the best out of it, can I extend my work there somehow to get a better view of the work there and get more involved
1,19941,4631,19903,I feel like we need a bit more advice on the types of books we should be reviewing, is it textbooks?! How long should they be?!
1,19942,4625,19868,Getting the type of sensitive data I want
1,19943,4634,19868,going into an area which would bring potential employment
1,19944,4623,19868,most subjects seem like it would be incredibly hard to carry out experiments or get hold of data due to the nature of the subject
1,19945,4629,19924,i think it would be usefull to have a careers talk because iv not got a scooby do
1,19946,4624,19900,i dont think it too much to worry about ti think the idea is to get us to work together whcih will bring us closer as we r all panicking and all thinking what the hell do we do. end of it, know group really well for help on future projects<br />]
1,19947,4628,19903,ye- like, how do WE know if a legitimate  acedemic has written his book badly??
1,19948,4632,19869,If you don&#039;t get onto a PhD, where exactly do you look for a career?
1,19949,4625,19933,yeah, but every seminar-type-thing I&#039;ve done in the past has been stressful and not worth it at the end
1,19950,4633,19868,will there be any help with forming the research question? will it be supervised regularly, so it is not only once read, when the supervisor is grading it
1,19951,4634,19870,enthusiasm and willingness to learn
1,19952,4628,19941,i agree entirely!!!! what books should we read?!?!?!
1,19953,4626,19870,my relevant backgound knowledge from previous courses/experiences
1,19954,4623,19932,there is only 5 in the country so maybe look abroad!
1,19955,4631,19918,Same! I&#039;m worried about just launching into one I don&#039;t really know that much about and then regretting it when we cover other topics which I may find more interesting
1,19956,4627,19867,worried that i will not fill the expectations set by those that have done the placement before me
1,19957,4636,19865,my poor language skill
1,19958,4632,19870,Enthusiasm for learning and some previous knowledge
1,19959,4628,19913,i ahve no acedemic or working experience for this course, so youre certainly not on your own
1,19960,4633,19869,combining clinical and police work, working on counterterrorism, working with sexual offenders, working on investigation techniques of serial offending
1,19961,4624,19947,well i think the idea is to compare the theme or topic from that booik with other reserach in that area and see what has been written differently, this way u can compare strengths and weaknesses
1,19962,4629,19907,if the placement isnt in liverpool do we organise our own accomodation?
1,19963,4627,19870,enthusiasm for the subject
1,19964,4634,19913,it&#039;ll get better
1,19965,4632,19941,my thoughts exactly
1,19966,4633,19870,interest and enthusiasm, ideas of what I want to learn, previous knowledge in the field of sexual and violent offending and development of antisocial and criminal behaviour during the lifecourse
1,19967,4628,19938,but i have put my name down for several....but if it seems too demanding or if its too far away and im not prepared to committ to it entirely dur to course demands?
1,19968,4629,19918,me too, also does doing ur dissertation on a specific subject limit what u can do afterwards?
1,19969,4627,19914,me too
1,19970,4629,19918,i want to do a bit of everything before i have to commit to one thing
1,19971,4628,19968,thats a great question...!
1,19972,4637,19946,Also if you all work together to split the work up evenly and everyone does what they&#039;re supposed to do, then the work load shouldn&#039;t be that high!
1,19973,4628,19918,yes! HOW??
1,19974,4632,19934,that seems a more sensible approach than what I was going to do (spend all day everyday reading everything)
1,19975,4634,19870,knowledge from previou work experience in forensic settings
1,19976,4629,19968,why thankyou
1,19977,4635,19914,what do you mean exactly?
1,19978,4628,19929,thats a concern of mine too- but thats what our supervisors are for
1,19979,4624,19921,no i dont think we are as lawrence said that ppl doing the tier three will miss it, but thats not much of a problem,but i dont know for sure
1,19980,4625,19957,everyone here who doesn&#039;t have english as their first language is doing amazingly with everything I think!!! Don&#039;t worry about it, you&#039;re all doing tonnes better than I would be able to!
1,19981,4633,19902,I am also already a little bit overwhelmed with the reading, but I think these study weeks will help to keep up
1,19982,4633,19902,might be nice if the reading suggestions are in an order from the most to the less important one
1,19983,4631,19865,Costs of the course - trying to juggle part-time work (in order to actually pay for it) and then actual uni work too!
1,19984,4636,19867,It&#039;s good chance to learn from law enforcement and collect data.
1,19985,4628,19870,enthusiam- but everyone has that, otherwise they wouldnt be here!! i have NOTHING else to bring to the table though
1,19986,4629,19960,if so who are u employed by?
1,19987,4631,19968,I&#039;d never actually thought about that -  now i&#039;m worried!
1,19988,4625,19983,That&#039;s really hard for me too, I was just thinking about that! Money is really really tight and I feel caught in a catch 22 between working to pay for the course and doing enough to do myself justice with it
1,19989,4632,19968,I don&#039;t think so. It will make it easier to follow the same lines later on because you&#039;ve got some previous knowledge, but nobody&#039;s going to say you can&#039;t do a PhD in one thing because you did your dissertation in something else.
1,19990,4627,19977,the level of work that is expected from us...standard of essay writing etc.
1,19991,4633,19903,That is also my concern, I feel not able to say in this field of research if the book I just read is of great importance in the field, if I have to do so I would have to choose a book frrom an area I know quite well which is not very interesting
1,19992,4634,19865,being able to fund my studies so that i dont have to worry about money and focus on uni work
1,19993,4625,19980,i&#039;m sure they take language skill into account as well when marking
1,19994,4628,19912,group seminars, the dissertation, not excelling in any particular module, not finding a job afterwards....!
1,19995,4634,19988,that&#039;s absolutely true. i feel the same
1,19996,4627,19867,good oppprtunity to get out there and get first hand experience
1,19997,4637,19913,If we didn&#039;t have what we need to have to be on this course, we wouldn&#039;t be here. Therefore, we are all completely qualified!
1,19998,4631,19870,Not alot! I&#039;m very interested but have no relevent work experience and am fresh from my undergrad course so pretty much feel my only skills are purely general academic psychology
1,19999,4628,19972,so if we&#039;re not marked, can we just tdo a relatively easy one and all take it easy?
1,20000,4625,19995,i think they should pay us per essay so we can earn some money back ;)
1,20001,4633,19977,like that we have to do a book review and everyone was like that&#039;s a pretty common thing to do and I thought &quot;I&#039;ve never done that before, how should I do it without good advice&quot;, the same with the essays, I have never written one so far, different from everyone else it seems, so I doubted it will be possible to have your supervisor read parts of it before you hand it in too be graded
1,20002,4628,19961,well thats just great... we have to read more than one book in that area??!?!
1,20003,4632,19979,I think laurence meant they would miss the final day of the Tier 3 as it&#039;s just feedback, but they still had to do the seminars.
1,20004,4637,19990,The first essay will probably be a bit of a learning curve for finding out about the standard of work needed to get good marks.
1,20005,4636,19870,just passion
1,20006,4627,19869,i am hoping that at somepoint throughout the course, it will click and I will have a more specific idea of what I want to do, rather than the really broad and general idea I have got now!
1,20007,4624,19999,i think the idea is u get out of it what u pout in, for example ul learn skills doing this u dont have or will be good practive for future and presentations and things, which i know i ccertainly would like practive on now that its a group effort
1,20008,4634,19962,this interests me too. are we supposed to cover all related expences? for example, if i have a placement in london for 3 weeks, am I supposed to stay in a hotel or what?
1,20009,4637,20000,That would be brilliant!
1,20010,4631,19983,I know, I&#039;ve got to solely rely on my earnings to pay for this course and can&#039;t really afford to cut back hours at work. I was told not to work over 20 hours but I&#039;ve been been put on the rota for 30 hours a week for next too weeks! But I need the money but am already knackered from all the work - STRESS!!
1,20011,4637,20000,That would be brilliant!
1,20012,4633,19957,with me it is more those shortcuts or regulations which seem to be common knowledge and which I sometimes don&#039;t understand
1,20013,4625,20009,I reckon we get a petition together ;)
1,20014,4624,20002,yeah but i think the idea is on a theme or topic within the bookk so its not everything, if u look at it this way its not so much. i mean a particvular chapter is usualy focussed on one thing
1,20015,4628,20013,LETS DO IT!
1,20016,4628,20010,you can only do what you can do. why dont you have a word with your boss? the worst s/he can say is no. if not, talk to laurence or another coordinator. thats what theyre there for.
1,20017,4627,19869,the level of competition for getting a job after the course
1,20018,4631,19970,Same - don&#039;t want all my eggs in one basket so to speak!
1,20019,4632,20001,I have written a few essays, but I&#039;ve never done a book review before, so I&#039;m in the same boat as you there.
1,20020,4623,20010,didnt he say you can get kicked off for that if they find out??
1,20021,4633,19968,I am also wondering if working on a topic in depth will enhance your chances everywhere or will it make you stick with that topic later on in your career
1,20022,4625,19900,I don&#039;t think they&#039;re going to be worthwhile either, I never got anything out of the group presentation things as an undergrad, it just seemed like a chance for the lecturers to have a day off! I&#039;d rather have a lecture with someone who&#039;s got more experience than people who are on the course with me- I mean, the reason everyone is here is because they don&#039;t know enough about forensic and investigative psychology!
1,20023,4634,20020,what??
1,20024,4628,19989,no- but can prospective employers say &quot;you cant work for us because your dissertation is in a completely different area&quot;?&gt;
1,20025,4633,19968,will you have to stick with this topic in your career afterwards
1,20026,4623,19865,has anyone else not done any reading yet?!?
1,20027,4633,19942,is it difficult to get through this ethics test?
1,20028,4624,20010,well thhese first weeks arent to odiff i think its more trying to wean us in, so dont worry about it, but i do think 30 is too much, or def only carry that on for 2 weeks, i mean i have to work too but  at the endd of the day this course, my marks and my health come first, if ur really worried go and see the finance department , they will suggest types of funding u can apply for
1,20029,4625,20016,my boss was dead reasonable about hours with me when I asked her, it may be worth a try, if not there&#039;s work going at my place!
1,20030,4623,20023,if you do over 15 hours your breaking your uni terms and conditions or something and you get kicked off
1,20031,4633,19944,Yeah, I also wondering, if I have found a topic I like how will I possibly be able to find subjects to study on
1,20032,4628,20003,****why do you have to do the seminars?? surely if youre not marked on it, it shouldnt matter if you dont do it????
1,20033,4627,20023,not 100% sure but i think that as soon as you work over either 15 or 20 hours you cease to become a full time student.  Its not just the university it is the tax office etc that this applies to...i think
1,20034,4631,20020,Yeah that&#039;s what I&#039;ve heard -  my boss is a horrible, nasty person though and he just doesn&#039;t get it! worried if I make a fuss about my hours he&#039;ll just sack me or give me no hours :s
1,20035,4633,19986,What do you mean?
1,20036,4628,20022,i agree. its pointless
1,20037,4625,20015,I say &#039;ay&#039;
1,20038,4629,20026,nope, goin to try and start this weekend though, u?
1,20039,4633,19949,I like if everybody gets his part and it is not like you are responsible when others don&#039;t fulfill their part
1,20040,4631,20028,Thanks - that&#039;s a really good idea actually, I hadn&#039;t even thought about going there.
1,20041,4625,20034,get a new job with people that understand, my boss is decent, and there are hours going there, but it&#039;s on the wirral
1,20042,4634,20026,not much
1,20043,4628,20014,ye- but how many chapters are in a book? how do we know which aspect of the book to do it on?
1,20044,4625,20040,I think they&#039;ll only be able to offer you hardship funding applications at this point in the year but definitely try!
1,20045,4633,20022,I think it might be really interesting, because you can choose a topic you like, what I don&#039;t like is the idea to dicuss with six or so other people what everyone is doing, that&#039;s annoying
1,20046,4628,20026,absolutely nothing. i feel overwhelmed. dont know wherer to begin...:-(
1,20047,4640,19864,8
2,20048,4639,0,What is the most offensive thing you have ever heard?
2,20049,4639,0,What do you feel are the gaps in your present knowledge base?
2,20050,4639,0,What challenges have you already encountered delivering this material?
2,20051,4639,0,With regard to the workshop being conducted with Muslim groups on the 6th November, what concerns do you have about delivery?
2,20052,4639,0,What do you feel is the basis of the PREVENT strand of contest?
2,20053,4639,0,What is your understanding of prevention and early intervention?
2,20054,4639,0,How would you respond to accusations that this is &#039;spying on the Muslims&#039;?
1,20055,4651,20048,John &amp; Edward
1,20056,4649,20048,the term Nitty Gritty
1,20057,4653,20048,it was a t shirt that said &quot;Jesus was a Cunt&quot;
1,20058,4652,20048,police officers being called pigs
1,20059,4648,20048,running training event for gang violence- probation officer said &#039;I think the best thing the police could do is to give them target practice so at least they just kill each other&#039;- said in front of mum who had lost her son to gang violence
1,20060,4652,20048,being told that I was not serious about my career
1,20061,4651,20048,when i first came to loiverpool the first thing anyone said to me as i got of the bus was /what are you looking at you bald cunt&#039; - that was readonly funny though on reflection
1,20062,4654,20048,People are expected to die in Africa.<br />We could only feed 60 children and turned 1000s away to die.
1,20063,4651,20055,i thought that simon is worse
1,20064,4652,20055,what does this mean?  Why is it offensive?
1,20065,4653,20055,who?
1,20066,4653,20049,dont know what I dont know!
1,20067,4652,20049,better understaning of why some Muslims find prevent offensive and others find it useful
1,20068,4649,20049,where I am going with my learning to date and how am I expected to impliment this in my on-going profession.
1,20069,4651,20049,the political landscape, unsure as to the agendas of different agencies, makes me feel anxious
1,20070,4650,20049,I only have the police view point of Prevent. It is very difficult to see how other groups/individuals view the topic.
1,20071,4652,20049,key issues on prevent&#039;s acceptability
1,20072,4648,20049,Specific details on which extremist groups are currently proscribed and why- information on those groups that are seen as legitimate and why
1,20073,4652,20049,how prevent focus has shifted over time and why
1,20074,4653,20049,&quot;muslim&quot; view on what prevent is - bearing in mind there are numerous different forms of Islam
1,20075,4651,20049,terminology
1,20076,4648,20049,Specific information about how the tool is going to be applied across various community settings
1,20077,4649,20049,other learning outcomes of other projects linked to PVE
1,20078,4654,20049,What references we should give to the &#039;Guidance&#039;.  At various times we have spoken about it, given out examples of it, been told not to refer to it at all, been told to refer to it broadly.
1,20079,4652,20049,why robust responses not given to most serious threat to uk security
1,20080,4648,20049,Information about exactly what circumstances agencies are being asked to pass information to the authorities
1,20081,4650,20049,I am not really able to say what my knowledge gaps are as i have never had them evaluated. I feel I have a reasonable understanding, however, this may not be the case.
1,20082,4651,20068,can you give a concrete exmaple of what you mean by implek,entnb- what particulad aspect of implementing do you mean?
1,20083,4651,20071,can you please give an exmaple
1,20084,4653,20081,agree with this
1,20085,4651,20070,do we have this gathered anywhere? Is there sopmewhay of cpaturing this?
1,20086,4651,20073,how has it shifted in your view?
1,20087,4652,20049,would be useful to consier the range of products and where/how they would be helful to the different groups
1,20088,4648,20079,Can you please give an example of a &#039;non-robust&#039; response you have encountered?
1,20089,4649,20082,in day to day intervention with vulnerable young peolpe as well as those already criminalised
1,20090,4651,20074,where might we gather this? How might we gather it?
1,20091,4652,20075,which terminology?
1,20092,4654,20049,How does the Guidance link to the WRAP Workshop
1,20093,4648,20071,Do you feel confident with the content of CONTEST 2?
1,20094,4651,20078,a good one - what DO we vcall it? guidance / tool etc?
1,20095,4652,20076,have seen no evidence so far that there is a coherent response to implementation or even understanding
1,20096,4653,20090,despite what is said it is in my view very much about Islam, therefore, for me the best placed people to explain the prevent implications is the muslim community. So, mosques, community groups etc
1,20097,4651,20066,how does this make you feel - especially in relationship tpo the upcoming workshop?
1,20098,4648,20078,Where is this message coming from?  What (if any) are the reasons given for the different terminology?
1,20099,4652,20085,starting with the acpo prevent implementation plan - both versions (the restricted and the one for partners)
1,20100,4653,20097,no issue, often in my day job I just have to go with the flow
1,20101,4654,20049,WRAP states that Muslim people are the focus for violent extremist recruiters but I keep reading quotes from people in authority that say that the focus for Prevent is not Muslim people
1,20102,4649,20074,there is an obvliouds lack of &#039;muslim input into the PVE agenda especially to do with PVE and Prevent
1,20103,4652,20086,from international to domestic VE
1,20104,4651,20095,i agree - its wooly, inconsistent and diff agencies (dare I say &#039;partners&#039;) are misuing and misinterpreting it
1,20105,4650,20093,I think CONTEST 2 has more issues than contest 1. The CONTEST strat is never going to please everybody. I feel it needs to look at the wider picture that affects the UK for exampl XRW groups. There is a big increase in XRW support.
1,20106,4652,20050,lack of understanding about prevent being spying
1,20107,4650,20050,People just do not want to engage with the agenda
1,20108,4653,20050,not sounding like a racist
1,20109,4649,20050,resistence to learning
1,20110,4649,20050,NIMBY problem
1,20111,4654,20050,Technical difficulties - there are gaps in the E-Learning
1,20112,4651,20050,pre conceived assumptions before i even start - how (and ho w most effectively) do we get round what people MIGHT bring into the room?
1,20113,4653,20050,whats it got to do with me?
1,20114,4648,20050,There appears to be a lack of commitment/ understanding about what Prevention really means and what the project is trying to achieve
1,20115,4652,20050,one event thought we were looking at vulnerability to students dropping out of uni
1,20116,4644,20111,what gaps do you think exist?
1,20117,4649,20112,recognise the likley resistence and be forearmed?
1,20118,4651,20116,persoannly I think the elearing could backfire spectatularly
1,20119,4654,20050,Challenges that some of the behaviours in the Guidance apply to most of the people in the Workshop - this was in Birmingham to a 90% Muslim Group.
1,20120,4648,20108,how does this emerge- what and how do you get drawn into saying something that might be interpreted as such?
1,20121,4648,20118,In what way specifically?
1,20122,4653,20112,making comments about Islam when I clearly have no idea about the religion, have considered buying &quot;Islam for Dummies&quot; from Amazon
1,20123,4649,20112,ridicule fron colleauges who don&#039;t sdee the link with their work and that of the overall contest/Prevent strategy &quot;going off to save the world are you?&quot;
1,20124,4654,20050,Challenges that the Red areas are not Prevent but are illegal behaviour and are obvious referrals to the police.
1,20125,4651,20121,misguided, incorrect and open to interpretation
1,20126,4652,20050,lack of a strategic view on how agencies singly and jointy might work together on the prevent agenda to build on multi agency working and relationships.  This has the potential to improve information flows for the benefit of all (eg Baby P, cornwall children&#039;s services...)
1,20127,4648,20115,oh dear- why do you think they came in so ill informed?
1,20128,4650,20050,The only support offered relates to funding. Many obtain Prevent funding and run a project that relates to other community issues, for example, a community radio station that obtained funding because, &#039;it created a space for people to discuss their issues&#039;. This was a half hour phone in section which obtained &pound;15000 for a community radio station.
1,20129,4644,20123,Do you think there would be any way of increasing colleagues&#039; understanding?
1,20130,4652,20120,one example is suggesting that the &quot;aq inspired&quot; threat is the greatest one facing the UK today re indiscriminate mass murder
1,20131,4649,20112,people/offenders already within the CJS are criminals and hte view that PVE is not about criminalisation tends t oisolate those staff
1,20132,4653,20120,how to you say to the public to be on the look out for groups of males attending outdoor camps - the public know what you are trying to say cause they ask you outright - &quot;you mean muslim groups officer&quot;
1,20133,4654,20050,Challeges from police officers that all suspicions should be reported to the police and not dealt with by organisations internally - this is the message that many officers have been told and what they repeatedly give out in public forums - is this going to addressed?
1,20134,4648,20112,in my experience, it is best for you to introduce the controversy upfront- rather than pretend it isn&#039;t there until it emerges
1,20135,4649,20129,clear messages about the responsibility WE ALL have in relation to this matter
1,20136,4654,20106,Spying is an emotive word but the reality is that police officers are encouraging people to report suspicions they have about community members.
1,20137,4651,20136,well they shouldnt! That iusnt what its about (I think the problme realtes to PREVENT being seen as part of pursue and its not at all
1,20138,4654,20116,Some of the parts do not work yet
1,20139,4648,20124,All prevention activity involves a duty to protect/ duty of care- if illegal behaviour (child abuse, inappropriate sexual contact, etc.) emerged out of preventative work you would have a duty to inform the authorities- this is no different.
1,20140,4649,20120,the use of non stereo typical images of known terrorists to demonstrate the issues
1,20141,4649,20129,reminders of hte atrocities already perptrated without hte need for  &#039;wake up call&#039;
1,20142,4653,20108,but then you get the rdiculous comment by cumbria police that said &quot;we check out all male groups&quot; when clearly cumbria police do not
1,20143,4649,20116,lack of &#039;real&#039; examples
1,20144,4651,20137,as ever - more investment in training for FIRST responders - dont let it all sit with the management level - that is dangerous
1,20145,4652,20128,Agree!  what is emerging is a range of untested funded activities aimed at universal prevent (almost exclusively in Muslim communities)
1,20146,4651,20051,many as above
1,20147,4652,20051,Immediate hostility around prevent rather than the e-learning
1,20148,4649,20051,how well versed are the presenters on Islam
1,20149,4653,20051,my very limited knowledge of Islam
1,20150,4651,20051,it backfiring... that we are not in a postion to be ready to field many of the difficutl questions
1,20151,4648,20051,That the messages are not clear- it is cart before the horse- and is going to backfire
1,20152,4653,20051,not sounding racist
1,20153,4650,20051,it depends on the individuals understanding of PREVENT and how well they support the agenda
1,20154,4649,20051,how to retian focus on the issue of PVE and not islamaphobia
1,20155,4651,20153,do you mean the folk running it or the folk attending (or both?)
1,20156,4654,20051,As mentioned previously many Muslim people look at the behaviours and say they aply to them so should they be being referred - when they are the managers who are potentially going to receive the referrals this is an issue
1,20157,4650,20051,Many questions will be raised about Islam, which I do not have a good understanding of
1,20158,4652,20051,missing the chance to explore what THEY would suggest to protect all communities
1,20159,4651,20156,yes - there is the guidnace and the actual implementation - we do need to think about both
1,20160,4648,20154,It is likely to be an important part to discuss the concerns around Islamaphobia- you may need to bring up the issue from the start
1,20161,4649,20155,both but primarily the poelpe attending who are likley to be coming from a defensive perspective
1,20162,4650,20155,The people attending the event
1,20163,4652,20051,i don&#039;t think this is about Islam - it&#039;s about public protection especially for young people
1,20164,4651,20158,really important point... suggestions as to how this might be done?
1,20165,4654,20051,Although the Guidance has been compared to other groups eg animal rights - none of the common behaviours that are apparent in those groups but not in the original research appear to have been taken in to the Guidance.
1,20166,4649,20156,the message is not one particular issues, rather a combination of some of the &#039;unusual&#039; behaviour
1,20167,4652,20051,are these &#039;representatives&#039; going to be true representatives?  Would other people be better e.g. some women&#039;s groups?
1,20168,4648,20156,Referred to what?  The cops?  Are they ticking reds because if they are there should be concern!  If they are yellows and oranges- than where is the referral going?
1,20169,4651,20165,we need to not beat around the bush... lets be upfornt about what it ios about or we will be open to the (correct) allegation that the other groups are lip service to water an unpalatable message
1,20170,4649,20163,i agree, however it is not just young people who are vulnerable, my 80  year old neighbour recently openly displayed his politacal allegiences which were extreme far right
1,20171,4648,20165,Do you feel able to talk about application more broadly- or do you think it should just be upfront a focus for this event about Violence done in the name of Islam?  Otherwise, why have Muslim community groups and leaders been specifically invited?
1,20172,4654,20166,Is it a number of issues that results in a referral - originally my understanding was that one behaviour demonstrated could result in a referral?
1,20173,4651,20156,how is it different from things like MAPPAs and MARACs - its not is it... its about a duty of care to protect - not shopping in folk who may be open to being on the receiving end of violence
1,20174,4652,20164,to explore upfront concerns about prevent: to explore what THEY would want from something that seeks to protect young people and to consider how this &#039;wishlist&#039; might be delivered: responsibility for delivery and resourcing this.
1,20175,4650,20160,If this is the case then a greater understanding of the subject is needed. I know nothing about the faith and very little about the culture of many people who are subjected to islamaphobia
1,20176,4649,20165,difficult to have the discussion without reference to islamaphobia
1,20177,4654,20166,What systems will organisations use to record referrals which do not relate to young people?  Systems invariably exist for child protection but not adults.
1,20178,4652,20170,indeed - but how many indiscriminate murders has he responsibility for committing or supporting?
1,20179,4649,20160,i agree theier is a need to explore own understanidng

1,20286,4705,20270,Unsure of the football topic but likely to be interview and questionaire based.  If critical incidents examination of command and control incident logs and progress to interviews and perhaps questionaires.

1,20297,4690,20277,I&#039;m also interested in how gun crime offenders are targetted and disrupted prior to shootings/incidents, at the time of an incident and in the aftermath from the viewpoint of the decision making of the SIO
1,20298,4695,20284,what causes decision inertia in certain situations, and possible remedies
1,20299,4707,20199,Difficult to say but it is all &#039;new&#039; and the research topics broaden knowledge and are relevant
1,20300,4704,20290,How my own experiences have guided decisions I have made.

1,20309,4698,20201,Depends on the level of involvement
1,20310,4693,20201,Difficult to say without the facts, maybe a number of issues,
1,20311,4695,20200,relied upon facts, test those facts, ensure accuracy, used past experience of simialr situations and balanced against those outcomes with desired outcomes for new operational matter.<br />I have asked for options and rationale before choosing one option offered.,<br />Occasionally changed a previous decison made, due to legidslation changes that may have challenged previous decision.
1,20312,4689,20201,The chief officer is always ultimately accountable for errors which occur within the organisation and therefore is accountable for the consequences of those errors. You can delegate a responsibility but you can not pass on the accoutability.
1,20313,4687,20199,dont know yet, we&#039;ll see....

1,20319,4687,20201,probably not, it usually takes more than one person in an investigation to make a chain of decisions
1,20320,4687,20199,i would like to be instructed as to HOW EXACTLY to secure a job at the end of this course!
1,20321,4690,20200,I have been dealing with an extrnely complex case recently over a period of 20 months. I lost my focus for a 3 week period and tried to investigate everything ! I re- focused using traning, peerr review and thematic bullet points (which are in the manual) and lost nothing, gaining really valauble  experience. I&#039;m not as good as I think I am , nor am I as bad.
1,20322,4700,20200,Decision to take child into care despite representations to the contrary from social services
1,20323,4704,20200,Tasking out the arrest of six individuals for murder, to preserve any possible evidence, knowing that there was little evidence at the time and there was a possibility of civil action/criticism later on.  I used a previous experience where evidence was lost because of my delay.
1,20324,4708,20315,The decision was based around the assessment of his current threat (now all quiet) the perceived lack of threat to himself(the subject) apart from if we intervened with a firearms team which would then entail a threat to both the subject and the firearms officers.  He was arrested the next day by unarmed officers.
1,20325,4697,20295,The people who are responsible for applying blame or fault MUST have operational exeperience in the same fileld.
1,20326,4693,20295,It depends on what police are being accountable for. ie  bad decisions or bad procedure.  Better support from higher level , public confidence
1,20327,4695,20201,depends on where the chain of decision errors occur, and if all errors were fed back to the individual person.<br />Decision makers are accountable which is why it is imperative to record decisions and rationale
1,20328,4688,20199,i think more info on possibilities for dissertations, how and where to collect data
1,20329,4700,20201,One person should be accountable in my view, but everyone is responsible who had a part in the investigation
1,20330,4687,20199,more guidance on how to go about dissertations
1,20331,4696,20325,can you explain the reasons that it would be better?
1,20332,4688,20330,yes please!
1,20333,4696,20326,so a focus on process - how achived? How does confidence fit into this picture?
1,20334,4699,20326,In your opinion,  what are police being held to account for most often, bad decisions or bad procedures?
1,20335,4710,20304,what did you base your decision on- past experience? training? a manual?
1,20336,4687,20330,YES! i havnt a notion on what im doing it on or how to approach it. i need one to one help
1,20337,4710,20322,why did you make this choice?
1,20338,4704,20201,No. There are always both systematic and personal reasons. Has that person been reliable in the past or not? If not, why have they not been dealt with before and if they have been, what went wrong this time.
1,20339,4688,20330,I know, im concerned about how to come up with a topic that will be relavent, interesting and useful to me
1,20340,4695,20295,public perception of police accountability os often higher than police, whereby public are quick to appoint blame, yet police are not as quick to explain.
1,20341,4700,20295,Culturally the organisation looks for a scapegoat. As everything is a priority we take too long to learn from our organisational mistakes
1,20342,4709,20201,Typical police always someone to blame so others can bask in their failure and feel smug that it wasnt their fault.  The question should be &#039;why wasn&#039;t the process robust enough to highlight inadequacies at an earlier stage&#039;.  However if there has been obvious incompetancy then some action must be taken.
1,20343,4690,20201,I would remain open minded  and would need more facts before I could form an opinion. Tragedy can result from things which someone may have experienced many years ago which can lead to poor decision making/opinion or simply that they have not been challenged appropriately. Also there could have been a wide variety of factors, which, without looking at in detail with a mind to the whole event, and, outcome may not seem relevant in isolation.
1,20344,4687,20330,i have never written one but when the time comes i dont think ill know what to do
1,20345,4697,20200,Decision to give a group of Afghan protesters a &#039;reality check&#039; on day seven of a siege.<br />Drew on training and intuition.
1,20346,4695,20334,a balance of both, but usually procedures as a decision is often better than no decision
1,20347,4687,20330,i have never done a dissertation and dont think that ill know how to when the time comes
1,20348,4690,20295,It is difficult to challenge senior officers around decision making. internet forums are useful but focused operational debriefs, anonymised by something like this may be unrealistic with time but really impactive and positive on investigative culture
1,20349,4687,20199,JOBS PLEASE!?!?!
1,20350,4712,20295,Things always hone down to one or two individuals rather than group failure.  We are not good at debriefing success.  If we were you may find that the target individual has a record of success up to that date.  We dont have track record keeping.

2,20352,4741,0,What was your overall experience of the trainign exercise Op Sanc?
1,20353,4768,20352,long, boring &amp; tedious at times
1,20354,4769,20352,it was an enjoyable experience, and an overall good learning one too
1,20355,4776,20352,it was more sedentary than I expected
2,20356,4741,0,What did you find most surprising?
1,20357,4771,20352,It was an interesting experience seeing the operation that goes on surrounding an incident of that nature
1,20358,4777,20352,It was a nice insight into how the police deal with hostage situations.
1,20359,4772,20352,A very interesting experience, a little tiring but was worth it. Would take part again.
1,20360,4775,20352,It was a very interesting experience to be in that situation. It was a lot quieter than I thought it would be!
1,20361,4774,20352,a very interesting exercise, and i am glad to have been involved
1,20362,4770,20352,interesting. i thought the exwecise was worth while as a participant. i was never bored
1,20363,4773,20352,it was interesting to see the type of procedures that the police use during a simulated hostage situation
1,20364,4769,20352,good learning experience, but i expected to be more involved as a hostage
1,20365,4778,20352,Overall, it was enjoyable but withy an event that runs for that long and at that time of day there will obviously be moments when it gets boring.
2,20366,4741,0,What did you learn about yourself?
1,20367,4777,20352,Sometimes it did not need to last as long as it should have.
1,20368,4769,20362,defo worthwhile...this one goes on the CV
2,20369,4741,0,What was your view of the negotiators?
1,20370,4771,20352,not as tough as i thought i expected it to be more aggressive and the situation on the bus to run continually
1,20371,4768,20363,parts of the set up and the time spend waiting, inspired time to talk &amp; comment on police procedures
1,20372,4775,20367,Yeah sometimes it felt like we were &quot;padding it out&quot; just to make it last a bit longer
1,20373,4776,20354,it was unnerving once negotiations were via the &#039;ink&#039;? insofar as the out of line of sight set up undermined normal intuitive trust. I have wondered since what damage this would cause to rapport established earlier in a real hostage scenario
1,20374,4774,20352,personally didn&#039;t find it boring, but can understand how others did
1,20375,4772,20364,I agree with this, I expected to be more involved as well
1,20376,4778,20355,How so?
1,20377,4777,20364,The situations were surreal at times as well.
1,20378,4769,20363,i dont think that anything was revealed at all, we were so far removed from it that we hadnt a clue what was going on
1,20379,4778,20355,How so?
1,20380,4770,20366,that i am a scaredycat
1,20381,4778,20357,What do you think you&#039;ve learned from that?
2,20382,4741,0,What was your role on the night (hostage or hostage taker)? What was your view of the hostage/hostage taker (depending on what you played?)
1,20383,4776,20370,I found it virtually impossibly to be tough
1,20384,4773,20371,But it wasnt supposed to be an exercise for us to learn psychologically what happens during a hostage situation. we were merely tools for the police
1,20385,4778,20364,How would you have liked to be more involved?
1,20386,4771,20372,does that not just make it more realistic?...in a real life situation you would be under constant pressure in the bus and so it probably seemed longer because it was sitting around chatting not sitting in a real life situation
1,20387,4775,20373,Yeah once the machine was set us as a &quot;hostage&quot; you felt a little bit forgotten and abandoned...especially as you couldnt hear what thepolice were sayin on the bus
1,20388,4769,20356,the fact that it took the police so long to respond the 1st night...i think we were waiting for about 90mis for anything to happen
1,20389,4770,20356,the responses of the police. i thought the negociators were slow and unimpressive.
2,20390,4741,0,Can you suggest 2 improvements for future Merseyside training events? (This debrief will be used in our feedback report for them)
1,20391,4776,20370,I wasn&#039;t convinced that the ending of night one was at all realistic which detracted from the exercise as a whole
1,20392,4769,20366,that i love action and excitement! i wanted someone to get killed
2,20393,4741,0,Can you suggest 2 improvements for future Merseyside training events? (This debrief will be used in our feedback report for them)
1,20394,4773,20364,Isn&#039;t that a bit unrealistic, as the exercise was for the police, not for us to learn as psychologists!
1,20395,4768,20376,a lot of time was spent sitting and waiting for something to happen.<br />whether it was to wait for the police to do something or the hostage takers to make their next move
1,20396,4770,20389,hope i never get taken hostage!! i have no hope of them getting me out!
1,20397,4771,20391,what do you think would have been more realistic?
1,20398,4777,20386,Probably might be better if we weren&#039;t allowed to sit and chat, to make it seem as if all the waiting was necessary.
1,20399,4769,20369,after they implimented the phone and speaker thing, we couldnt hear a thing. before that though, i dont think the negotiators were very good at all
1,20400,4774,20389,the lack of information coming from the police, at times it felt like they weren&#039;t doing much
1,20401,4773,20356,How long it took for the the police to react to the situation after the first response had noted a hostage situation was at hand
1,20402,4772,20388,I agree, it was such a long wait
1,20403,4771,20396,but we couldnt see what was going on behind the scenes i guess??
1,20404,4775,20356,I was suprised as to how inactive you are as a hostage (although in retrospect it makes sense)
1,20405,4768,20384,yes... but the mere fact that the police would only move forward once the hostage taker would challenge them with something now, gave the impression that nothing was going on at times
1,20406,4769,20399,&quot;what happened at the racecourse??&quot;
1,20407,4775,20356,I was suprised at how quickly you start to feel like the police arent doing much for you and also how sometimes the police seemed to miss glaring obvious clues (maybe we just didnt see them pick up on them??)
1,20408,4773,20369,I think the negotiators were awful. If that was the actual response of a realy life negotiator I would not be surprised if all the hostages died.
1,20409,4770,20369,slow didnt seem too worried about the hostages but were concerned about what had gone on prior to the hostage taking - at the racecourse!!
1,20410,4777,20389,They seemed to be following a tight script constantly.
1,20411,4769,20382,i thought that the main guy played the hostage taker very well, and it was very realistic
1,20412,4776,20363,the difference between the two negotiator teams was marked; whereas the first team seemed more nervous than the hostage takers the second undoubtedly assumed a more commanding (convincing) position from their arrival.  Having said that they clearly were at something of an advantage insofar as they would have arrived having had a briefing whereas the first team arrived &#039;cold&#039;.
1,20413,4769,20409,&quot;what happened at the racecourse??&quot;
1,20414,4774,20407,agreed. i&#039;m sure they were doing alot behind the scenes, but it didnt appear that way, and part of the polices role is to reassure as well
1,20415,4775,20366,That I can scream very loudly
1,20416,4770,20382,paul was brilliant what a psycho!!
1,20417,4777,20356,I&#039;m surprised at how good the lead hostage taker was at acting.
1,20418,4778,20356,The fact that is sometimes felt like negotiators were missing obvious cues for building rapport. For example, at one point a negotiator asked one of the hostage takers if everyone on the bus was ok and the HT replied &#039;no&#039;. Instead of following this up by asking who was injured, the neg followed a different line of inquiry.
1,20419,4773,20382,My role was as a hostage. I thought the hostage takers executed their role extremely well. It is just a shame that that was the only role that was executed well, as the negotiators seemed far more redundant
1,20420,4769,20390,i dont think that the police negotiators responsed very quickly at all... did they know that it was a simulation? if so, perhaps they shouldnt know.
1,20421,4778,20400,How did that make you feel?
1,20422,4771,20382,the hostage takers played the roles well
1,20423,4774,20382,played a hostage taker, was interesting to shout abuse at the police, try to wind them up, yet their responses were always calm and dignified, really good work by them, well done!
1,20424,4775,20409,It felt a lot like the were just plodding along at a very slow pace - they seemingly missed a lot of clues - eg they kept on asking if anyone was hurt over and over again, but the main hostage taker had already said three times &quot;someone has been hurt&quot; and &quot;we need a first aid kit&quot;.
1,20425,4776,20363,I was surprised that the hostage taker was not aware where his weapons were at all times; exercise/inoperable weapons or not I felt uncomfortable about it.
1,20426,4777,20366,That even in a mock situation, I cannot be completely relaxed.
1,20427,4770,20390,i feel like as a hostage and a participant there wasnt enough information provided about what my role was to be prior to the event
1,20428,4780,20366,did nobody learn anything else?
1,20429,4773,20390,They could implement more training in hostage situations. I do not think the mersey tunnel situation represented a plausible situation for a hostage situation to occur.
1,20430,4778,20407,Do you have any specific examples of this?
1,20431,4772,20408,They were slow, just kept asking about the racecourse - wouldn&#039;t it be better to save the hostages first and then concentrate on the failed robbery?
1,20432,4768,20390,the set up of the bus, tunnel and positioning left many gaps in the realism of the situation. The fact that the hostage taker had to walk such a long way to the speaker box would have never happened in real life
1,20433,4772,20382,The main hostage taker was particularly impressive!
1,20434,4773,20390,I feel the hostages were not provided enough information about the situation and task they were meant to perform. This I believe led to a lack of realism
1,20435,4777,20408,I agree, most of the second group died. But the first group had less fatalities.
1,20436,4774,20366,where the toilets are in the tunnel
1,20437,4768,20432,it would have been better to force the police to think of an alternative plan in order to communicate with him, rather than him change his behaviour to suit the situation
1,20438,4777,20424,The first aid kit was an apple.
1,20439,4769,20394,no, i dont think its unrealistic at all. i dont think that we should have been more involved as psychologists, i think though as &quot;hostages&quot; we should have been more involved. for example, as it would be in a real hostage negotiation
1,20440,4778,20366,I learned that in a situation like this, it makes a huge difference to be surrounded by people who would support you and to support one another (and that&#039;s only in a mock situation, imagine what it must be like in reality!).
1,20441,4770,20427,perhaps a document explaining the backstory to the event, what will be expected from me as a participant and how i wil be expected to act would have been useful
1,20442,4775,20391,yeah when I was released off the bus I was given intstructions of how to act and what to say and when I reached the police they were just stood there chatting which was quite strange as I was told to leave in character. And then they wanted to take statements in character...it was hard to jump between the two
1,20443,4774,20366,that in a real situation like that, its best to leave it to someone who knows what they&#039;re doing, and that being a have-a-go hero isn&#039;t worth it!
1,20444,4771,20434,I disagree...I felt we were told about the role we needed to play at the right moment...ie when i do this scream...the situation is an ever changing one and the hostage taker was being fed information about what to do next and therefore it would have been difficult to tell us at the start what was expected of us
1,20445,4773,20393,Invest more time devising a logical and plausible hostage situation, ensuring that the situation is not flawed before the simulation even begins.
1,20446,4776,20356,I formed the distinct impression that the officer from the tunnel police who responded initially was actually about to discharge CS gas if the swearing hadn&#039;t intimidated him.
1,20447,4777,20382,Played a hostage, the hostage takers gave it that much more realism!
1,20448,4778,20369,I was involved in night two, and it often felt like negotiators were not being specific enough about how equipment works etc so that it was difficult to communicate with them at times.
1,20449,4769,20391,i agree with this. it felt like they were just trying to wrap things up. as a whole, the start of the negotiation dragged on, and the end just seemed to be raced through
1,20450,4778,20369,Again, negotiators missed vital cues that would have allowed them to build rapport and would have provided them with more vital information.
1,20451,4776,20356,The use of a &#039;professional&#039; standard actor was impressive and, I daresay, crucial, in introducing a level of realism to the exercise that made it worthwhile. Without such a &#039;fine performance&#039; the whole exercise could be seriously undermined in terms of effectiveness.
1,20452,4769,20410,definately. very unassuring!
1,20453,4772,20395,I guess that&#039;s how it would be in a real situation though, lots of waiting...
1,20454,4777,20427,Definately more information was required on what we should expect and what kinds of things we are likely to be asked to get involved in.
1,20455,4775,20382,I was a hostage. The people playing the hostage takers had a really hard job but pulled it off really well. They made it feel a lot more realistic, especially when dragging us around and screaming
1,20456,4773,20424,it felt like more attention was being focused on the actual racecourse crime itself than caring for the civilian lives that were endangered.
1,20457,4770,20421,its funny because at the time the situation was so real to me, i was annoyed at the negociators, like we had just got in the way and they werent bothered
1,20458,4776,20366,can&#039;t say I learnt anything; it merely confirmed what I already knew ..... not destined for the stage!!
1,20459,4777,20429,But it was nice as you can keep constant conditions. But yes probably lacked a little realism.
1,20460,4774,20434,throw an unpredicted event into the equation, a pregnant lady, an attempt to escape through the emergency exits, anything to keep the negotiators on their toes!
1,20461,4769,20390,to be honest, i dont see hostage negotiations a job for the police, i see it as a job for psychologists. people speciailsed in human behviour
1,20462,4772,20398,Yeah if we had been told to be quiet and not to talk with each other, and maybe even tied up, it would have made it a lot more realistic
1,20463,4768,20407,whether it is part of SOP or not, but the police should focus on having a presence for the hostages, so they feel at ease and don&#039;t start &#039;losing hope&#039;
1,20464,4780,20436,bet you never knew there were so many refuges down there!
1,20465,4775,20352,being able to see how the main hostage taker on night 2 dealt with things, and him explaining that by saying this the police would be doing this this and this was really interesting. It made my realise how much goes on behind the scenes that you dont ever get to see!
1,20466,4772,20449,When I got released and walked to the police only my fellow hostage was there to greet me, the police weren&#039;t interested at all, they didn&#039;t want a statement or asked what the situation on the bus was like.
1,20467,4771,20448,i agree with this when going to speak to the board thingy the negotiators missed several opportunities to explain that you cant both speak.  It was clear this is what was happening as it was clicking in mid sentence
1,20468,4775,20420,But then maybe thats how quickly they can respond in real life? Its not like you can just rush in and make rash decisions - people die that way
1,20469,4769,20444,i disagree. yes, we were told to &quot;scream now&quot;, that isnt realistic though. i think what the other person meant was that as a whole, and overall, we hadnt a clue what was going on. we knew nothing about any preivious crime performed (in the racecourse??), we didnt know whether the police negotiators knew that it was a simulation, etc
1,20470,4772,20457,I was very annoyed with the negotiators
1,20471,4775,20454,I dont think we should have been warned about what to expect! Thats no realistic is it! Maybe a character sheet would have been good though! Also, maybe not allowing us to socialise on the bus to make it more realistic from our pov
1,20472,4769,20460,yes, but we werent given this opertunity. we wernt briefed and told &quot;guys, do what you would do in a real hostage situation&quot;
1,20473,4768,20432,further, the acoustics inside the tunnel were really bad... which should have forced the police to think of different options at the early stages. this would provide some novel and on-the-spot thinking, to come up with solutions.
1,20474,4781,20370,What dis you expect in the way of toughness?
1,20475,4773,20459,Surely that&#039;s the biggest ciriticism- in a real life context controlled condition are the one aspect that shouldnt be controlled as they represented the actualities of a hostage situation. Whilst it was evident why the tunnel was closed, the confounding factors would be the factors that shape the hostage situation
1,20476,4778,20382,I was a hostage taker and on the plus I agree that negotiators managed to stay calm despite the fact that we gave them a pretty hard time. On the down side, I also felt frustrated at how they interacted with me at points with conversations being stinted. When I was due to leave the bus toward the end of the night, the neg was good at delivering the method for how this would be achieved and remained calm. He did make one slip in failing to reassure me at one point, but aside from that he was very good here.
1,20477,4774,20369,i figured alf of their job is behind the scenes, but the other half is to appear that they are in control of the situation and doing everything they can to resolve the situation safetly, this second bit wasn&#039;t seen from the hostages on the bus
1,20478,4777,20439,I agree, in real hostage situations, the conditions may change rapidly at times and the behaviour of hostages can be unpredictable.
1,20479,4769,20458,i agree with you. learned nothing at all. was so unmoved and far removed from the thing that it was almost a waste of a night
1,20480,4775,20460,A fuller briefing and deriefing on the night would have been good - on the second night we werent really told to stay or go, just kind of ignored.<br />And secondly, maybe a better location - I understand why you used the tunnel, but its highly unlikely to happen
1,20481,4773,20476,surely staying calm is a necessity- id be worried if they panicked. On the first night the negotiators did panic. They left in a hurry leaving all their situation papers all over the tunnel.
2,20482,4741,0,Did you feel your welfare needs were met thoughoutt he night (bearing in mind the constraints of the exercise)?
1,20483,4776,20369,Definitely mixed.  There were significant differences between the approaches of the two teams.  The first team appeared to be lacking in experience and, consequently, confidence.  Nevertheless, to give them credit they were willing to compromise with the hostage taker about things which didn&#039;t matter; in particular, swapping roles between active and observer which certainly appeased the hostage taker considerably.  The hostage taker had a plan to ridicule the original lead negotiator and he appeared to give up on that plan rather than transfer it to the original observer when she took over.<br />In the tunnel where acoustics are clearly problematic the potential confusion caused by different accents was both acute and obvious.  In a real situation accents could become a real issue; it was extremely difficult to hear what they were saying.
1,20484,4774,20450,i thought they didn&#039;t do a bad job of building rapport, but thay did miss vital info and didn&#039;t always respond to the more pressing needs like first aid etc
1,20485,4777,20391,It appeared only situation at the bus was made to be real, anything up at the police end discontinued to be so.
1,20486,4769,20471,we should have AT LEAST been told &quot;guys, you were on a bus on your way home from the racecourse when... bla bla bla&quot;... we werent told anything of the sort.
1,20487,4771,20482,we were almost too well looked after i think! things like being let go to the toilet and i probably ate my body weight in food!
1,20488,4773,20482,yes I think our welfare was met throughout the whole exercise. We were treated better than I thought we would and supplied with enough resourses to sustain the nights exercise. Overall I was very impressed by our treatment.
1,20489,4775,20482,definatly! Im still eating the food you gave me! Plus, we were told to dress warmly (which we wouldnt have been had we just been the races!!) and you cant control for the temperature. I was a lot more taken care of than I expected!
1,20490,4768,20482,it didn&#039;t help to the parked right next to the running water inside the tunnel, hearing the sound constantly... while trying not to run to the toilet every few mins!
1,20491,4778,20420,Equipment improvement. The speaker that was set up so that negs weren&#039;t in the line of fire was a bit awkward. The fact that when negs were talking this prevented them from being able to hear what H or HTs were saying is surely a bit of a design flaw. Also, it makes the person trying to speak to the neg more frustrated when they have to wait for the neg to stop speaking before they can say their bit.
1,20492,4770,20461,after seeing what happened at the event i completely agree! i was shocked by their attempts to &#039;manage&#039; the situation
1,20493,4777,20482,We were surprisingly well looked after with food and drinks and even opportunities to go to the toilet. The conditions were not too cold as we were in the tunnel which was good.
1,20494,4771,20482,definately well looked after
1,20495,4768,20489,some people even brought their own comfy blankets!
1,20496,4771,20482,i thought we were going to have to negotiate food etc and it would have to be brought in by the police
1,20497,4772,20482,We were treated really well, made me almost want to stay with the hostage takers
1,20498,4769,20482,yes, very well looked after. no complaints or improvements needed there
1,20499,4769,20497,stolkhome syndrome or cheap student!?!
1,20500,4773,20499,defo cheap student!!
1,20501,4769,20495,haha!
1,20502,4771,20390,thought about doing a boat on the Mersey as another exercise?  might be a challenging one?
1,20503,4775,20474,I thought it would be tougher - both physically and mentally - although I suppose there is only so much you can inflict on people ethically...
1,20504,4773,20495,and sushi!
1,20505,4778,20482,The police were great in ensuring that all of our welfare needs were met. The downside of this is that as hostages we felt a little less immersed. However, given all the laws about health and safety etc, I guess our needs had to be met (not that I&#039;m saying I wish we&#039;d all been manhandled and mistreated!).
1,20506,4774,20497,as an exercise, we were very well catered for , so thanks for that! in a hostage situation, would all that stuff be negotiated in?
1,20507,4770,20497,my only criticism was that i think the hostage takers should have stayed in character the whole time to keep us intimidated
1,20508,4776,20382,hostage taker.<br />I thought the hostages played their roles well when they were in role.  However on our night the double decker bus proved a logistic hindrance to scenario immersion.  The hostages were up top and the hostage takers on the lower deck planning strategies. This was exaccerbated by the (to some extent) inevitable calls to the exercise controller. I think it would have been much better, at least from that point of view, to have had the hostages in a more confined area.

1,20613,4800,20518,Establish a number of strategies that will support me in establishing: who the victim is, how he came to be at that location, how he sustained the injuries, what was the cause of death and if relevant who is responsible.<br />These strategies will be based around and overarching Investigation strategy incorporating the following:<br />Victim<br />Scene/Forensic<br />Witnesses<br />Suspects<br />Intelligence<br />Fast Track HP Actions<br />CCTV<br />Media<br />Resources
1,20614,4805,20518,I am the SIO. I have been advised of an incident at Jubilee Street and Coronation Street, Bootle. UIM 1 has been found slumped in a rear alley of Jubilee and Coronation, suffering head injuries and heavily bloodstained. He has been pronounced dead. This will be treated as murder and I will devise startegies around the investigation. It will be run using MIRSAP. Witnesses have been identified, scenes have been identified and further searches will be required to identify forensic opportunities and potential attack site. I will utilises a policy book and outline forensic, H2H, scene, search, telecoms, FLO and media strategies. The deceased is as yet UK. No offender or weapon has yet been identified. A scene has been secured but further discoveries have identified further scenes are probable.  Forensic opportunites will be paramount and serches must be prioritised.
1,20615,4801,20518,The victim has sustained a head injury and is heavily blood stained. The initial assessment and in the absence of any further information would suggest that the deceased has died as a result of the injury. The circumstances surrounding how he came by those injuries are unclear. At this stage the death is unexplained. My initial assessment would be to treat the matter as suspicious until such time as the facts can be established to either support or negate this assessment.<br />The people present at the scene must all be considered significant to the investigation. In the absence of any information to the contrary, they would be treated as significant witnesses.
1,20616,4804,20518,Initial assessment that an unexplained death has occured, initial actions at scene require reviewing and strategies put in place for the investigation, forensic examination and recovery of evidence, communication and media strategy along with a community impact assessment, and key individuals and opinion formers within the community require contacting and informing. As SIO a number of high priority actions are to be raised to secure and preserve evidence, progress the investigation and the identification of the deceased.<br />The deceased has been found with head injuries, the time of death has yet to be established along with any other assocaited scenes, should this not be the location of any offences and the death. Consideration is to be given to this being a &#039;dump site.&#039;

1,20625,4799,20520,1. Forensic Strategy - early recovery of scientific evidence will assist investigation and avoid loss of evidence - maximise opportunities to arrest and detect offence.<br />2. Investigation Strategy - maximise CCTV recovery/Key witness statements - to enable the scenario to be determined - early recording of evidence which may prevent later loss - H2H enquiries to identify further key witnesses - may assist to time stamp activity if heard/seen.<br />Scene searches - to enable te effective searching and recovery of evidence<br />3. Press and media - early media appeal may provide witnesses/information that can be acted upon in a time critical manner. May assist to identify victim and provide a sequence of events for victim etc - Movements of victim may be pivotal to investigation
1,20626,4802,20519,1. Intelligence. At this time the deceased identity has not been established and therefore motive, associates, criminal lifestyle have not been identified. My first priority would be to establish the identity of the deceased, which may lead to a motive, identify offenders (early arrests and securing evindece), idenify further scenes, SOE. Intelligence on 3 witnesses / who may be suspects subject to checks.<br />2 Forensic. Scene needs to be approriately cordoned (outdoor scene)and preserved. I would consider pathologist attending the scene and CSM and scientist for blood distribution/ footwear. Is this the murder scene or deposition site.<br />3 Key witnesses Three key witnesses are known to date I would set a witness strategy regarding statements, seizure of clothing, forensic examination re conatct with the deceased, telephonic enquires.
1,20627,4800,20520,Victim - Who the victim is, his bakcgroun and movements to and from that sscene and any intelligence that maybe available. This will possibley enable me to establish a motive and certainly assist in plotting the movements of N1  to review any CCTV and identify any witnesses<br />Scene - Again to establish scene parameters that will afford me the opportunity to identify any possible forensic recovery that will identify persons present at that scene or in contact with the victim and pursue a forensic strategy<br />Media - To enable me to inform the local and wider community of what has happened, what the police and Investigation Team are doing  to provide re-assurance and finally to appeal for witnesses who may have seen or heard anything or have information that may progress the investigation.
1,20628,4803,20520,1/ Scene - Chance to achieve best evidence from both scenes - cannot get it back and is crucial in sequence of events. Lockharts law applies - so also best chance to evidence suspect at scene and commiting offence (or disproving other suspects involvement)<br />2/  CCTV this may show victim/suspect/ offence - witnesses (are they telling the truth) - if none then can move on to other priorities<br />3/ Victim - 5 WH - motive movements last night, background    (witnesses AIB and can verify verbal accounts already given) enqs with vicitm may quickly identify suspect/motive and may require HP action to preserve scene/offender elsewhere - offender may be in process of forensically decontaminating them selves or establishing alibi
1,20629,4801,20519,Victim Identification : At this stage the victim is unknown. The identification of the victim would generate lines of enquiry in terms of lifestyle, background, family, criminal history, associates and potential movements in the hours before death.<br />Scene Management : Integrity of the scene is paramount during the initial stages of the investigation. Clearly there are opportunities for forensic recovery and therefore the preservation of the scene, which would include the body/ambulance and throughfare are vital. This stategy would ensure that scene preservation maximises all opportunities for forensic recovery.<br />Witness Management : The significant individuals at the scene must be treated in a manner that maximises the evidence that they may provide. At the same time, remaining open minded in terms of their involvement in the incident.
1,20630,4804,20519,1. Investigation Strategy - fundermental strategy to provide the focus and direction of the investigation in line with the force strategic goals and the improve the &#039;confidence&#039; which the community have in the police to investigate the offence and protect public etc.<br />2. Forensic Strategy - To ensure maximum recovery of frorensic yield from any forensic evidence gathering opportunity. To ensure evidence is secured and preserved, and retrieved lawfully and with integrity to ensure that forensic science can progress the investigation and provide admissible evidence as to the facts of the offence.<br />4. Interview strategy - to provide support to any witnesses identified within the investigation, ensuring that key and vulnerable witnesses are supported and feel confident to provide evidence. To ensure any suspects within the investigation are interviewed in a lawfully according to PACE and any evidence from interview is admissible. The interview strategy will ensure the facts are obtained and tested to corroberate witnesses accounts.
1,20631,4805,20519,Scene<br />Forensic<br />Witness<br />Scene is priority because although UIM 1 is found by the alley gates, this may not be the attack site and may be a dump site. UIM 1 should be considered a scene at this stage. I would also consider witness Jenkins as a scene due to cross transference. Further examination has identified further blood staining so further scenes may be identified. The ambulance carrying the deceased is also a scene and should be retained. Without identifying scenes, the following forensic strategy is incomplete.<br />Forensic - Blood staining and footprints in blood have been identified. This must be preserved and seized before potential damage is caused. The witness Jenkins should be considered as a forensic scene. Ambo and dump site also subject of forensic exam. Ambo attendants should have footwear taken<br />Witness startegy. Jenkins is first at scene but must consider he may be involved. Witnesses Jones and Smith are also HP actions along with Littler and Whittle.
1,20632,4803,20521,HP TIE Joey Cubby - intel/H/A - family/girlfriend associates nearby - He may be watching what is going on<br />left scene and disposed of clothing/footwear/swabs<br />TST witness Kenyon - Obtain warrant for<br />46 Violet Way (what was everyone wearing - previous history etc) - may be hostile/uncooperative<br />TST witnesses Mathews/Reynolds (same re above - history )<br />ID where they would have gone to buy tobacco - route - CCTV<br />POLSA - expand parameters and enlist assistance of POLSA team/air support re route/scene and possible site for weapon<br />Scene still to be priotised<br />H/A of vicitm - preserve - ID other family/witnesses consider 3rd scene - may have happened there
1,20633,4800,20521,Again main priority is still victim and confirming who he is and why he was beaten up.<br />My priority now would also link into Witness strategy and I would HP Actions to research all named individuals in paper feed, at this stage interview them as witnesses, retrieve all clothing and footwear worn by them and obtain a Section 8 warrant for 46 Violet Way and also the home address of the victim, 36 Jubilee Street. This would be with the objective of securing any evidence/ blood stained clothing/ documentation that may assist me in establishing a motive to attack N1 or retrieve any evidence that may assist me in identifying who is responsible.<br />I would also now develop my Forensic strategy with a view to FSS scientists attending scene to provide me with expert advice and guidance.
1,20634,4805,20521,Yes. Now consider fast track action TIE Cubby.<br />Scene strategy still priority but CSI are now in attendance. The unprovenanced intelligence from Kenyon has identified a potential suspect in Cubby. He was last person seen with the deceased and was acting aggressively.<br />Witness strategy extended to Kenyon, Matthews and Reynolds as fast track actions  to T/ST<br />Source tasking and Intelligence research re all individuals.<br />Now FLO strategy re contact with NOK and identification of UIM1 possibly Martin.<br />Passive data trawl in area for movements of individuals in this area.<br />H2H parametres to be set from Violet Way to scene<br />Search strategy POLSA assistance to set parametres and search of Martin&#039;s h/a to preserve evidence and ssist in identification
1,20635,4802,20521,1. Forensic remains Main LOE. Initial assessement is that the alleyway is the location of the assault. Key items murder weapon (hammer) outstanding consider extending scene / polsa search of surrounding alleyway and area. Footwear impressions on deceased, at scene and in blood. Need to ensure all attedning officers, paramdic and witness footwear has been seized for elimination.

Cubby will now form part of intelligence stratgey and he needs to be TIE as suspects. Further significant witnesses have now been idenitifed.
1,20636,4801,20521,Although the initial priorities remain in place, these will be extended to take into account the new information. There are now further potential scenes identified. In addition there are other individuals that are identified as potentially being key to the investigation.<br />Priorities :<br />1. Continue to formally identify the victim. in the event the vitim is identified as Martin, secure and preserve the home address for forensic examination and search.<br />2. Secure and preserve 46 Violet Way, Bootle for forensic examination and search.<br />3. Research Kenyon with a view to T&amp;I<br />4. Research Cubby with a view to T&amp;I<br />5.

1,20637,4799,20521,Priority is now to research and corroborate the information supplied to the PCSO and to TIE the male Cubby.<br />Consideration needs to be to develop the information with a view to the arrest of this male. Statements from Kenyon, Matthews and Reynolds.<br />Cubby is now suspected of being in the company of the deceased immediately before the body was found<br />An arrest strategy will be develped with a supporting search strategy for premises under his control and underpinned by a forensic strategy in respect of the male Cubby to maximise te opportunity to recover key evidence. Consideration to be given to determining a SOE for te suspect.<br />The clothing known to have been worn by the suspect can be refined through witness evidence<br />Research into his background, criminality and associates will be undertaken
1,20638,4804,20521,Priorities remain the same, however addtional high priority actions are to be raised regarding the interview of Timmy Kenyon and the full research of intelligence systems regarding all named and locations within the additional information, and if approriate after research to TST nominals. Given there is intelligence to suggest N1 had been at 46 Violet Way 75 mins prior to being found, a search warrant under Sec 8 PACE is to be executed to secure and preserve any evidence within the address. Consideration is now being given to a potential second scene and reviewing and extending the original scene parameters to taken any routes from Violet Way to the site N1 was found.

1,20650,4805,20523,As part of investigative strategy, identify offender and bring to justice. Cubby has been put forward as potential suspect. To confirm or negate his part in death of N1 SIO must consider forensic opportunities. Scenes must be identified to provide the widest range of forensic yield to detect this crime. Witnesses must be interviewed to obtain evidence to be adduced and consideration be given as to their vulnerability or veracity.

The early arrest of this suspect will potentially enable the recovery of key evidence, also may frustrate suspect in creating false alibi and disposing of key evidence. Will allow early interviews and explore any account given. May allow innocent person to exonerate themselves and enquiry t mve on<br />2. Key witnesses - statements to record key elements and will enable a secario to be developed - allow SOE to be determined.<br />3.

This will impact on confidence and satissfaction in the long terms and assist in the building of relationships between investigators and family. This will help provide background information and general lifesyle in order to idnetify as yet unidentified associates.<br />Research into significant individuals will help in decision making in terms of whether they have the propensity to commit acts of violence.It will also provide a picture in terms of their lifestyle/background.<br />Crime Scene examinations and fomensic recovery may identify the presence of a third party present at the scene.<br />Intelligence tasking may provide further information in terms of motive and involvement of thrid parties.<br />Media release may generate as yet any unidentified witnesses/information
1,20656,4799,20523,See Q 12 - typed in wrong box
1,20657,4801,20524,1. The victim had sustained severe head injuries that suggested that he had been attacked and died as a result of this attack.<br />2. The location of the body is significant and may contain evidence that would establish third party involvement.<br />3. The additional information in terms of the movements of the deceased in the hours before death indicate the potential involvement of others and a potential further crime scene.
1,20658,4805,20522,1) Cubby last seen with victim - This created a dynamic decision to TIE Cubby. He was met by the deceased in the early hours and was rude to the occupant of Violet Way. This led me to immediatley seek to arrest Cubby, in order to preserve evidence such as clothing, cross transference etc. Equally, to increase feeling of safety in the community.<br />2) T/St Kenyon/Matthews/Reynolds - to supprort and corroborate tale. These witnessess may have crucial information as to demeanour and behaviour in time leading up to attack. Equally, they may have taken active part.<br />3) Search strategy - Again, to preserve and retain evidence. Potential weapon not identified, footwear still outstanding, this must be HP action in event of disposal.
1,20659,4800,20524,1. Who the victim is, what is his background and who is associates are. This would be pursued to provide me with a motive.<br />2. The named persons to be statemented and clothing/ eliminations provided. This will enable me to assess where the witnesses had been and also the movements of N1. To establish if there was any conflict/argument/ fight.<br />3. N1 attendance at 46 Violet way and his HA  and my decision to obtain S8 Search warrants for those premises. These may in fact be scenes or certainly may provide me with ionformation/evidence.
1,20660,4804,20524,1. Scene assessment to date and the potential for cross contamination of evidence between nominals - provides the greatest opportunity to obtain tangable evidence which can be used to corroborate / negate witness accounts and allow for scene and incident assessments to be made.<br />2. Witness Kenyon - provides movements of N1 proior to death and details of who N1 has been in contact with. Caveat - maximise opportunities to corroborate his account.<br />3. Initial acounts provided by the witness finding the deceased and the route walked and time lines. Both 2 and 3 contributed to the TIE status of Cubby.
1,20661,4805,20524,Please see Q12.<br />Answer appears at bottom of Q12 and reads 1)2)3)....................sorry!
1,20662,4802,20523,1. Witness account that places Cubby last person with vcitim shortly before victim discovered. This needs to be progressed as a HP to prevent concealment / loss of evidence. SIO has to be mindful that account of kenyon ( which at this time has not been coroborated by CCTV / other wintess) may not be true. What was victim in possesion of when last seen to when found . This may idenify motive robbery / assault/ dispute.<br />Forensic information known to date. key items, weapon (O/S Footwear O/S, fingerprints (unidenfied) other DNA / Fibre opportunities..<br />Witness accounts provides a SOE in the hours prior to victim being found, potential CCTV oppprtuniies, route for witnesses, H to H, scenes where offender may have returned to dsipose of evidence / transfer of forensic evidence, motive.<br />v
1,20663,4803,20524,The Scene - location/proximity to H/A of victim  - This will be the only chance to prove/disprove what happenend. All we can see is the aftermath of a violent event. In order to piece together what has happenend we need to use Science to actually show us and corroborate/disporve verbal/written  accounts from people who may/may not be telling the truth. People can always change their stroy or come up with another account. the Science if correctly and professionally done is extremly difficult to disprove - and must be the key priority<br />witness who sees vicitm go away with an &#039;agitated&#039; Cubby. there is only approx 1 hr 15 minutes after this sighting to when the vicitm was found dead. Cubby at the very least is our best witness - who can tell us what he saw/did with Martin - which we can prove/disprove with CCTV/forensically. He also must not be discounted as a suspect - and hours lost now tracing him may resul;t in loss of forensic evidence - which may asisst him/or the prosecution<br />scene parameters/search - the pathologist has idenfified that a blunt instrument/possibly hammer has been used by the person who murdered martin. It is essential therefore - to try and ensure that if it has been disposed of locally - that as well as the other scenes - a dump site can be identifed for this key piece of evidence. therefore POLSA advice critical    - time also not on our side - Railway line ? etc
1,20664,4799,20524,1. That the location the victim was found was likely to have been the scene of the attack - tis formed the opinion that there were considerable forensic opportunties available. The discovery of the body was time stamped and key witnesses were available at scene. This also enabled early consideration for H2H parameters and CTV assessment - both could potentially identify the movements of any suspect and the victim<br />2. TIE suspect - information became available that the victim had been at an address with others and had left only to return with the suspect - it is clear that he then left with the suspect to diffuse a potential situation. There was a window of approx 1hr and 15mins when the suspect may have been with the victim and killed him. The scene appeared to have considerable blood loss and footprints in blood at th scene.<br />An early arrest and positive action would maximise the opportunties to recovery evidence and minimise loss of evidence<br />3. The information supplied by the witness indicates that the suspect was rude and had left the address to keep the peace - this showed an aggressive mindset and the witnesses could potentially provide key evidence of the attitude of the suspect and can time stamp certain events<br />Created in order, albeit the initial 1 was from 1st feed and actioned prior to 2nd feed - 2 and 3 followed from 2nd feed
1,20665,4799,20525,Although the scenario was anonymised, I ahd prior knowledge of the offence and investigation - albeit on a limited basis. I was aware of the location and key figures. I therefore had to deal with the issues without recourse to this knowledge - DIFFICULT!!!
1,20666,4801,20525,1. Inital assessment<br />2. Crime scene management<br />3. Decisions around the identification of further scenes.
1,20667,4799,20526,See answer for 15 - &#039; a little bit of knowledge......!
1,20668,4805,20525,To be succinct!<br />As the scenario unfolds, the need to document every thought process and strategy within the 5 minute timescale. Also the fear that I am the only one who hasn&#039;t got it right and I should be working in Tesco
1,20669,4801,20526,The balance between treating individuals as witnesses or potential suspects.
1,20670,4804,20525,Providing details of my decisions and actions within the time provided and with limited information and no opportunity to ask questions of those with additional information.
1,20671,4801,20525,This answer should be with Q16
1,20672,4801,20526,This answer should be with Q15
1,20673,4800,20525,Some duplication around the decisions and rationale i ahve expressed in early answers that maybe were required later.<br />The balance between treating the named persons in Feed 2 as witnesses or suspects, although in the light of any information to the contrary, all would be treated as witnesses initially.
1,20674,4799,20526,Also prior training and knowledge of the initia stages of this type of enquiry has helped. The same generic issues arise and have to be considered and included or discounted
1,20675,4802,20525,Paper feed limits flow of information that would be the case in real time MIR. Making decsions without knowledge of background of individuals. Knowledge of key witnesses and make them suspects ie Kenyon. Local knowledge of the key players on this investigation. Limiting number of main strategies. Previous knowledge of incident clouds decision making process.
1,20676,4804,20526,The decision making can only be made on the information provided without the additional complications / factors of resource implications and time pressures etc. etc
1,20677,4803,20525,Assimilating lots of information and making decisions - sometimes without further facts - it is difficult to document and encapsulate your decisions ie frozen in time - but easier to justify in hindsight and write up accordingly<br />Awareness of who you are - how wrong decisions may be viewed - other people may have different views ie arrest cubby asap - scene not managed - why did you make a particular decision at a particular time ? - consequences may be career threatening if conclusion ie conviciton for murder - is unsuccessful due to something you did not see at the time - did not document - but became crucial at a later date
1,20678,4804,20670,Details and rationale had to be short given the time.
1,20679,4800,20526,Assessing the situation in the 1st feed and making/ deciding strategies that would progress the investigation.
1,20680,4802,20525,Previous knowledge of incident. Not being required to manage limited resources as in BCU scenario as this. Not having to justify all decsions. Quite a lot of information provided at the outset, which allows strategies to be set.
1,20681,4803,20526,Basic structure - easy to go into a checklist at a major crime scene ie scene, witnesses, CCTV, suspects  (TDM !! HA)- the hard part is prioritising what you do next and why !
1,20682,4805,20526,To develop the strategies and fast track actions.<br />As the scenario unfolds, the decision to arrest at an early stage, despite the lack of concrete evidence, was an easy one to make. In my experience, it is easier to explain why something was done, rather than not. So in the event that Cubby is not responsible, at worst, he will receive compensation for unlawful detention and I will receive words of advice and my reputation will be in tatters.  At best, we have secured evidence to convict.
1,20683,4803,20527,Make an assumption and not be open minded - ie Cubby didi it. he is the number 1 suspect - so close mind to other leads/avenues - and drive the enquriy towards this - as opposed to a balanced mind - ABC facts - run them past peers and review until conclusion reached
1,20684,4802,20527,Failing to keep options open and focusing in on Cubby, Mmaking decsions on lifestyle of victim and not establsishing potentail motives.
1,20685,4805,20527,Scene management. Not setting adequate parametres. Not securing scene effectively, no loggist!<br />Witnesses being allowed to leave scene.<br />Insufficient information in statements of witnesses, requiring revisits<br />Lack of forensic awareness.
1,20686,4799,20527,Making assumptions - and having a closed mind to other potential scenarios, suspects.<br />Failing to take positive action  - will lead to the loss of key evidence and potentially this loss can never be recovered.<br />Failing to be inclusive to others - dimssing other peoples opinions /ideas
1,20687,4800,20527,Making assumtions as to how the victim came to be in that location with the injuries:<br />Failing to review the scene parameters as information develops;<br />Not requesting FSS to attend scene and provide expert advice and interpretation of scene;<br />Arresting all named persons in feed 2 immediately and obtaining no accounts/no comment IVs.
1,20688,4804,20527,Not ensuring all evidential opportunities are followed and seeking the support and experience of experts available to the SIO, forensic, telecoms, interview co-ord etc. Not having suitable trained and experienced staff to undertake the investigation and enquiries raised.<br />The SIO need to made sure the team is upto the task, but being cognisant of development opportunities for othersd with the right support.
1,20689,4801,20527,1. Making assumptions in terms of the initial assessment. All factors need to be taken into account during this assessment in order to support the<br />2. Treating significant individuals as suspects when there is little or no rationale to support this. This can be caused through pressure from senior command
1,20690,4801,20528,The 24 hour review is probably the most pressing due to the time frame involved. Some enquiries may be in the very early stages and as such it may not be particularly effective, I don&#039;t find either more difficult than the other.
1,20691,4803,20528,24 hour  You are tired - assimilating lots of information - and maybe a little fearful you may have overlooked something or got it wrong. accountability is at it&#039;s highes then - there may be lots of media interest/ ACPO direction/questions - when realistically you probably need some reassurance and guidance. You also have to be open to a critcal review and then flexible to acknowledge any mistakes you have made - learn from them - address them - and move on - without looking too much like an idiot - ie self preservation
1,20692,4805,20528,I wish to point out that I find the review process both helpful and supportive. I feel comfortable with the whole process and am glad of the &#039;extra pair of eyes&#039; in case I miss anything. However in order to answer the question, I would have to say the 24hrs review was the most onerous, only on the basis that I am usually very tired, the investigation is still at full throttle and I could do without having to sit down for another two hours briefing someone else about the job that I have briefed a hundred people beforehand about.
1,20693,4804,20528,I don&#039;t have any difficulty with any of the reviews. I view them as an essential part of the investigative process to provide support at each stage and to ensure that all lines of enquiry have been undertaken. One issue within the review process which always raises comment is other ongoing caseload and resource implications, for the investigation team.
1,20694,4800,20528,24 hour stage as this is very early and the SIO may not have possession of all the facts. You may not know who the victim is, CCtV opportuinities have not been explored or possibley downloaded, witnesses identified, cause of death unknown etc. In addition the SIO could be required to attend at Gold/Media meetings etc.
1,20695,4801,20529,The benefit is that where there is accountability, there is responsibility. As a result there will be a driver to the investigation.<br />In terms of the downside to accountability, I believe that there is a tendancy to use this to apportion blame
1,20696,4799,20528,24 hour review - this is generally held at a time when so much is happening and key lines of enquiry are developing. It is an opportunity to be assessed and reassurred that key lines of enquiry seem to be correct. It is mildly distracting at a busy time but required and necessary<br />The 7 day and 28 day can be delivered in a more structured format. The 7 day review is at a time when more information is available and more meaningful decisions can be reached and assessed. 28 day review is similar
1,20697,4804,20529,I feel the review process provides support to the SIO and in turn provides accountability and transparency should the need arise. The issue with the 24 hour review is arond the SIO having time to sit down with the review officer.
1,20698,4802,20528,All three can be challenging depending upon the investigation. During the early stages of a BCU investigation the SIO is &#039;spinning plates&#039; invariably with miminum staffing levels and having to set, progress and review a number of key strategies. Forensic, scenes, H to H, CCTV, Witesses, Family, Media, Community, suspect / prisoner/ interview, PM and policy all these. A thorough 24 hour review clearly  impacts upon the resilience of the SIO time.<br />Likewise a 7 day review can impact upon SIo time if multiple offenders<br />I support both as they provide support to the SIO and a review porcess at an early stage.<br />28 days review impacts in the requirement to provide all documentaion and responding to questions and interviews from the reviewing team.
1,20699,4803,20529,there is an old saying that in the police you are only one mistake off directing traffic - we do see things with a very critical eye and are quick to make judgments - that&#039;s part of our job<br />Internal criticism OK - with a confidential peer review on your ability methodology etc<br />However - outside criticism from a different department/higher rank who may not know what has actually happenened but has formed an opnion based on selective information - this may harm you professional standing and career impetus/aspirations. It can sometimes be easier to play it safe - not make big decision and hope it doesnt go &#039;tits up&#039; - will it work itself out ? preserve career by maybe waiting to make a decision or blaming someone else
1,20700,4801,20530,I beleive accountability within the police service as a whole is at a reasonable balance. In Merseyside, I would suggest that under a previous regime, there was a tendancy to look towards blame, it is a little early to say whether this will remain the same. I would suggest that where mistakes are made it is much better to use them as learning opportunities as opposed to identifying a scapegoat.
1,20701,4799,20529,Pros - Allows a person to review key decisions and provide an overview.<br />Provides reassurance that decisions are well considered and stand up to scrutiny<br />Allows meaningful dialogue<br />Provides feedback and draws on others experience.<br />Provides transparency<br />Provdes public/organisational reassurance<br />Cons<br />Can&#039;t think of any con&#039;s
1,20702,4805,20529,Pros - Essential. To ensure we retain public confidence in our ability. To retain and share expertise in terms of peer review.  Experiential learning.<br />Cons - Not all those who examine others are credible. Blame culture can be prevelant.
1,20703,4800,20529,The SIO can be blinkered and focused on a line of enquiry and may consider or dismiss other lines. Independent reviews are there to support the SIO and investigation. They provide and independent perspective and fresh pair of eyes and can be supportive in identifying resourcing issues.<br />It also provides transparency and re-assurance to victims families and the community at large that the actions and investigations are continuously reviewed.<br />The negative side of them are that the SIO has to prepare and on some occassions that can occurat a crucial time during the investigation and can detract form the main objective.
1,20704,4803,20530,No - This is a pyramidal system - and you are only as good as your next job. I have rarely found that in the police a view is taken of all your good work over a period of years if you make one big mistake - that is what you are remembered/reknowned for  - again most have knowledge of this and this may mean that caution wins over decisiveness upon occasion.
1,20705,4804,20530,I think the accountability balance has been struck, providing the feedback is delivered and documented in a timely way. The only issue again would be that reviews only take cognisant of the investiation being reviewed and rarely takes into account other caseload and resource/ experience/ training implications, unless specifically mentioned within the SIO&#039;s policy book.
1,20706,4802,20528,Supports the SIO and identifies learning points areas of good practice at an early stage.<br />Ensures victim and family get appropraite service from Merseyside Police. Murder is the most serious ofence and cannot turn clock back, failings will have significant impact upon confidence and satisfaction of public.<br />Required to ensure SIO has the support, which may not be the case with other conflicting BCU priorities.
1,20707,4800,20530,Yes I do.<br />The reveiw process is there to support the SIO and investigation team and to identify issues that may impact on any subsequent prosecution and protect the reputation of the force.
1,20708,4799,20530,Decision making must be transparent, the service are accountable and a demand is needed that there is a process of review and accountablity.<br />The decisons made can be scutinised.<br />Overall, accountability in terms of performance, value for money and decision making are required in all public service environments to ensure constant improvement
1,20709,4805,20530,Yes however, the review process examines the strategies around that particular major incident and fails to take account of other priorites which takes the SIO from leading the enquiry. Inexperienced detectives, lack of staff and continued normal duties are not considered through the accountibility stages. SIO is therefore held accountable without cognisance of outside influences.
1,20710,4802,20530,Accountability is required at all levels, however is good work recognised from this. What recognition is given during these reviews. Too many people from too many areas get involved and intrude unnecessarily, purely so they can answer a question if asked.

Whilst I would be open minded as to how he died, I would treat the incident as murder in terms of my approach to the investigation until I find out exactly what has happened.<br />Clealry the cause of death needs to be established, though initially it seems that the trauma caused by the head injuries seems likely to have caused his detah.<br />I would be ensuring that certain &#039;Fast Track&#039; actions are carried out in a prioritised fashion
1,20750,4811,20749,Excuse the speeling
1,20751,4813,20538,Treat as homicide investigation. Ensure that inital cordons are extended beyond those parameters set by D/Inspector to secure exit and egress from scene of victim and offender. Secure all witnesses and identify as key / significant. decision to be made re video interview etc. Task for H2H and CCTV parameters to be set based on current information. Ambulance to initially be trated as scene. Remove to secure location pending removal of body and examination by CSI. Latter to be coordinated by Crime scene manager.<br />Establish if there is property at the scene which may identify the victim. Contact H.M. Coroner and liaise with Pathologist to determine if they need to attend scene. Secure ambulance staff as witnesses and secure footwear as with witnesses for elimination. Inform ACPO and liaise duty Supt to arrange critical incident meeting.
1,20752,4815,20538,This is the unexplained death of a male who was found laying  on the floor against the alley gates of a pathway loeading between Jubilee Street and Coronation Street, Bootle.<br />The male whose identity at this satge is unknown has obvious head injuries and bloodstained clothing.<br />There are witnesses at scene who at this stage have not been able to provide an account of how the male sustained his injuries.<br />It is my intention to investigate the circumstances surrounding the males death.

1,20754,4812,20539,This is a suspicious death that will require investigation. The scene needs to be preserved further and consideration should immediately be given to cover the body if possible by tent. Also priority to be given to preserve the footprints in blood. Ensure that the scene has been cordoned off to an acceptable. Consider the principles of golden hour evidential yeild. Consideration to be given to the interview of both witnesses. Consideration to obtaing footwear of all persons who have been at scene including the two members of public and the ambulance personnel.

1,20760,4811,20540,Victimology (Include Post Mortem in adition to identification)<br />Witness Search (CCTV/H2H)<br />Intelligence<br />I have ranked the priorities in this order as my first priority is to identify the victim and examine his background as well as finding out the cause of death.<br />I also want to find witnesses to what has taken place and establish what intelligence, including research on recent incidents/calls to police, might point me towards establishing exactly what has happened and if a murder who may be responsible.
1,20761,4812,20540,Forensic strategy applying the principles of the giolden hour for forensic yeild. Would seek assistance from scientific assessment.<br />Witness strategy for persons who were at scene or who may have witnessed this incident.<br />Search strategy to maximise all opportunities for the recovery of evidence within scene perameters.
1,20762,4814,20539,1 Scene/Forensic<br />Secure &amp; preserve evidence. External scene open to elements, time consuming, vital evidence likely to be available requires immediate attentiom. Public thoroughfare having it sealed will cause disruption. The information and evidence recovered may well shape the investigation, especially considerations around potentila dumps site and of course to firmly establish if homicide or not.<br />2.Communty/Witnes<br />To identify and secure key witnesses and secure their evidence as past as is possible in the appropraite format, this will again direct and shape the investiagtion. It will need to be absed on inividual circumstances of witness re significance/trauma and fitness for iv. Also considering the impact on the wider community.<br />3 FLO<br />Clearly dependant on ID victim, which must be a priority to infom the investiagtion and manage the needs and expectations of the family
1,20763,4813,20540,1.Secure scene for forensic examination<br />Victim has been subject of an unknown assault at this stage by unidentified party. It is crucial to secure all available evidence at an early stage in order to a) assits with dentifying victim b) identifying offender c) providing evidence to secure a prosecution and conviction<br />2. Arrange Post Mortem and identify victim:<br />The identity of the victim is essential in order to firstly inform the next of kin as soon as appropriate and secondly gather intelligence of lifestyle, disputes, associates and last known contact / whereabouts.<br />3. Secure CCTV Inital scrutiny within the locality and securing of CCTV may provide crucial evidence linking victim to an offender or providing evidence of a pre cursor incident. CCTV evidence can be quickly lost as such a priority is to secure, prioritise viewing and gather intelligence evidence
1,20764,4815,20538,1) The setting of appropriate scene parameters is important. It will enable the approriatye actions to be generated in respect of search and forensic strategies. It will enable the SIO to make a distinction between attack and deposition sites.<br />2) Forensic Strategy including pathology. This will establish a cause of death and potential sequence of events.<br />There is opportunity for evidential recovery from the deceased in terms of DNA, fibre recovery.<br />The scene is blood stained there is a potential for evidence recovery, eg footwear marks<br />3) Victimology This will give important information regarding lifestyle, antencents friends/ associates. The significance of this line of enquiry is to establish a potential motive for attack and the identity of any persons who may have a motive.<br />It may also provide evidence of why the victim was found in the location.
1,20765,4814,20541,Yes<br />Scene examination and search will require to take cognisance of PM findings to include any CCTV etc<br />Media&amp;FlO startegies updated with new information. Victim ID. Hold back information from media to support the investigation<br />Victims shoes being removed is a peculiar feature and will need consideration and forensic examination.<br />Consider search of victime HA<br />Key priority now though will shift to the sequence described by Kenyon. Search at the HA to be conducted.<br />4 individuals are now of significane all to be fuly researched<br />Kenyon/Matthews/Reynolds urgent interviews.<br />Cubby TIE/Suspect status dependant on intel and developments may well lead to early decision to arrest to secure/preserve evidence
1,20766,4812,20541,Cubby on the face of the information available may now be strong suspect or a significant witness. Martin, Matthews, and Reynolds may be significant witnesses and in possession of vital information that may hold the motive for this killing. My priorities now would be to make Cubby subject of TIE status because at this point he is the last person with the victim a short period before the murder., and at this stage of the investigation treat Matthews, Reynolds, and Kenyon as significant witnesses.
1,20767,4814,20541,Cubby of course could be a significant witness ar even injured himself due to tight time parameters between last sighting and discovery
1,20768,4811,20540,Yes<br />My priority now is to trace and interview all key and significant wittnesses, in particular Cubby who on current information, was the last person to see the deceased alive and may be either suspect or key wittness. He was seen with the deceased just over one hour before the deceased was found.<br />In addition now that the victim has been identified and cause of death established I would move forensic strategy up the list of priorities. Fingerprints and footwear in blood would form part of fast track forensic actions to identify.<br />Scene identification and management would also be a forensic priority. We have the scene of were he was found, but potentially other scenes (Home Address/Violet Way etc)<br />My priotiy strategies would now therefore be:<br />Wittnesses (Include trace and interview Cubby)<br />Forensic<br />Intelligence
1,20769,4815,20541,1) The priority would still be to establish appropriate scene parameters. I would consider extending the scene to include 46 Violet Way. This decision is based on the disclosures by Timmy Kenyon regardoing the victims attendance at the house earlier in the day.<br />2) Forensic strategy remains a key line of enquiry. There is significant blood staining and there remains the potential for forensic opportunities which may assist in identifyoing those responsible.<br />3) Victimology would remain a priority as it may provide important information regarding the lifestyle of the deceased. A HP action withion this strategy would be to formally identify the victim.
1,20770,4813,20541,Priorities have been reviewed and initial priorities remain in place however the following has superceeded them:<br />1. Treat Timmy Kenyon as Key witness and develop strategy for his management<br />2. Treat Sharon Matthews and Debra Reynolds as key witnesses and develop witness strategy<br />3. Attend home address of Kenyon and consider that this may have been scene for earlier evidence - appropriate briefing to staff.<br />4. Identify FLO , Brief and seek to identify NoK to arrange for family to be informed<br />5. Securing of evidence in relation to footwear for all witnesses, including professional witnesses for elimination<br />6. Fastrack fingerprint mark in order to identify if victims or third party especially suspect<br />7. Consider raising Cubby to TIE in order to secure evidence as information suggest he may have been the person to be with the victim prior to the murder<br />8. Fully research Cubby<br />9. Obtain warrant with a view to securing potential home address of victim which maybe a further crime scene
1,20771,4813,20542,HP Actions<br />1. Liaise crime scene manager to ensure forensic recovery. Consider use of Forensic scientist to give opinion on blood distribution and as to whether scene between alleyway ia an attack site or dump site<br />2. Trace and interview following key witnesses<br />Wiiliam Jones<br />Gillian Smith<br />Stephen Jenkins<br />Timmy Kenyon<br />Sharon Matthews<br />Debra Reynolds<br />3. research Stephen Jenkins who was initially found with the victim<br />4. Confirm identity of victim through FLO<br />5. Secure 36 jubilee Street as potential scene<br />6. research Joey Cubby<br />7. Fast track fingerprint mark in blood<br />8. Fast track footwear mark in blood<br />9. Secure CCTV in vicinity of scene<br />10. Secure CCTV in vicinity of 46 Violet way Bootle<br />11. Consider raising Cubby to TIE

1,20776,4811,20542,My decision making and rationalle is based upon the need to quickly establish a sequence of events leading up to the death of the victim and to identify the offender.<br />We now have key wittnesses that it is a priority to interview to confirm or deny the account given by Kenyon.<br />I would expect tracing and interviewing to include intelligence profiles so as to help with the establishment of a motive if possible. The deceased is a drug dealer so obtaining full details on his background may reveal recent disputes with other dealers.
1,20777,4813,20543,The interviewing of key witnessesin 46 Violet Way may provide crucial evidence regarding the last movements of the deceased and place him in the company of a person namley Cubby who may either be a further witness or potentially a suspect.<br />The identification of the victim is necessary to notify NOK and gather information from the victims family and associates of his last movements, contact with persons, mobile telehone, use of vehicles etc<br />The fastracking of the forensic recovery may identify a potential suspect or further witnesses. The fingerprint and footwear mark in particular are crucial to placing a party at the scene after the assault<br />The securing of CCTV evidence may provide crucial evidence of the movements of the deceased and place the victim with an offender or offenders. Equally it may provide intelligence which may assist with eliminating persons from the investigation
1,20778,4811,20543,Sorry, I seem to have answered 13 in the 12 box somehow
1,20779,4815,20541,The decisions are based on the information to date.<br />The deceased has been subject to a violent attack there is a potential for  blood/ fibre transfer and footwear impressionsfrom the body and any potential blood stains at the scene. A number of people have been in the company of the deceased in the hours leading upto the murder and the seizing of clothing may be required for comparison/ elimination.<br />The murder weapon has not yet been recovered and may have been disposed of locally<br />The witnesses at Violet Way may be able to provide a sequence of events for the hours leading upto the murder regarding his movements and any significant events.<br />The scene at Violet Way is the last known sighting of the deceased there appears to have been an altercation and one cannot discount the possibility at this stage that this may have been an attack site.<br />CCTV and H/H may provide new information to take the enquiry forward.
1,20780,4815,20543,As above
1,20781,4815,20543,1) Potential for forensic recovery, which may assist in identifyoing a sequence of events and identity of the attacker<br />2)Last known  sighting at Violet Street, which may identify potential scene or witnesses<br />3) Identity of the victim, which supports victimology enquiries.
1,20782,4814,20544,Cause of death<br />Confirms homicide. Nature of injuries and likely means of infliction leading to possible forensic opportunities.<br />Poss SOE<br />Account of Kenyon gives possible SOE this identifies poss wits/suspects. Gives a critical line of enq to be pursued urgently to secure and preserve evidence.<br />Forensic opportunities<br />The scene recoveries and interpretation will identify opportunities and tactics to link potential wits/offenders to victim and or scene
1,20783,4811,20544,The fact that the deceased laft 46 Violet Way with CUBBY<br />The fingerprints and footprints in blood<br />Thefact that the likely weapon used is a hammer<br />I rank them in this order as it is priority to interview the person last seeing the deceased alive and at this time we believe that person to be CUBBY. He can at the least fill in more of the time line and may be a suspect.<br />Clealry the fingerprints and footprints in blood may point to a suspect as they have been caused some time after the deceased was attacked or during the attack.<br />The deceased was not only apparently stamped upon but a weapon was used. I want to find this weapon for foresnic examination and to help identify its owner.
1,20784,4813,20543,1. Identity of the Victim<br />This impacts on the thrust of the investigation, media attention, the need to notify and gether information from the victims family<br />2. Information regarding the last known movements of the victi, namely that just over an hour before his death he had been seen by witnesses who can describe his demeanour his, his intentions after leaving the bottle address and in relation to suspect identification, who he was last seen in company with<br />3. Forensic recovery at the scene<br />This may provide early idenitfication of  suspect(s) This could result of securing of further evidence which may implicate or eliminate each party
1,20785,4812,20542,To TIE Cubby because in the absence of other information he is the current suspect in this enquiry and he needs to be traced and arrested asap in oprder to preserve evidence.<br />To fast track forensic submissions to acquire any independent forensic evidence that may implicate Cubby.<br />To fully trace and interview witnesses who were present in Violet Way to establish any potential motive or other information of benefit to the enquiry.
1,20786,4813,20544,Refer to last three points on answer to point 13
1,20787,4815,20545,Setting out and questioning your rationale for your decision making in a sterile environment as opposed to a dynamic situation.
1,20788,4815,20545,The listing of the HP actions
1,20789,4811,20545,It is slightly unrealistic as all paper feeds are.<br />Interpeting the fact that the shoes of the deceased had been removed.
1,20790,4811,20545,It is also always difficult to draw out priorities from the information though experience helps.
1,20791,4815,20545,Please ignore last comment, which should relate to Q16
1,20792,4814,20545,It is sometimes difficult to breakdown and prioritise decision making processes. A lot of what is done is a process to be worked through and at an early stage it is difficult to say one takes priority over any other. Clearly there are some fast tracl action lines of enquiry but they will all need doing as their relevance and importance can increase/decrease quickly dependant on developments elsewhere. Rationale sometimes appears repetetive but these are initial consideartions that will of course develop with the investiagtion as it develops, these cases are by definition dynamic.
1,20793,4812,20545,Lack of information regarding certain aspects of the circumstances surrounding the daeth. Not being able to attend at the scene. Not being able to sopeak to scientific expert regarding scene and  post mortem advice.  Not being able to seek the advice of crime scene manager.Not being able to make other decisions due to the absence of intelligence on the persons who are named in the task.
1,20794,4815,20546,The listing of HP actions, following a menu of options available to you
1,20795,4813,20545,Normally the process adopted in an investigation is very dynamic and as such is in the first instance very task orientated but against a backdrop of a strategy. The process of reviewing priorities almost becomes second nature (unless resources dictate otherwise) Identifying Top three priorites is not something one would consciously consider but rather one would seek to idenify all the priorities but task out the most important first.
1,20796,4814,20546,Relativley straight forward to explain the general apprach to the securing and preserving of evidence to support and shape the investigation.
1,20797,4811,20546,Approaching the identification of priorities in a systematic way.<br />At least we have some wittnesses to go on fairly early !!
1,20798,4813,20546,Assessing from the information the tasks and actions to be considered following the initial assessment it is to be treated as a homicide
1,20799,4812,20546,Knowing what to do in any given situation where a body has been found and ensuring the principles of the golden hour are adhered to. This was easy to apply to this task
1,20800,4814,20547,Jumping to conclusions to soon, but balalnced against the need to take early decisive action.<br />Scene management is a once only opportunity, care, time and appropriate resources required<br />Avoid assumptions
1,20801,4811,20547,To jump to the conclusion that CUBBY is a suspect too soon. Though he is clearly a key individual, to identify him as a suspect may lead to you placing too much emphasis upon him and not enough objectivity in your decision making processes.<br />He may be a witness. Best to treat him as such until you know or strongly suspect otherwise
1,20802,4813,20547,Making assumptions. In particular in relation to work that has been tasked out. Namley has it actually been prioritised in accordance with a given direction and that it is actually being progressed.
1,20803,4815,20547,The most probable mistake is to devlop a hypothesis at an early stage based on assumptions rather than facts., which could set the enquiry off in the wrong direction
1,20804,4812,20547,From experience it is always vital that the services of experts are called upon to assist the investigation at an early stage. However the service of an expert in whatever field of expertise can be called upon at any stage of the investigation. The mistake that can be made is not to call on the services of an expert due to cost.
1,20805,4814,20548,Each provides challenges, never pleasant as there is always a fear that significant failings may be found which woukd reflect badly on the SIO. The initial reveiews can take significant SIO time out of the investigaton at crucial early stages. Must be balanced and supoortive especially early review.
1,20806,4811,20548,I find the 24 hour review most difficult purely due to the fact that in my experience it gets in the way as it is a little too soon. I feel that 48 or better still 72 hours is more appropriate and in practice it often takes place at this stage. I accept that the first 24 hours is the most important time in any investigation, but the SIO does not operate in a silo and should be using joint decision making with his/her management team as an accountability balance anyway.
1,20807,4812,20548,Personally ther most difficult period of reviewing murder investigations is at 28 day period. The reasons for this are many. Some of the common themes are loss of evidence, having to re interview potential key witnesses who are not willing to assist the police after the absence of 28 days. In most cases all lines of enquiry have been followed up and it is difficult to identify productive new lines of enquiry that have not been identified during previous 28 day period.
1,20808,4815,20548,The 28 days review is probably the most difficult.<br />This review process is  very subjective and can sometimes lead to differing of opinions.  Because of the subjectivity it is not always seen as a suppportive process.
1,20809,4811,20549,The pros are that it keeps the police service in check. We have some pretty strong powers that we can bring to bear on the community and accountability is there to stop us abusing that authority.<br />I can&#039;t think of any cons, other than the politicisation of the police should that accountability be linked to elected representatives.
1,20810,4814,20549,Police service must be accountable as we police by consent &amp; trust. Danger of the system being weighted to heavily in favour of defendant. It can create a culture of being risk averse as mistakes are not permited when we are judged in hindsight for dynamic decision making in very testing circumstances. Hours of investigation and consideration can be given to a decision that was made immediatley.
1,20811,4813,20548,I would suggest that 28 day  review is probably slightly more difficuly  than the earlier reviews. Although sometimes 24 hours and 7 day reviews can been an inconvenience only because of the demands placed upon your time.<br />Regarding the 28 day review, I suspect and certainly  from my own perspective, one would always want to have secured sufficient evidence and intelligence in order that an offender would have been identified, arrested and charged, but only  with sufficient evidence to secure a sucessful prosecution at the earliest opportunity. If the 28 day stage had been reached that could suggest that it may be a protracted enquiry. The review process itself however should be there to support the investigation and provide consideration to issues that due to the dynamic nature of investigatuions may have been overlooked or not fully considered
1,20812,4811,20551,The tri-partite accountability balance is often &#039;skewed&#039; by political influences such as government drive for accountability through performance targets etc. In my experience the operational autonomy of Chief Officers has been eroded over the past 20 years through the &#039;drip drip; effect of Home Office central influence.
1,20813,4812,20549,From an SIO perspective, it is important to demonstrate to either a senior officer or to a judicial panel that you as an SIO are accountable to the public, your organisation, the victim&#039;s family and that you can at any time demonstrate by means of continous recording of your actions the reasons for your actions in whatever action you have taken.
1,20814,4815,20549,The Police service should always be accountable. From a SIO perspective it is interesting that decsions made today can have ramifications may years down the line, particularly in respect of ECHR
1,20815,4811,20551,It seems to me that there is a fine line between appropraite accountability with operational autonomy and directive central influence. In my view this line is too often crossed in recent years.
1,20816,4814,20551,There is a real danger with the 24 hour media world that someone always has to be found to blame. The police do seem to be disproportianatley held to account and blame for societies ills. In fairness this culture extends beyond the police service to others such as social work &amp; probation.<br />Hindsight is a wonderful thing!!
1,20817,4813,20549,It is crucial that the service is accountable on a number of fronts<br />1. it maintains high standards and ensures that there is a system whereby we can measure our own performance against for example public expectations<br />2. It allows for open and auditable reviews from which we can learn and impliment best practise<br />3. It ensures that the public can have confidence in the nature of police work and that even if mistakes are made that they are not endemic within the organisation and that the focus of policing is to provide an effective and professional service
1,20818,4815,20551,Recent events have brought into sharp focus our levels of accountability. Our actions are, rightly, subject to scrutiny,, what is evident in recent times, is that people are being held to account in the glare of the media, without it seems the due processes being followed.<br />I think most people agree that we should be held to account, however this should be done in context.
1,20819,4812,20551,At a more senior level yes, but I do not think that the balance is right yet amongst some officers within the police force. I base this comment on issues such as complaints against police which are currently continuing to rise and probably in most cases arise from a minority of police officers who behave in an unprofessional manner against members of the public due to the fact that they beleive that they are accountable to no one. Once this is eradicated, I beleive the balance of accountability will have been achieved.
1,20820,4813,20551,It is necessary for there to be an internal review and accountability process. In serious investigations this comes through the gold chain of Command. This process should also provide support and consider any wider stratefgic implications to the force and the community. It must however run alongside the investigation and not detract from it

1,21149,4879,21127,this is the future
1,21150,4891,21128,confident
1,21151,4889,21140,I don&#039;t think that I can talk about it openly!
1,21152,4877,21113,Not knowing who my staff were until late on in the day. It meant that although I was well briefed I couldn&#039;t get to speak with them and do any form of pre-brief. With the conference being so important it would have been helpful for me to know / have an idea of teh abilities of the staff I would be working with and know what risk areas there were.
1,21153,4883,21113,1. The main difficulty was the delay in receiving funding agreement which delayed much of the planning.<br />2. An element of too many cooks.....there were a number of people at Ch Supt level involved in strategivc decision making.
1,21154,4877,21113,The second issue was beyond the control of the planning process in that I was on leave and courses prior to the final week of the planning so it meant I was behind on the meetings and had a lot of cathcing up to do - this wouldn&#039;t be an issue at future conferences.
1,21155,4880,21113,The uncertainty of the financial reimbursement meant that staffing could not be finalised with any degree of certainty until very late stages. This caused frustration amongst area resource teams and friction with the staff associations as large numbers of rest days had been cancelled.<br />The second issue was a lack of clarity over deployment and availability of resources. This was caused by having multiple silvers, who although well intentioned, were making decisions in effective isolation,
1,21156,4884,21113,1) Command structure caused some confusion pre-event. Additional meetings that excluded key people and this caused unecessary difficulties.<br />Not convinced by the need to have a PSU Silver<br />2) Planning team resilience and experience. The team worked very hard and against a demanding schedule but progress of the Silver plan was left unchecked and this causeda vulnerability late on.
1,21157,4889,21113,The available resources (from Government) meant that the conference had to be policed on the basis of informed risk analysis rather than as a totally secure site.<br />The above meant that certain forseeable threats e.g. bogus bomb call into hotel, could not be safely discounted without the potential need for an evacuation.
1,21158,4886,21113,Timescale for planning - The inability of the Home Office to make a decision re funding which had a knock on effect in terms of our ability to complete the plans in time. In addition, the Lib Dems had not previously been involved in such a high profile policing event and they were initially a bit reticent<br />There was no footprint / template as the Force had not policed a Party Conferecne previously and this meant the plan had to be formulated from &#039;scratch&#039;
1,21159,4887,21113,1) limited timescales caused by the creation of the coalition government in May. This led to a three month planning window, in comparison most forces have twelve months to plan for political conferences.<br />2) the decision by the Home Office to limit the budget for this conference compared to other political conference policing operations during the same period, This led to limited the funding for several integral components of the plan was not agreed until one week before the operation.
1,21160,4888,21113,1. The team who predominatly had no previous relevant experience were brought together at relatively short notice, which had a big impact on the pre event planning. The team was too small given only 3 months to prepare and plan and deliver the operation. A minimum of 6 months is required.<br />2. Decision making by Gold / Silver in respect of resourcing requirements was too slow,  there were too many amendments to the policing model and the final decision took too long to come.
1,21161,4879,21113,Where to start?...<br />There were lots of issues (listed below) the big ones in summary being<br />1. Lack of experience - us and key stakeholders<br />2. Lack of clarity re funding and therefore resources<br />Contributing to both were:<br />That we&#039;d never planned a policing a conference before<br />that the lib dems had never had security before<br />That there was national review of the policing of party conferences ongoing but with nothing written down<br />that the HO were intent on saving money without actually addressing the issues of consistency and risk in any meaningful way<br />that we had tight time limits<br />that the key players were mostly in london and &#039;too busy&#039; to visit liverpool<br />the number of stakeholders that needed managing local and national<br />lack of certainty re finance<br />need for big decisions on issues such as kitting out a control room in Mather Ave which had to be made but without the information and money needed to make them sensibly
1,21162,4880,21114,Ideally, we would have clarity over funding at an early stage. However, even if we dont we could split the operation into &#039;what will be doing even if we dont get funding&#039; and &#039;what is funding dependant&#039;. Planners could then get on with planning the former section and just leave the unknowns until later.<br />A single silver commander should be identified to answer to Gold as per Aintree planning. Other senior officers in Silver roles would be known as Key Task Commanders or another catchy imaginative title.
1,21163,4891,21113,Resourcing decisions being changed often. This caused lots of unnecessary work for many people and delayed planning. The short amount of time available to plan the operation also caused difficulties when combined with the chopping and changing when making decisions
1,21164,4888,21114,A bigger team needs to be created to reduce the workload and stress involved. Also to spread the workload during the actual event.<br />6 months should be the absolute minimum required to plan and deliver future operations of this kind.
1,21165,4884,21113,Single Event Silver<br />The silver plan could be moved to Force operations. The Conference team could operate in much the same way but with the knowledeg that the Silver plan was being completed by experienced planners with a perspective on Force commitments. This is not to say that those responsible did a poor job; excellent effort in deifficult circumstances. However, Force Ops is there for a reason and it wopuld be one less pressure for the Conferenec team. This would alos support a more coordinated approach across the command structure.
1,21166,4886,21113,Try and identify a Single point of Contact for the Home Office and obtain an early decision re funding i.e. at least nine months prior. Make early contact with the Labour Party re their aspirations for the Conference<br />The Force now has experience of policing a Party Conference and it is important that the Force utilises the skills and experience acquired for the next Conference. Having said that it is also important that the Force realises that the next Conference will be different from the Lib Dems and the plans should be be-spoke and not just a &#039;cut and pste&#039; of the last plans
1,21167,4891,21114,I would hope that we would be allowed more time to plan the event. I think that decisons need to be made early on around resourcing.
1,21168,4889,21114,The likelihood is that funding will continue to be an issue but it is important to argue cogently for at least sufficient funding to minimise the risk to the greatest extent possible.<br />Whilst the above clearly turns on an assessment of risk, it is however the case that unless certain parts of the operation are absolutely secure, then we will remain  vulnerable to disruption. Whilst this was the case for the conference venue, my opinion is that the principle hotel should have been more secure.
1,21169,4884,21113,As above. Answer 1b refers to Silver plan completion; 1a is the single Silver
1,21170,4877,21113,In regards to issue one the problem arises because BCUs cannot always submit resource details to an event other than to say that they will provide an inspector or 4 sergeants for example. They may have a problem themselves identifying exactly who that is until late on. One preference I would have is for the same staff to be nominated for all of the days from across the force. Advance planning (ie knowing that in 12 months time we have a Labour conference) we should be able to determine what staff are currently showing as being on duty now and with the relevant occupational qualifications - ie APOC /IPOC / bronze commander / Tac Ad. The force suffers at present because so many people are occupationally competent but operationally competent. Using the officers with trained skills more often and as part of a dedicated Cadre would prove more effective. Senior leaders would then feel more confident that the staff appointed to the event are capable of doing the role without recourse to have death by meetings to ensure work is being done.
1,21171,4888,21114,One Silver Commander for the event and quicker decisions.
1,21172,4887,21114,I think the limited timescale was as a result of the General Election results and is unlikely to occur before the next event, however there is a need to establish a planning process early to influence and agree the security operation, I think we may cause the same situation again if we do not allocate sufficient resources for the next planning process.<br />We should enter into early discussion with the home office and agree the outline proposals for the policing operation  as early in the process as possible, if the budget is limited then we will be able to effectively plan for it without the disruption of changes to the funding late in the process.
1,21173,4882,21114,this was made difficult as the steer was changed and additional work was added but this became a fending off process.<br />Partners were not as helpful as had been anticipated and maybe the political nature of the event had a bearing on this.<br />There were lots of other elements of the plan which directly affected the planning and there were a couple of departments who saw this and we were able to help however this was not across the board and the nearer the event got the more difficult it became.<br />The fact that the site was on private land caused a mulitude of problems and the joined up thinking was challenging as each had thier own agenda/issues which to them were the most important.<br />very late on the requirement for a stand down plan was considered and that took a considerable amount of work which then appeared to be over scrutinised and still caused issues because as soon as the event is over everyone wants to go home asap. Too many what ifs and an unclear idea of what each role/department can bring this resulted in planning which was not needed.
1,21174,4879,21113,1. is quite easy as we now have some good experience, which we should utilise by ensuring some continuity in key roles. The other key stakeholders (particularly Labour Party, Security Company) have experience. In fact this may become the next problem as their expectations may well be unrealistic given HO desire to cut costs, apparently in line with what we did this year.<br />2. We have to work from now to pin down the HO re funding for next year and work with other conference forces and ACPO to try and get an early and consistent approach
1,21175,4883,21114,1.  Whilst there will be a longer lead in period we should plan a number of scenarios so that we can adapt depending on funding levels.<br />2. One event Silver to be engaged in the planning working closely with the event coordinator and a stronger link to Force Ops through the Gold staff officer.
1,21176,4884,21115,Coordinator role was effective. The &#039;fixer&#039; role was a real bonus.<br />Professionalism of staff on the ground supported by the Gold Commander&#039;s cognisance of officer welfare.
1,21177,4889,21115,The visibility of staff on the ground was good and the best was clearly made of the overall funding obtained.<br />Staff appeared well motivated, cheerful and professional - dispositions that undoubtedly owe much to the excellent provision of quality hot meals and a good rotational system of breaks.
1,21178,4877,21115,Advance briefings and the quality of the briefing packs - these proved essential to me as I knew the venue layout prior to getting to the site on the days, I had been able to put in place contingencies in regards to positioning of officers on static points (media area) that was now occupying some of the static points. The briefings were done on a one to one or group basis and were extremely informative. The packs for supervisors were relevant and contined useful map information and security information.
1,21179,4880,21115,The willingness of officers do do a good job and be flexible whilst often working in challenging conditions over long hours. Similarly the professional manner in which supervisors conducted themselves, maintaining standards throughout.<br />The command structure, although criticised by some, worked very well. Issues were dealt with quickly and competently throughout with sufficient resilience. The various command roles fitted together well, which suggests that the model was the right one and only the tiltles need to be changed to please the purists!
1,21180,4883,21115,1. The relationships developed between the policing team and the partners involved undoubtably contributed to the success.<br />2. The public order issues were well thought through and well planned there was a clear idea structure and plan and sufficient resources.
1,21181,4891,21115,The logistics side of the event was succesful. I think this was due to the sheer hard work and commitment of the team. Everybody pulled together and took responsibilty for making sure it was successful. The briefings were particularly successful recieving very good feedback from officers. I think this was down to the how the briefing officer had designed the briefing package
1,21182,4882,21114,Earlier involvment and maybe a dedicated role position in the team which would allow better understanding of many of the issues.<br />A clear steer and focus on roles and responsibilities. A willingness to listen and not take the stance of this is going to happen and you need to do that in the best and easiest way<br />Stand down plan needs to be in focus from the off.
1,21183,4888,21115,1. The planning team given its size, the time constraints and budgetary constraints did a fantastic job pulling in pulling things together.<br />2. The Force was self sufficient in terms of resources and catering (however please note that if future operations were any bigger then the Force would struggle and may have to rely on mutual aid)
1,21184,4879,21115,1. The policing tone/style of policing worked really well - professional, alert, friendly, positive. I put this down to really effective briefing before and during the event and the leaders used on the operation from sgt up.<br />2. Command structure - despite all the angst re this beforehand, my view is that the structure was effective and the skills and personalities of those involved also produced sound decision making, good communication and a generally entertaining working environment!
1,21185,4886,21115,The whole event went well primarily because the planning team invested a lot of time with the landowners, businesses, ACCL and the Lib Dem Party prior to and during the Conference to ensure that they where fully informed regarding the security operation<br />Similarly effective briefings had a significant impact upon the deployed officers - particularly regarding the requirement for a friendly demeanour. This (i,e the friendliness of the officers) received favourable feedback from delgeates
1,21186,4885,21113,1. My element of the plan was in relation to issues that could arise.  It was necessary therefore to produce a comprehensive plan to deal with every possible contingency arising from an anticipated event.  In effect this was virtual planning but, which then required scrutiny because of the requisite authorities required.<br />2. The nature of the event necessitated the deployment of firearms officers, which previously would have been overt and clearly visible.  Owing to the wishes of the party there was a requirement for the deployment to be covert, whcih presented challenges in terms of training, role expectation and equipment.  Firearms officers are used to being overt by the very nature of their routine deployments and so this change had to be managed effectively.<br />In relation to 1. I am satisfied that the footprint created by the plan created for this event will form an effective foundation for the future.<br />In relation to 2. Surveillance awareness training for firearms officers is scheduled to address issues of interoperability with other forces. This will assist with this kind of deployment.<br />2a) (i) The decision to separate the firearm command roles was correct and allowed the respective commanders to concentrate on the relevant working strategies for the event.<br />(ii) It is my personal view that the rigour and scrutiny throughout the planning process ensured that each element was contiguous to the overall aims set by the party and the organisation.  It also ensured for a smooth and integrated command structure that worked well throughout the conference.
1,21187,4887,21115,The creation of a dedicated planning team that included the security coordinator and specialist planners, this ensured that tactical decisions were discussed between the specialist planners and joint decisions were made quickly and effectively. The communication between the police and the partner agencies was a strong aspect of the planning and created a team approach, regular communication with all of the agencies was effective and led to a smooth operation.
1,21188,4877,21115,The hotel liasion officers provided an invaluable informal contact with delegates and helped promote the &#039;Just Talk&#039; agenda - the success of the operation was summed up by considerable numbers of the public approaching officers with kind comments about the style of policing adopted. They considered that even during teh evening when some of the behaviour was boisterous due to alcohol that the hotel liaison were policing the environment with a strong awareness of the nature of the environment around them - comments such as &quot;visible but not oppressive&quot; were often attributed to the staff.
1,21189,4883,21116,1. we need to be very clear about command structure right from the outset.  This will give the planning team better clarity and assist the whole planning process.<br />2. The intelligence flows were appaling and this will need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  This will enable us to better plan resources and in particular not have the same level of resources on duty every day without the intelligence to support it.
1,21190,4879,21116,1. closer enbedding of the prot operation into the overall aims of the operation. This would have prevented potential for breach of the security operation by the prot team and smoothed communications between the two. Ensuring prot officers and commanders attended the wider briefing would have assisted this, if feasible<br />2. A more focussed and dynamic intelligence operation in the run up to and during the conference. It did not always seem that they were structuring or sharing all intel available or understood the practical operational intelligence requirements.
1,21191,4877,21116,Officers on the static points were risk assessed for the whole event as requiring body armour. For many this meant long hours either stood still or walking with full kit for protracted periods. On reflection a more dynamic risk assessment process in respect of the body armour threat could have been carried out daily. Whilst the threat of terrorist attack cannot be planned out completely in respect of these events the overall threat level was low. In any other form of policing a low threat level would not necessitate the need for body armour.
1,21192,4891,21116,The silver control suite was unsuitable, many people were seated down the corridor in a different room.
1,21193,4882,21115,Links with certain departments and staff who understood the benefits and relationships.<br />food maybe too much!<br />Having departmental links in Silver and on the ground who knew the plan and its objectives.<br />In the end the willingness to accept little disruption to the road network.<br />Performance indicators from the troops.<br />Although late consultation with outside agencies and the high level of co-operation.<br />Management around the search site which if looked at in isolation could have been the biggest headache but was possibly the best part.<br />In general the minimum disruption to the travelling public around the whole site and city.
1,21194,4884,21116,Clarity on a Command Structure that complies with national guidelines. This removes personality issues and unecessary problems/obstacles from the pre event phase. This would also be crucial if the Conference encountered demanding public order problems where the command would be severely tesetd.<br />The relationship between the Planning team and Force Ops. This needs to be &#039;joined up&#039; to ensure that the organisation makes use of the resources, expereince whilst taking cognisance of the wider demand faced by the Force during the future Conferences. This would take the pressure off the Conference team and reomve unecessary problems.
1,21195,4886,21116,Accreditation. I believe a reliance on Greater Manchester Police to carry out the accreditation on our behalf left Merseyside Police vulnerable (e.g. the imposition of unrealistic timescales for the completion of accreditation). This timescale brought us into conflict with ACCL<br />There needs to be corporate support for the Gold Commander from across all portfolios.There was very limited planning experience within the planning team, as there was a reluctance across the Force to provide experienced persons for the planning team (PolSA, Silver Plan Writer, Intelligence Officers etc...... )As a result undue pressure was placed upon those individuals within the planning team who did have experience
1,21196,4889,21116,As above, I consider that, if resources allow, the principle hotel, should be secured to the same standard as the conference venue.<br />The Fireams Personal Protection Team ended up working between 16 - 18 hours per day. Whilst unavoidable, initial planning did not anticipate this factor and no accomodation was arranged for the officers involved. Same was resolved during the conference but one to be borne in mind for the next event. Suggest that rooms should be sourced within the principle hotel to maximise the available rest period for these officers given the obvious risks re extended tours whilst carrying firearms.
1,21197,4888,21115,1. The same resources (as far as practicable) need to be used each day to reduce the delay between briefings and actual deployment on the ground to the event. This requires each BCU resource manager agreeing to resource the event in the same way.<br />2.  The use of HQ for everything e.g Silver, briefings, parking, catering which placed a strain on normal business and in the event of loss of business continuity at HQ there were no real fall backs.
1,21198,4885,21113,2b) (i).  The shift change overs need to be better co-ordinated.  There was at relevant times of the day a mass movement of yellow jacketed officers across a main dual carriage way.  This could have presented the wrong impression for members of the public in terms of overall numbers of officers and the potential knock on effect for them in terms of the policing of local communities.<br />(ii)  I am not convinced that there was a comprehensive and appropriate investigative strategy for this event.  This again would have been a contingency but one that could have been implemented in the case of a serious event.
1,21199,4880,21115,The changing of staff on a sometimes daily basis caused issues with briefing, This must be balanced against welfare issues over long hours but some more structure should have been brought to this. Perhaps planning team could have stipulated which Blocks attended from Areas?<br />Resources seemed top heavy overall and we need to take a more risk based approach, particularly with firearms, public order, RVSS teams, Gold Reserve.
1,21200,4887,21116,The Command structure was effective during the operation because command protocols were clearly established, however during the planning process the numerous Silver Commanders made decisions which impacted other aspects of the operation, I would suggest  a single Silver Commander with responsibility for the operation during the planning phase would have negated the problem.<br />There should be increased resillience for the Silver planning role, the lead into conference is during the recognised A/L period which led to significant difficulties for the entire team
1,21201,4877,21116,The changeover process coudl have been easier between sections going off after 12 hours and those coming on. Some staff were arriving on the evening not having been given a static posting and expecting that the sergeants on the ground allocated them on arrival. This was not an issue when the same staff from a BCU were used each day as it became part of the pre-brief before arriving on site. This slicker approach would have helped reduce overtime costs.<br />CBRN officers were deployed into what would be the &#039;hot zone&#039; (static posts 19-31) . Shoudl it have been deternmined that a CBRN capability was required it would have been better to have these officers merely at nominate stage within a BCU each day and not part of the overall static points. Had an incident occurred logistical issues would have occurred as the chances are most would likely to be taken out by the contaminating effects of the attack.
1,21202,4886,21166,This should have been an answer for 1b
1,21203,4888,21197,3. PLEASE NOTE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN RESPONSE TO 2b
1,21204,4882,21116,Earlier involvment to avoid late plans and mild panic.<br />better and earlier involvment with planning barrier contractor.<br />Little understanding of the impact and disruption.<br />Stand down plan needs to be better planned and earlier.
1,21205,4877,21117,The CBRN contingent was deployed to static points in the arena security. This was impractical based on the likely 100m contamination area that was in place (see answers 2b). The CBRN staff should not have been nominated to do static points and shoudl have been retained in BCUs until required. They could still work 12 hour shifts but would not have been needed to operate barriers.
1,21206,4884,21116,Command Structure - PSU Silver<br />This does not comply with national guidelines and it would almost certainly be questioned had something wrong.<br />That said, the Gold Commander completed comprehensive policy notes outlining her rationale and was able to clearly articualte her thoughts at the adversarial briefing.
1,21207,4883,21116,1. There would be concern at the number of silver commanders and the roles each of them were playing in the command structure which could potentially have led to confusion and a lack of understanding around who was responsible for what aspects of the operation.<br />2. There were aspects of the vehicle search they potentially made the venue vulnerable most notably the closeness of the vehicle search to the venue entrance and secondly the fact that the Jury&#039;s Inn was effectively an unprotected site caused vulnerability.
1,21208,4889,21117,In the event of a critical incident, there would have been some questions as to the command structure and clarity of roles. I would argue that there were too many Silvers within the structure and that whilst things generally went ok, I am not sure that the integrity of the structure would have survived real stress.
1,21209,4880,21115,Role clarity. If things had gone wrong, which Silver was in overall command of all resources? Particularly difficult as we were outside NPIA guidlines. This was addressed through written protocol but may have left us exposed.<br />Proximity of Silver to the venue. In the event of LVBIED, this would have caused issues. Need to balance operational  effectiveness of this with the risk it brings.
1,21210,4883,21116,NOTE TO FACILITATOR This should have been attached to question three
1,21211,4891,21116,The location of the silver command was too close to the conference site. This should have been facilitated at another location.
1,21212,4886,21117,Did the planning team have the requisite experience and knowledge to complete their individual roles ?<br />It should have been &#039;best person for the job&#039; based on skills and experience<br />The time given to plan the event was too short a timescale exacerbated by some very late decisions from the Home Office re funding.<br />There needs to be much earlier decisions regarding funding
1,21213,4891,21211,This comment is in relation to question 3
1,21214,4879,21117,1. The operation was not in line with current ACPO guidelines or consistent with the other 2 party conference operations which faced the same threats. I don&#039;t know what more we could have done about this...<br />2. Length of time firearms and armed prot officers were on duty. In relation to first we built in sufficient &#039;down time&#039; but could still have been subject to challenge re working hours and in the second we had to do some accommodating mid-operation, but if they&#039;d shot anyone we could have been subject to challenge...i think
1,21215,4877,21117,The number of police officers on the operation was excessive. Many of the static points were suitable for G4S or other security companies to cover. They were working teh same event as the polcie and subject therefore to the same level of threat as the officers and yet they did not require the wearing of body armour. This indicates that the site threat level was low and therefore less police officers could have been deployed and better use of private security made. This would have reduced the policing costs and helped set a precedent for the future policing of conferences at the venue. Shhould the threat from terrorism be higher then numbers could be adjusted accordingly but given a low threat on this occasion the number of police officers dedicated to static points could have been significantly reduced.
1,21216,4884,21117,See last bullet point for 2b - entered in wrong section<br />3. We would have had a problem with a Silver plan that was not created in tried and tested Merseyside format. The plan was, until quite late in the pre event phase, modelled on a GMP format. Although this was rectified - it would have almost certainly attracted comment should it have remained as it was and something had gone wrong
1,21217,4879,21117,re 2. point we could either have built in extra staff to reduce working day or maybe put plans to external scrutiny for external opinion?
1,21218,4882,21117,Was the protest site at the correct location for the protesters.<br />The area was not suitable for standing for long periods of time.<br />mainly  hidden from view and not very inviting.<br />More pressure to be put on land owners  due to the site constraints and multiple ownership.<br />Was silver control in the correct loaction.<br />Too close to the event and could have been in the cordon area in the event of terrorist threat or car bomb etc.<br />Could have had link and room at alternative location with some if not all facilities in case of one of above.
1,21219,4887,21117,Time scales for plans dictated that written documents were submitted and tested at both tabletop exercise and adversarial briefing before the plans were finalised, ( for example the appointing of the private security company) This was as a result of the Home Office delaying the funding decision and left the Merseyside Police in a potentially vulnerable position.<br />The late provision of an event specific threat assessment dictated that planning was Limited  Home office funding would have left Merseyside Police struggling to upgrade plans if the event specific threat assessment had indicated a higher than anticipated threat.
1,21220,4888,21117,1. Too many Police officers engaged on the operation, who could have been otherwise engaged preventing crime and disorder in their own areas.<br />An earlier resourcing decision would have enabled the size of the operation to be scaled down.<br />2. You never utilised any of the extended police family such as PCSO&#039;s and Specials.<br />Consideration to use of such resources in future to relieve the burden on frontline officers
1,21221,4885,21117,The integration between the police and the private security firms fronting the event whilst apaprent in terms of relationship did not transpose to physical activity.  The security companies failed each of the tests put to them, which could have compromised the event security.<br />The big wheel was a potential risk on a number of fronts.  I wonder whether this should have been stopped.
1,21222,4897,21153,FAC - what was the operational impact of &quot;too many cooks?&quot; Can you give a concrete example?
1,21223,4897,21155,FAC - how should that isolted decision making have been prevented? Who should silvers have been making decisions with?
1,21224,4897,21155,FAC - what kind of key people? What roles were excluded? (if this can be answered without naming specific names)
1,21225,4894,21164,FAC - Where in particular do you believe the extra officers would be needed?
1,21226,4897,21160,FAC - How small was too small? How much bigger did the team need to be?
1,21227,4894,21167,FAC - If it wasn&#039;t possible to increase planning time, are there any other ways that event planning could be improved?
1,21228,4894,21168,FAC - How would you have increased security to the hotel?
1,21229,4880,21191,FAC - Is it appropriate for unarmed officers within a pre planned firearms operation not to be wearing body armour?
1,21230,4894,21171,FAC - Other than the complication of having a number of Silver Commanders, are there any other reasons you can think of for decisions not being made quicker than they were?
1,21231,4880,21192,FAC - what specifically about the silver control room made it unsuitable?
1,21232,4897,21198,What do you think was lacking from the strategy - can you give a concrete example/details?
1,21233,4894,21173,FAC - What did you mean specifically by a &#039;fending off process&#039;?
1,21234,4897,21164,FAC - do you think stress was a problem? For whom? How did it show up?
1,21235,4880,21196,FAC - what made this situation &#039;unanticipated&#039; ? Does housing Protection Team officers in the principal hotel raise its own risk?
1,21236,4880,21205,FAC- was there a CBRN threat to justify keeping these staff separate?
1,21237,4897,21182,FAC - can you specify what you mean by a willingness to listen? In what way did this NOT happen?
1,21238,4884,21192,where should it be ?
1,21239,4894,21176,FAC - Can you provide an example of how the &#039;fixer&#039; role worked well?
1,21240,4897,21179,FAC - please expand on why/in what way you think it worked well.
1,21241,4880,21156,Can you give examples of meetings which excluded key people?
1,21242,4879,21191,And we say low threat but the whole operation was hardly policed to that level, was it?
1,21243,4897,21180,FAC - can you give concrete example of successful partnership working? With which agency(ies)?
1,21244,4882,21156,Why were there so many silvers?<br />Should the model of other events not have been used with one overall and many bronze commanders?
1,21245,4879,21195,Re accreditation - does it make any sense for us to do it ourselves? could we get a better standard of service from GMP if we managed it differently? what are the options?
1,21246,4885,21178,In terms of the firearms operation the advanced briefing covering all the contingencies worked well.
1,21247,4877,21176,What is a fixer?
1,21248,4889,21189,I agree, the intelligence flow was poor and failed to aid rational decision making re resources or threat.
1,21249,4897,21188,FAC - is anything planned to feed this positive response/comments back to those invovled?
1,21250,4877,21188,Yes - all the staff received some form of recognition in person at the closure of the event. (personal thank you, mentioned on force DVD of event)
1,21251,4884,21218,Where would you have put it ?
1,21252,4880,21228,This must either be an island site or not. There are no half way houses.
1,21253,4897,21200,FAC - can you give a concrete example of how these decisions impacted the operation?
1,21254,4879,21188,Was it luck that we got really good people in the hotel liaison roles? How do we make sure they&#039;re really good people next time? did they get a briefing specific to their role?
1,21255,4877,21191,re FAC - possibly not but if this is the case then how do the security staff who are potentially at the same risk manage?<br />I certainly agree the event was not policed to &#039;low&#039; however this was a first time event and a de-brief should bring out those issues
1,21256,4897,21212,FAC - was the requisite experience/knowledge available to be deployed?
1,21257,4894,21209,FAC - Can you suggest more suitable locations to base the Silver Command Unit?
1,21258,4882,21189,Why was this, at every silver meeting it all seemed ok in fact everyone at every silver meeting said that everything was ok.<br />I think this was the meeting which achieved the least
1,21259,4884,21211,Where ?
1,21260,4896,21208,FAC - solution?
1,21261,4897,21214,FAC - what aspects did not comply with ACPO Guidelines?
1,21262,4886,21254,We asked for experienced officers from the Academy primarily and they were briefed
1,21263,4884,21253,Yes - protest site and Gold reserves
1,21264,4882,21192,This was due to the number of Silver commanders with a reducd input this may have worked better, too many cooks maybe?
1,21265,4894,21215,FAC - Where there particular areas where you thought too many officers had been deployed and why?
1,21266,4887,21219,Should read ---- The late provision of an event specific threat assessment dictated that planning was to the generic threat levels. Limited funding meant that if the evnet specific threat assessment had indicated a raised threat Merseyside Police would have struggled to upgrade plans to resond.
1,21267,4889,21211,In a perfect world I would agree with this however, the resources required to establish an alternative would be better spent on other aspects of the Operation. Fundamentally, the potential risk to the Silver Suite is surely outweighed by other unmitigated risks such as to the hotel venue.
1,21268,4886,21242,The threat to the event was Moderate not LOW. The event specfic threat from IRT was moderate .
1,21269,4877,21171,Silvers have a tendency to wander around venues, as do Gold leaders. whilst it is nice to know that leaders care there is a clear command structure designed to ensure that compromises do not happen. Too many silvers or interference by continually wandering around can have an adverse effect as staff don&#039;t really understand who is in charge and decision making gets delayed.
1,21270,4884,21214,Silver PSU
1,21271,4886,21194,That is exactly what was asked for e.g A silver Plan writer and accommodation at HQ (both of which were refused ! )
1,21272,4880,21215,I would much rather put my faith in a police officers ability to perform a key function. A single breach of the venue could have resulted in a requirement to research the whole CC.
1,21273,4877,21254,The staff that were appointed were ideal but I don&#039;t think the police is very scientific in its resource planning - we may ask for &#039;experienced officers&#039; but we don&#039;t often know what we want them for or to do
1,21274,4886,21245,Discussions have already taken place with GMP regarding teh next conference with a detailed MOU being proposed.<br />Some of the problems may have been down to personaility issues from key staff
1,21275,4882,21207,There was a large concentration of officers at this location and if a vehicle bourne device had been delivered we could have been compromised.
1,21276,4894,21221,FAC - Could you please elaborate on what the role of security firms where and how do you believe they failed in the tasks?
1,21277,4883,21222,Yes the protest site was determined by the public order silver without recourse to the event silver
1,21278,4884,21200,Additional meetings outside of the structure, the need for more detailed command protocol and disputes relating to resources within Gold reserve
1,21279,4877,21242,The threat changed (according to the briefings) as the event went on. The point has been made to show that we are often risk averse and that many other staff at the event did not have access to body armour - maybe we build in extra breaks or have staff standing around in kit for less time or don&#039;t work 12 hour duties.
1,21280,4880,21223,By having a single Silver, issues such as the multi tasking of Matrix could have been avoided. Everything needs to go through the single Silver to Gold
1,21281,4884,21258,Meetings in the margins adveresly affetcred the formal meeting structure
1,21282,4886,21216,Regarding the Silver Plan we need to make a decision whether it is in COPSCORE format or IIMARCH.<br />In my view IIMARCH was not appropriate for some of the plans e.g the Search Plan
1,21283,4884,21271,This appears to be a common theme ...
1,21284,4879,21214,Island site, Remote vehicle search, searched and secured main conference hotel, accreditation of delegates... HO refused funding for all (or party could not provide necessary info in case of accreditation)
1,21285,4885,21211,Whilst this is accepted from a purists view.  The operational command was far more effective from HQ than a remote site.
1,21286,4888,21226,My particular side which was Logistics (resourcing, transport, catering, accommodation, equipment) consisted of myself and 3. Given the impact of the summer annual leave period and actual amount of work involved it was clearly not enough people.<br />A team of 6 would give some resilience.<br />Other aspects of the wider team such as Briefings consisted of one person who could clearly need more full time help - at least 2 people.
1,21287,4887,21253,The public order Silver Commander requested specialist resources which were pivotal to other aspects of the operation. This request was made / authorised outside of a meeting process and led to significant planning / resourcing difficulties for other aspects of the operation.
1,21288,4882,21183,Due to budget cuts and the fact that officers are retireing on a daily basis where is this going to leave us as a lot of experienece is going out of the door?
1,21289,4889,21228,I would have preferred the hotel to have been fully searched, sealed and secure with controlled access to accredited personnel / delegates. Whilst the conference venue was secure, there was nothing to stop a person simply walking into the hotel and detonating a device or causing us to have to evacuate in the case of a hoax bomb call.
1,21290,4883,21118,Clear command structure with one silver commander responsible for planning supprorted by a planning team.<br />Early decisions around resourcing to ensure that people are clear at an early stage what will be required of them during the conference peiod.<br />A new silver control with sufficient space to conduct a multiagency operation.
1,21291,4888,21118,1. A clear command structure from the outset  i.e one Silver Commander<br />2. Planning process to commence at least 6 months prior to the event<br />3. Final resourcing decision to be made no later than 4 months prior to the event.
1,21292,4891,21118,clear command structure<br />sufficient time to plan<br />earlier resource decisions
1,21293,4879,21118,a. Sufficient continuity/experience from this year in key command roles<br />b. Lead decision making role of Event Silver clear in planning stages (with reference to Gold)<br />c. Embed (and protect) Planning Team in Force Ops
1,21294,4889,21118,Clear command structure with single overall Silver at anyone time. All functional roles e.g. firearms / PO etc to be Bronze roles working to overall Silver.<br />Principle Conference Hotel to be secure to same standard as conference venue.<br />Earlier settlement of resource allocation with stakeholders.
1,21295,4877,21118,1. Establish the command structure - in respect of numbers of Silvers<br />2. Where possible ensure that the event if policed by the same staff each day<br />3. Make better use of private security, PCSOs (if they exist in the future and special)
1,21296,4886,21118,The Gold Strategy, Command protocols, tactical parameters and intelligence requirement must be set very early on in the planning process to provide direction.<br />We need an early decision regarding funding from the Home Office (at least nine months Prior) forgive me for being cynical but this will not happen<br />Continuity in the planning team roles
1,21297,4880,21118,Re model planning team into Force Ops with control being from event Silver and Gold, through CSupt Force Ops.<br />Early decisions re Island Site, RVSS and hotel security (buy out etc).<br />Better structured resourcing to reduce briefing and improve hand over times
1,21298,4882,21118,1.Home office to fund the security operation.<br />2.Good and strong leadership, and an early decision making process.<br />3.Sufficent time and the people required in the planning team.
1,21299,4887,21118,1) Establish a planning ream with the skills and experience to deliver all aspects of the plan, ensure that the planning team has the resillience to manage the operation fully, ensure that the planning team is established early to influence the planning process.<br />2) Review the Command structure to ensure a single Silver Commander.<br />3) Liaise with other Conference Forces and idenfiy funding issues with the Home Office Early in the process.
1,21300,4886,21118,Clarity in the roles within the planning team
1,21301,4884,21118,(1)Early nomination of the Event Silver with a command structure that clealry places this person at the &#039;head of the table&#039; in terms of tactical delivery.<br />(2) Force Operations should be more involved. I would recommend that they should take responsibility for the Silver plan. This supports the Conference Team and provides resilience<br />(3) Force capability eg  PSU, EGT , Search allre quire scrutiny. Are we fit to fight ?&#039; Are we ready for the auumn oif discontent ?

1,21424,4942,21411,Yeah, kind of :o)
1,21425,4930,21421,I worked as a butler once...
1,21426,4930,21395,Unsure about how to go about collecting Data for my Dissertation
1,21427,4941,21395,I am particularly anxious about the statistics program. I feel that it is way over my head and I have begun to bring articles to read throughout as it is more productive. Particularly the sessions relating to the new stats progam &#039;R&#039;.
1,21428,4940,21395,Getting everything done in time for the March deadlines
1,21429,4937,21395,not having enough time to do the assessments. it would be good if things were a little more spread out, e.g. we finish essays before we start the new module
1,21430,4942,21395,I wouldn&#039;t call it an anxiety but obviously the course is quite stressful when the deadlines are near and you worry about how are you going to finish everything on time.
1,21431,4943,21428,I agree!!! I am super stressed!!! Everything seems to be going over my head and I&#039;m getting super stressed
1,21432,4935,21395,I am unsure about what to do from now on considering the little time we have left in uni. Whether to move home or stay here etc. Staying here would be exceptionally lonesome considering the lack of lectures.
1,21433,4939,21395,I&#039;m having problems following the stats class - esp R. I&#039;ve always been quite weak at stats and was kindof hoping that the classes will start with the basic of MANOVA, ANCOVA and stuff...and the R prog isn&#039;t helping with my understanding.#
1,21434,4936,21395,My major anxieties are surrounding job hunting/applying.  It would be helpful to have a day or two concerning specific jobs,application process, what to expect
1,21435,4941,21396,I am considering interviewing and would like to work with Graham Wagstaff and/or Jacqueline Wheatcroft.
1,21436,4933,21395,I have serious concerns about carrying out the statistics on my dissertation as for the last few years I have become familiar with SPSS and now have to learn a totally new method called r-language that while good in theory uses way too much syntax and has gone over most of the classes head and i&#039;m sure everyone will end up trying to learn the SPSS methods on their own
1,21437,4936,21427,I agree, R makes me anxious
1,21438,4942,21427,Well, you don&#039;t have to use the R program for your dissertation. I just think it&#039;s to give us a benefit of knowing another stats program. And it&#039;s always good to put it on your CV
1,21439,4934,21395,I think the statistics program is a little difficult for most of us to follow. Because of this, it gets boring too!!!
1,21440,4933,21427,i totally agree i&#039;m going to have to just learn spss for my stats on my own :(
1,21441,4939,21433,Why can&#039;t we work with SPSS? I can&#039;t even do MANOVA, multiple regression no SPSS...how am I going to understand it with R?
1,21442,4936,21396,Child interviewing, working with Jacqueline
1,21443,4940,21396,Autism awareness, Jacqueline Wheatcroft is my supervisor
1,21444,4930,21440,SPSS is still widely used, and quite accesible in terms of clarity and ease of use
1,21445,4943,21434,This would be really benefitial .. I brought this up  a while back I def think it would be useful
1,21446,4933,21438,well yes but it would be of far more benefit to learn the method that you will be using in your dissertation rather than something for the cv
1,21447,4937,21441,i agree, idont understand why we have to learn a new program when the majority of us have used spss at undergrad
1,21448,4941,21438,I know we don&#039;t have to, but I feel the time would be put to better use in enhancing our knowlesge of SPSS. They could offer option classes for R. IE. make them compulsory for only the RM students.
1,21449,4935,21439,I think learnign a new program is good. I don&#039;t think the problem is learning R&lt; I think that it is the way we are taught it.<br />Having a additinoal tool under our belt does make you more employable.
1,21450,4937,21396,male rape working with louise
1,21451,4930,21441,Nothing limits your choice of program or Stats. As long as you argue correctly why you choose a specific one!
1,21452,4942,21429,Definitely agree with that. If the workload was more spreaded throughout the year it would be less stressful. Or even having one of the assigments during the course of one module and then having another assignment in at the end.
1,21453,4934,21396,Child abuse victims interviewing with Jacqueline
1,21454,4939,21395,on the module on police and crime reduction, I was hoping to learn more theories on the various areas..for e.g. leadership during critical incident, decision-making under stress, theories underlying management of human intelligence etc
1,21455,4935,21436,In fairness, I think it is unlikely that we are going to use R for dissertations. Hence, why learing it could be perceived as relatively pointless.
1,21456,4941,21434,I agree. I don&#039;t have any idea what direction to go in/what job opportunities want our MSc. I have google though..
1,21457,4933,21434,Oh god yes!!!<br />we seriously need to know about jobs because I have no idea where to start or what sort of job i will be qualified for and it&#039;s getting a bit overwhelming especially considering that deadlines can be quite early!
1,21458,4935,21396,Laurence.. But because of his absense I think I will be co-supervised by Jacqueline.
1,21459,4937,21451,but we dont even get assessed on this new method
1,21460,4932,21458,What area where you thinking of?
1,21461,4939,21396,Leadership in high reliability organisations - I&#039;m hoping to work with either Laurence or Louise
1,21462,4933,21449,not if you don&#039;t know how to use it!
1,21463,4933,21435,me too!
1,21464,4930,21459,Would you prefer to be assessed, in order to encourage one method over another?
1,21465,4944,21396,Looking at interviewing with Graham
1,21466,4936,21397,perspectives from a different country
1,21467,4941,21397,After publication of my undergraduate diss I hope I can continue this research and contribute to the development of effective interviewing skills for the police, particularly for witnesses. With focus on practicality. I.e. Something that is easy and quick for the police to use and something that will be acceptable in the courts. This hopefully will centre around the development of The Liverpool Interview Protocol and its trial run in Derby.,
1,21468,4930,21450,Any specific questions relating to this area?
1,21469,4937,21459,it would just give me piece of mind that i am using the program correctly rather than just going through it in class with little guidence
1,21470,4939,21428,I agree too.. There&#039;s quite a bit going on, papers and dissertation presentation. Quite a lot of lit review to be done to prep for the various papers --&gt; esp dissertation as the area is new and has not been covered by the course.
1,21471,4930,21458,Any particular areas of interest?
1,21472,4935,21395,My anxiety is the massive amount of time we have between now and the deadline. Without lectures and contact hours as a group, I think I may become:<br />1. Lonely.<br />2. Dis-engaged.<br />Whilst the time is good, I would have rather done the dissertation whilst studying a additional unit.<br />This also raises the question of accomodation. Home vs. staying here.<br />In all honesty I am genuinly dissapointed with the small amount of lectures we actually have. 3 week blocks, with half days, for a Master&#039;s study I was expecting it to be slightly more intense.
1,21473,4944,21397,Errmmm this is a tricky one ....
1,21474,4940,21397,wisdom
1,21475,4934,21466,me too!!!
1,21476,4936,21473,agree
1,21477,4933,21467,i cast doubt on the extent of your contribution to this article...except of course for any spelling mistakes...
1,21478,4942,21454,I agree with this. When we said something like that to Laurence, like that there wasn&#039;t enough psychology in it, he just replied that its our job to find psychology in it which is quite fair but in the end we are studying psychology so he should have given us at least some basic theories.
1,21479,4934,21473,i second that
1,21480,4937,21450,i am doing a multi variate model of male on male rape using scas data
1,21481,4933,21397,a good critical mind and keen interest
1,21482,4944,21435,Lets steal each others participants!!
1,21483,4930,21473,Why tricky?
1,21484,4941,21397,Good looks.
1,21485,4944,21400,Meeting people<br />The naught y treats<br />the experience
1,21486,4930,21474,Wisdom on any particular topic, or just overall about anything?
1,21487,4939,21400,Sharing by practitioners, interesting lectures, meeting people
1,21488,4935,21400,1. The oppertunity to meet exceptional practitioners. Having these experiences and interactios makes it very easy to sound good in an interview.<br />2. the variety of academic tasks we are required to do. court reports, essays and reviews are all new skills aquired.<br />3. The MSc room and tea making facilities. A god send,.
1,21489,4934,21483,I dont think there have been contributions from me, thats why!
1,21490,4933,21400,it is so applied orientated so you can see how the stuff that you learn can be applied in real settings that you may not have realized.<br />the interesting variety of guest speakers make the course<br />the lecturers are all quite approachable and usually happy to help
1,21491,4939,21395,Transfering and applyign the knowledge we have learnt in an actual work setting
1,21492,4940,21400,learning things about crimes that we can&#039;t tell other people - makes me feel special, but not in a &#039;my mum thinks I&#039;m special kind of way&#039;, also the people I&#039;ve met are great and most of the content has been really interesting
1,21493,4941,21400,1-Getting contacts/your face recognised in possible job areas.<br />2-Interest and information of practically EVERY lecture. inc. the visiting speaker. Apart from maybe stats.<br />3-the kitchen. I love a good brew.<br />4-Friends I have made, both students and staff
1,21494,4942,21396,I wanted to do comparison between children abduction cases and missing children cases and I&#039;ve done a lot of preparation on it already (proposal, literature review) but Louise told me that there&#039;s not enough data so she&#039;s now suggested to do it on grooming which will be quite boring I think, but at least I have a topic to do and don&#039;t have to think of anything else which was quite hard for the first topic.
1,21495,4936,21400,1) guest speakers - networking, hearing about their experiences<br />2) meeting people - group dinners!!<br />3) the range of assessments to prepare us for actual work assignments
1,21496,4930,21488,Just &#039;sound&#039; good during an interview... no confidence on possibly even being good?
1,21497,4936,21488,MSc room is AMAZING
1,21498,4935,21400,Ensuring that if I have to turn to criminality I am one step ahead of the authorities.
1,21499,4942,21484,HAHA!!
1,21500,4936,21401,1) lecture end so early - already done<br />2) just now getting access cards, sucks being locked out in the cold :(<br />3) would have liked a few more hands on experience - going places, seeing actual work environments
1,21501,4939,21401,more interaction time with my course mates would be good
1,21502,4940,21401,Stats, deadlines, Laurence-esque comments
1,21503,4941,21401,1-irregular lecture times<br />2-inconsistency in marking from different tutors.<br />3-I can&#039;t think of anything else. I&#039;ll get back to you.
1,21504,4936,21498,&#039;like&#039;
1,21505,4934,21400,1. Its like a culture capital, meeting people from so many different countries.<br />2. Lectures by practitioners, who talk about the difficulties and practicalities.<br />3. And the fact that everyone whom I tell what course I am doing thinks I am a mind reader!!!
1,21506,4934,21498,super-like!!!
1,21507,4937,21401,Stats!!<br />deadlines<br />cant think of a third
1,21508,4935,21401,The lecture slots and timetable.<br />Oh yes. Inconsistency in marking. Told one thing by a lecturer, only to have been punished for this in the last essay.
1,21509,4944,21401,Stats ... in particular R!!!<br />Having some of the deadlines close together or when we have a new module starting ... makes things very stressful<br />Irregular feedback .. or feedback that contradicts itself
1,21510,4939,21401,Stats... It&#039;s been a struggle
1,21511,4936,21503,very inconsistent in marking; but could be good to handle a variety of boss&#039;s/job expectations
1,21512,4937,21510,agree
1,21513,4933,21401,the lack of training in advanced SPSS methods is my primary concern. or even an introductory class to r-language rather than diving into regression on day 1.<br />maybe spreading out some of the deadlines such as having a presentation at the same time as 2 assignments.<br />lack of facility to help with obtaining placements.
1,21514,4944,21510,R has gone over so many heads
1,21515,4941,21401,oh yea! And the computers. Saving a doc opened from an attachment doesn&#039;t actually save it and i&#039;ve lost lots of work becuase of this. Not really the course, more the library. But it ruins my life every time it happens.
1,21516,4930,21510,Again, is R so bad?
1,21517,4941,21502,LIKE
1,21518,4939,21401,Would love more time to engage each topic in further depth - e.g. interviewing etc.
1,21519,4935,21401,Dissertation selection. Whilst I enjoy the oppertunity to construct our own. data collection can seem ambiguous, and until confirmed it is very stressful. So rather than pick a topic interested in, it feels as if you must find data then construct a question.
1,21520,4944,21500,Field trips would have been great .. especially after being told about previous ones
1,21521,4942,21492,Yeah, that makes me feel special too. Lol!
1,21522,4934,21401,Stats!!<br />Assessment inconsistencies!
1,21523,4935,21518,Couldn&#039;t agree more. I have been gonig to court which has made this unit far more enjoyable.
1,21524,4944,21501,Night out soon?
1,21525,4936,21524,yes
1,21526,4933,21519,yes it is a bit daunting because there are so many different choices that i just end up like a deer in headlights.
1,21527,4930,21518,Have you tried engaging some of the supervisors/researchers on this?
1,21528,4940,21518,I concur. I&#039;d love to go into personality disorders and intellectual difficulties a bit more
1,21529,4941,21428,Agreed.
1,21530,4935,21401,Irrelevant. But I really should mention Ian.<br />Without him taknig his time to come to our lectures they would not have been half as good.<br />Studying with CAMI only for stats is a waste. I would rather, as much as possible, full integration
1,21531,4937,21523,yeah i agree court has been really helpful, just in getting an idea of what actually happens in a case
1,21532,4933,21523,court tomorrow woooooo<br />if i make it....
1,21533,4936,21518,court is amazing! I do feel like we had a good overview but more in depth on certain topics would have been great
1,21534,4944,21516,It hasn&#039;t be taught in the best of ways esp as its more directed at Research Methods
1,21535,4934,21516,its not that bad, if u understand it!!! For that people need to pay attention in class, which most of us dont do!!!
1,21536,4942,21500,I agree with your 3rd comment. I think it would be brilliant if we could actually go out and try out something in the field or just observe as part of the course.
1,21537,4941,21429,Agreed
1,21538,4937,21530,i agree. Ian has been a star
1,21539,4944,21530,Agreeeeeed!!
1,21540,4933,21516,it obviously must be if the whole class are having difficulties!
1,21541,4936,21530,like
1,21542,4934,21530,i agree too!!1
1,21543,4940,21522,Here here
1,21544,4936,21530,like
1,21545,4937,21530,plus he has been a god save for seminar days
1,21546,4940,21530,Love
1,21547,4939,21530,Ian&#039;s been great indeed!
1,21548,4934,21545,yup!!!
1,21549,4935,21522,I personally don&#039;t mind stats.<br />Consider the following line<br />&quot; I have studied statistics and Advanced statistics at undergraduate and post graduate level. I also have a wealth of practical experience with SPSS and R&quot;.<br />Screams &quot;employ me now&quot;<br />I would be more stressed if I was doing a dissertation and reliant on my undergraduate statistics.
1,21550,4933,21501,yeah we have to make sure we meet up once class ends!!!!<br />cos stats can&#039;t be the only thing that holds us together!
1,21551,4941,21482,DEAL
1,21552,4944,21525,We all need to get diaries out as soon out deadlines are over :)
1,21553,4933,21517,risque
1,21554,4930,21524,Could you elaborate on what you mean by this?
1,21555,4933,21511,i can see the logic in this
1,21556,4934,21549,I think i know who this is!!
1,21557,4933,21530,ian has been great, he&#039;s like our dad in a weird ian kind of way
1,21558,4941,21498,hahaha. Me too man.
1,21559,4941,21492,Aww you guys. you ARE special.
1,21560,4935,21549,To address this. I mentionned my use of R in an interview as a crime analyst, and they didn&#039;t know what it was
1,21561,4944,21549,Big fat lie on your CV ....  Sounds good but when they ask you to do it .. its a no go!!!
1,21562,4941,21505,I love this too.
1,21563,4941,21530,AND he helped us ALL with our seminar day. The little superstar.
1,21564,4942,21530,Yeah, Ian is really the best. He made such a contribution to the course. Also think that some lectures should be shared with the CAMI students so we can then asked them for access to some data as most of them are policemen/ policewoman.
1,21565,4935,21561,If it is no good it is my lack of preperation for the interview.<br />I haven&#039;t &quot;studied the intricies of significant hypothesis testing&quot; either, but I can talk as if i have.
1,21566,4939,21395,Well, it may be too late now. But it would be great if we could do advanced stats all over again...using SPSS and going down to basic...starting from multiple regression, anova... what to use what method..how to use it on spss..
1,21567,4933,21535,i know but the reason that happens is people end up getting frustrated and even when i asked a question it can be difficult to get an answer.
1,21568,4934,21560,What if they ask you to explain wht it is!! Its like purposely placing ur head under the axe!
1,21569,4937,21516,i just dont think it is being taught in the right way, it might be better to have a more step by step lecture, and u go through the steps rather than just have a two hour lecture and then go away and try to do it on ur own
1,21570,4941,21400,I love the fact that some of us have started going down to court. its amazing. So interesting. We really hope that Mark wont get charged with murder. But Colin and Alan better.
1,21571,4933,21549,i&#039;d prefer to be capable at doing independent research.rather than bullshit on a cv
1,21572,4937,21567,i agree with this, it is very diffisult to get a straight answer when asking a question in stats
1,21573,4936,21564,thank you for being politically correct
1,21574,4944,21401,Inconsitencies with going for help. Some times we are given in direct help. I know we are Msc students but still need guidance
1,21575,4940,21486,anything
1,21576,4933,21401,PLEASE GIVE US SOMETHING ON SPSS OR I THINK I AM SCREWED!!!
1,21577,4935,21396,My dissertation issue is that it is involving a external body and this has made getting data far more stressful.
1,21578,4934,21576,i think R is over!! I think now Stacey is gonna take over!
1,21579,4944,21578,I hope so ... my dissertation my be safe
1,21580,4934,21579,ya she is gonna start soon! And i remember her saying that she uses SPSS
1,21581,4940,21520,definitely!
1,21582,4935,21576,We had things on SPSS with Louisse in the first unit. We have a handbook with step by step guides.
1,21583,4944,21571,Me too!!
1,21584,4942,21573,Lol! You&#039;re welcome.
1,21585,4933,21582,yeah i know, but a class or two would be nice
1,21586,4944,21530,It would have been really useful to have more time with the CAMI students instead of relying on just Ian. We only got a few weeks with them and it would have been nice to get more contacts and insights which we lost out on.
1,21587,4933,21551,who said this!
1,21588,4944,21396,It would have been useful to be given a deadline regarding access to information for dissertations at the beginning and where we could get info from. This would maybe give us more focus areas too.

1,21931,5093,21918,hat about the confirmed leaking gas, students are leaving of their own accord in any event, do we wish to contain them in an area where they may be overcome by the chemicals?
1,21932,5089,21908,Officers should not directly challenge.  Because this greatly increaes the risk to all and created conflict.  Contain and negotiate is the best option with a contignecy for intervention.

1,21983,5104,21939,Information and Intelligence is as given. Fact that x2 ARV&#039;s have been deployed and one AFO is down.

1,21985,5106,21939,I am making this decision as the TFC<br />Threat assessment is that we have armed suspects within premises, numbers not known, who have weapons and have fired at the ARV&#039;s and one officer has been hit and is injured, extent of which is not known. The kind of chemicals held within the premises are unkown at this time. It is also unknown if any hostages have been taken, or members of the public are within the premises. Potentially dangerous chemicals, gaseous are held within the premises.<br />Using CMM - Threat is from armed suspects and the chemicals they may have.<br />There is some intelligence from a previous intranet search that premises like this may be tagetted which has CT link.<br />tactical options- they have fired at officers and members of the public are at serious risk as there is a clear danger to life.<br />Decision - ARV officers to engage and neutralise the threat.<br />Grounds - Officers and members of the public are at serious risk and the priority is to protect life and neutralise the threat.<br />Justification - By engaging the subjects the threat may be neutralised and members of the public protected and loss of life prevented. If no action is taken then there is a real prospect and liklihood of there being a loss of life to the public or police offices (JC)<br />They have committed serious offences to which there is a power of arrest
1,21986,5108,21939,1)  Known at this stage - Uni storeroom has been broken into.  This storeroom contains chemicals and some are known to be missing.  There are no witnesses to the break in at present although 2 suspects have been seen entering a room on the second floor of the building.  2 arvs have been deployed and are at the scene.  They have entered the building and made to the second floor where they have been fired upon by a suspect with a pistol and one officer is injured having been shot sustaining an injury to the arm.  Arv crews have returned fire but it is not known at this stage how many shots that have been fired.  It is unknown how many suspects are in the building at present.  It is known that there are other people within this building although it is not confirmed how many at present.  The identity of the suspect(s) is unknown at this time but they have discharged a firearm at officers so have shown an intent and capability.  I have reviewed the authority to arm at this stage and that authority continues as I have reason to believe that officers have to confront armed suspects.  (PC)
1,21987,5109,21939,I am taking on the role of TFC for this incident. The initial aim of the operation is to identify, locate and contain any threat. On the information available there is a likelihood that hostages have been taken. Subjects (number unknown) are armed and haveRisk here is a risk th  fired shots at officers. Only known casualties at this time is the one officer shot in the arm. There is also the risk that chemicals have been stolen to be used as or in the manufactour of chemical weapons. Decision - Contain and seek to make contact with offenders. (ss)
1,21988,5105,21939,Following briefing, I want to assume command, confirm authority for firearms is met, develop a working strategy and communicate it to the OfCom. I will want to consult a Firearms Tac Ad and and CBRN Tac Ad.<br />In brief I will want the firearms officer to engage and neutralise the firearms threat and thereafter to deal with the potential CBRN threat.<br />Rationale: There is an immediate threat to life from one or more persons with firearms and Article 2 is engaged.   The threat assessment to students, employees and officers deployed to this incident is high.<br />There is a potential secondary threat to life from the CBRN material that may be in the possession of the subjects. I do not know what the subject&#039;s intention is in relation to the use/discharge of that material at this location. lol
1,21989,5103,21939,Info/Intel - report of burglary at Bangor university where chemicals have been stolen. It is not known at this stage what these chemicals could be used for (need clarity on the chemicals and what they could be used for). Police have attended and report a suspicious vehicle outside with maps of university campus (who owns this, where are they)made contact with at least one suspect reported as carrying a self loading pistol. Subject has fired at police and caused injury to one AFO. It is not known who the subject is or what their intention, I would deem this person as EMD due to their behaviour and the situation. There are a number of other persons in the university building.<br />Threat Assessment - Officer down requires medical attention - High Risk as severity of injuries not known. Students/tutors on campus - high risk as they are in vicinity of armed subject. Other AFOs - Medium risk (due to equipment and training), but will increase at point of contact. Subject - High at oint of contact with police.<br />Strategy - Minimise the risk the students/employees/visitors to the university. Maximise safety of officers. Minimise the risk to the subject. Continue to develop intelligence. Locate and secure the missing chemicals.Arrest the subject for offences committed. Secure and preserve evidence. Return the area to a state of normality as soon as possible once the threat has been neutralised.<br />Tactical Options (I have consulted DC Siebenman as Tac Ad)- 1. Wait - dismissed - The subject has already shot one officer and the Tac advice suggests that the chemicals stolen can pose a threat to health<br />More To Follow (DO)
1,21990,5106,21939,In addition there is also a threat regarding the chemicals believed to be liquid cesium however it is not known what the purpose of the burglary is or whether or not the subject(s) have been in contact/utilised the chemicals. Control must be maintained of these chemicals as soon as possible which must include control of the subject(s) to ensure the chemicals do not leave the premises.(JC)
1,21991,5110,21939,Set up inner cordon around area - CBRN advisor to give realistic inner cordon parameters and outer cordon parameters<br />Evacuate all persons within inner cordon immediately -<br />Intelligence and information required from OIC at scene re number of suspects and weaponry and precise location - reason is to make more informed decision as to resoursoces required.<br />Information required re contents of cylindars - reason is to set  up correct CBRN procedures<br />Intell required re suspects - known / afiliations / beliefs etc  CO
1,21992,5108,21939,The suspects may be in possession of sezium or other chemicals from the store room and it is not known what there intention is at this stage with the chemicals.  Tac advisor has bee consulted in relation to these and advice will be appended to this log.<br />My strategy at this stage is to protect the members of the public who are in the immediate vicinity ie in the university building (high risk), to minimise harm to other members of the public outside of the university building (medium risk at present), to contain the suspects in the building together with any chemical that they may possess, to maximise the saftety of both armed and unarmed officers attending at the scene (high risk to officers).  (PC)
1,21993,5106,21939,Authenticate - CBRN expert advice has been provided is that the chemical is presently in an inert form and is fatal if released. It is not known at this stage what quantity is present and if released subject to weather conditions how far this could be spread in the locality.
1,21994,5103,21939,Tactical Options continued - 2. Develop intelligence - adopted their are currently gaps in the info/intel and this will tend to fill these gaps, whilst not precluding other tactical options. 3- Contain and Communicate -dopted. This can commence immediately with a view to securing the peaceful surrender of the subject (negotiator to be called out). 4. Direct Action - Dismissed at this time - intention of the subject is not known, tac ad suggests insufficient resources to neutralise the threat. CBRN tac ad suggest that inadvertantly rupturing the packaging of the chemical (bullet hole or subject dropping cannister) could lead to substance becoming airborne as the chemical is radioactive the consequences to health over a wide area are high.<br />More to Follow (DO)
1,21995,5108,21939,CBRN advises that seizium is in the form of a liquid which is held in a pressurised container.  If released then this could become gaseous and radioactive.  Information to be passed to team leader at the scene.<br />Intelligence has been obtained that internet chat rooms have carried details of such an offence and enquiries are underway in relation to the identities of the persons responsible. (PC)
1,21996,5106,21939,Authenticate - ARV officers engagement with the subjects, TAC Advice sought and in view of the engagement that has already occurred the preferred tactical option is to engage the threat using the ARV resources available.<br />Containment considered and not appropriate in view of the threat to life being immediate. (JC)
1,21997,5105,21939,lol - I would evacuate as much of the building as safely possible to minimise risk to people currently in the building. I would take cognisance of CBRN Tac Advice with regard to evacuation e.g. not downwind and awahy from line of sight of subjects current positioon and any potential crossfire. I would arrange the attendance of specialist resources to deal with any subsequent CBRN issues as they will take up to 1 hour to mobilise. I would seek additional firearms resources to contain and subsequently overwhelm the subjects. I would secure the services of a negotiator.
1,21998,5107,21939,There are further shots being fired. Information that potential hostages with suspects. Shouts and screams and shots being fired. Need to neutralise the threat both to the hostages and to general public if vapour realeased. Suspects need to neutralised by ARV officers as there is immediate threat to life.l<br />Need to evacuate area of Bangor downwind 200 metres. PRG<br />Nearest police officer to start evacuating. Further assistance by other officers and a Bronze to be identified.<br />Call out further ARVs to assist.<br />Call out CBRN
1,21999,5110,21939,Take them out - If clear shot of suspects shoot to kill. - reason - if cylindars are opened contents could be relaesed into environment.  If sylindars are taken out of location there is high probability of mass casualty / fatalities based upon known intelligence available of suspects and advice on cylindar contents from CBRN advisor CO
1,22000,5104,21939,Tactical Options and action<br />Wait and gather intelligence. Not adopted. There is need to act immediately to save and preservce life.<br />Allocate unarmed officers to the scene. Adopted. However the unarmed officers will be briefed to maintain an outer cordon to stop people entering the building. Additionally, to assist in evacuation of the building from the ground floor. Plans will now be drawn up for evacuation of the local area on the basis of the specialist advice.<br />Deployment of armed officers. Adopted. However, the armed officers have already taken a casualty. we also have information that there is a high risk of harm from the chemical and therefore to deploy AFOs to take direct action at this time constitutes an unacceptable risk. Therefore armed officers will be briefed to contain the immediate area where the subjects are belived to be located and to only take direct action at this time if life is in danger or there is a chance that the subjects leave the containment area with a weapon and/or chemical container. Life in danger will include continued shooting of hostages/MOP. The force firearms team have also been called to assist and will arrive in the next 15 minutes. A negotiator will be called into to attempt communication with the subjects as regards demands and intentions.<br />CBRN trained resources will be called to the scene with a view of being available for deployment when needed. They will have full protective equipment immediately available.<br />Contingencies include the potential for a vehicular escape. The force helicopter is beifed and within immediate reach at YG.<br />The RPU are also briefed and on scene. AW<br />I believe this to be the most proportionate response to the threat faced.
1,22001,5109,21939,Grounds - At this time limited resources available at the scene with uncertainty regarding the intention and capability of the offenders. CBRN equipped officers at least one hour from the scene. Threat assessment undertaken High risk to potential hostages and responding officers. Also high risk to wider public in the area, other emergency service staff and the offenders if chemical weapons used. Priority actions once containment achieved: 1 continue to develop infomation/intell regarding the subjects, chemicals on site.2. commence evacuation of the immediate  area and establish an outer cordon. 3. develop contingency plans for DA should life be at immediate risk (SS)
1,22002,5107,21939,Place outer cordon on premises - unarmed officers. PRG
1,22003,5108,21939,Call out of police CBRN team to make to forward rv point (to be nominated by bronze commander.<br />Bronze to be appointed<br />Firearms team call out together with non lethal options for deployment.<br />MacP request to be considered by gold - phone call to be made up front<br />Fire service and ambulance to be notified and deployed to forward point.  Fire service to identify de contamination area (PC)
1,22004,5103,21939,Contingencies - In consultation with Tac Ad I have considered the following; 1. Flight - nearest AFO to challenge the subject with direction to seek to prevent the substance from being allowed to leave the building (CBRN tac advice suggests that implications of this would be dire).
1,22005,5106,22000,You have assessed the risk to MOP as high, are they less important than police officers ? Shouldn&#039;t the ARV officers attempt to engage the subjects ?
1,22006,5105,22000,article 2 is engaged - shots are being fired now - CBRN threat is a possibility. ICI ( capability and intent) re. firearms is known ICI (capability and intent )re. CBRNis not known) therefore the firearms threat needs to be addressed first.
1,22007,5104,21985,Have ypou considered the following risks to the proposed action of direct action engagement:<br />1. Risk of further containation/explosion from chemicals in a firefight?<br />2. Risk to limited AFO resources if a firefight is instigated.<br />Have you considered deployment and negotiation?
1,22008,5109,21940,continue with current strategy of contain and seek to negotiate while other priority actions undertaken. Call out negotiator, CBRN tac ad and CBRN trained staff. (SS)
1,22009,5110,21995,How do you know ?  based upon what information ?
1,22010,5106,21999,Are you authorising officers to shoot to kill here?
1,22011,5104,22006,Disagree. shots have been fired and they are not necessarily continuing fire. . I&#039;ll have the capability is known; the intent is not. Where is the information that they simply do not want to negotiate. If we engage, there is an unacceptable risk that a) shots will hit the gas cannisters, thus releasing very harmful gas into the atmopsphere and potentially harming the wider public. and b) armed officers could easily be out-numbered and the immediate firearms capbility would be lost (until further resources are in place). I maintain the need is to negotiate until it is clear they are intent on destruction.
1,22012,5108,21990,How do you know its cesium<br />How do you know the suspects have the cesium with them<br />How do you know the chemicals are still in the building and there is not a greater risk
1,22013,5104,22005,Disagree. shots have been fired and they are not necessarily continuing fire. . I&#039;ll have the capability is known; the intent is not. Where is the information that they simply do not want to negotiate. If we engage, there is an unacceptable risk that a) shots will hit the gas cannisters, thus releasing very harmful gas into the atmopsphere and potentially harming the wider public. and b) armed officers could easily be out-numbered and the immediate firearms capbility would be lost (until further resources are in place). I maintain the need is to negotiate until it is clear they are intent on destruction.
1,22014,5106,21997,Who would you like to volunteer to evacuate, ARV officers?
1,22015,5109,21992,what is the decision?
1,22016,5108,21983,capability and intent are both known at this stage - firearm has been discharged - are you using this as thinking time
1,22017,5108,22009,Based on the information received from tac ad cbrn  and ctsa
1,22018,5103,21940,Communication from male person purporting to be the subject indication that they can see police. Caller states that they have 40 hostages and continued movement forward will result in the subject starting to kill the hostages in the next 3 minutes. However, it is not known precisely where the hostages are, how many hostage takers and weaponry.<br />Threat Assessment - the threat towards the hostages is high (based on comments of subject).<br />Tactical Options - based on the imprecise info/intel in relation to subject/location my strategy and tactical options remain as is - contain the threat and seek to communicate.<br />Actions - unarmed officers to put in place cordon and seek to secure evacuation as far as possible (utilise university staff and CCTV - whilst not exposing them to any further risk)<br />CBRN resources to scene<br />Helicopter to scene for aerial view and as a contingency to subject attempting to flee<br />Dog unit - as above<br />Task intel unit/SB to develop intel<br />(DO)
1,22019,5109,21999,how many offenders are there? if you kill one how do you think the others will react?
1,22020,5104,21940,establish and continue negotiation as planned in the tactical plan. It is evident that the subject(s) are not immediately intent on killing more people as they used the phrase, &#039;if you do not back off, I will&#039;.<br />Decision remains to contain and communicate at this stage as per the current threat assessment and working strategy. There are a lot of unknowns at this stage and we therefore need to seek clarity whilst maintaining and preserving life. AW
1,22021,5106,22005,Intelligence - 40 studenst being held now as hostages, if officers do not back off the subjects will shoot hostage within the next 3 minutes<br />Threat - Remains high to MOP and police officers<br />Powers - No Change<br />Tactical options - Armed containment and negotiate, develop dynamic entry plan
1,22022,5107,21939,Suspects have made contact and told officers not to enter otherwise they will shoot hostages.<br />Confirm with ARV at scene that no shots are currently being fired. If no shots being fired do not want to put 40 hostages at risk by entering building.<br />Call out negotiator.<br />ARVs to contain and not enter at present time unless further shots are heard.<br />Identify officer to try and contact suspect and negotiate until negotiator arrives. PRG
1,22023,5110,22010,Yes - decision based upon CBRN info re susbstance becoming gasseous if released from cannisters, met office info on wind direction and weather conditions at this time which suggest strongly that gas could be dispersed over a large area.  Area around location is highly populated which could result in mass casualties.<br />May be deaths of hostages but compared to number of deaths if not neutralised at earliest oppertunity this is the  best option at this stage.
1,22024,5105,21939,Having earlier secured the services of a negotiator I would now employ them in order to but my OfCom sufficient time to develop a dynamic intervention plan. I would ask the negotiaitor to establish the identity capability and intention of the subjects, continue to seek CBRN advice regarding the consequence of any firearms intervention and seek information regarding the potential CBRN consequences of positive firearms action upon the wider community, beyond the 40 hostages. lol
1,22025,5104,22016,Nope, but you have a correct point. In all honesty, I considered the capability was in fact known, but I&#039;d submitted it already! I do not accept the intent is known at this stage. Are you aware of demands etc?
1,22026,5105,22014,Unarmed resources on the first floor and in those areas of the second floor that it safe to do so taking advice from OfCom
1,22027,5107,21940,Suspects have made contact and told officers not to enter otherwise they will shoot hostages.<br />Confirm with ARV at scene that no shots are currently being fired. If no shots being fired do not want to put 40 hostages at risk by entering building.<br />Call out negotiator.<br />ARVs to contain and not enter at present time unless further shots are heard.<br />Identify officer to try and contact suspect and negotiate until negotiator arrives. PRG
1,22028,5110,22019,Based upon up-to-thee minute information we have at this time from officers at the scene and from the university re numbers of students / staff in the building I believe there are 5 suspects.  As many suspects as possible need to be neutralised at the earliest oppertunity
1,22029,5108,21940,Further information received from a person purporting to be a subject  Person phoning states that he has 40 hostages whom he will start to kill if the police officers do not back off.  Containment to be maintained by arv crews at this time and hostage negotiator cell to be deployed to the scene  Tac advice has been taken and the following options have now been discussed<br />1 do nothing - dismissed as there have been shots fired, the subject is/has been located and there is a probability of a large number fo hostages.  2) attempt to enter and engage the subject - dismissed at this stage due to the high risk of injury to the officers, hostages and subject.  3)  Contain the subject and attempt to negotiate - this is the preffered option at this stage.<br />Unarmed officers to place a cordon around the building

1,22085,5127,22031,Being cognisant of the demands and emotional state of the hostage taker, I am going to allow Sky to attend the scene.<br />My main aim is to secure the safe release of the children and adults, albeit I need to develop a plan to end the seige or intervene should the situation deteriorate.<br />I am concerned that to refuse the request at this time may lead to harm to those being held and I do not have an emergency entry team in place at this time.<br />The above is based upon the full co operation of Sky news and I will be liaising with their editor to ensure that it is not going to go out live.
1,22086,5121,22032,known that a drug using male person, Barry has taken children hostage and is threatening harm to th echildren. He is at times angry, emotional, excited, incoherent and finally made a demand for Sky news to attend at the school with a one hour deadline.<br />i want to achieve the safe resolution of the incident with no loss of life and no injuries to any party<br />i will call sky to the school<br />it will placate Barry to agree to this request<br />it is going to happen anyway<br />it will assist in building a relationship with him - negotiators<br />it will give me more visibility on what is happening<br />unless;<br />he starts to harm the children/staff now
1,22087,5128,22032,at the moment we hvae a male that is vulnerbale and with a background of violence with a firearm in a school. i want to achive safe resoltuion of incident with welafer of children first and foremost as well as welfare of Aitkin. What is currently not known is whether there are ay other accomplicaes on scence (no evidence to suggest there are) and whether fioreamr is loaded / legimiate. My decision is to tell him that we are working getting Skynews there but cannot guarentee and hour. Alongside this I wissh to deploy negotiators to scene to assist in this dailogue. I am going to ask him what esle he needs and to reinforece the idea that we can come to a safe solution. The reason my decision wil achive safe resoltuion byu leeting Skyn News in is that his principle aim seem to be an outlet to express his concerns over his treatment and the tretament of colleagues and so doing allows him a &#039;a voice&#039; and to be heard. It also enables me to gain that prcious hour that is required to gather further intell, slow things down and find safe resoltuion. I would need to seek consulation on whether Sky is achiveabel in an hour and I would want a close liasioon between media and a spokesperosn (forerwalled) from the team<br />Im sticking with that unless other idications mean that he is going to committ violence in the interm (and can therefore withdarw it (ie Sky News) as a negotiation point.
1,22088,5120,22032,a male person is holding a classroom of school children hostage. It is believed that he has a gun and it is belivied that he has mental health issues. He has asked for sky news to attend at the school and has threatened to start shooting in one hour if sky news do not attend.<br />what i want to achieve is a peaceful outcome with all the hostages released without harm and the safe arrest of the hostage taker.<br />my decision is to allow sky news to attend and the hostage taker to talk to them<br />the reason for this is that he has threatened to shoot the hostages if sky do not attend<br />i will alter my decision if any of the hostages suffer harm whilst we are waiting for sky to attend.
1,22089,5121,22072,safe resolution with no harm to any person<br />sky not to attend<br />it puts Barry in control and therefore increases his power base, potentially in his mind giving him the right to make life and death choices<br />unless;<br />he starts to release children now as a bargaining tool
1,22090,5121,22073,call sky news to attend
1,22091,5123,22032,Male has hostages held at school, is in high emotional state and believe to be armed. Unknown number of hostages that include a teacher and 8 year old children.<br />I want to achieve the safe release of all hostages with the minimum amount of risk to them being harmed. I also want to maximise the safety of police officers and other emergency services in attendance and the public.<br />My decison is allow sky news to attend.<br />The reason is if they do not attend the Atkins has threatened to shoot the hostages starting in one hour.<br />The reason for my decison will achive the safe conclusion is that Atkins will start releasing hostages once he has spoken on Sky News.<br />I am sticking with this unless 1) Atkins changes his demands. 2) Hostages are harmed before this takes place. 3) Sky News refuse to give him air time 4) The safety of the news team is in doubt.
1,22092,5126,22032,male has taken control of a class of 8 year old and is threatening to start shooting people unless sky news dont turn up. he is aggitated and known to be a drug user with autisim. cjilderen have failed to be picked up by parents and witnesses id male pulling head teacher into the same class. member of combat 18 and makes reference to muslims. the scholl is now directly for muslim children<br />achieve safe conclusion to circs. safety of the public specifically the children in the class and the headteacher. minimise the risk to officers and the subject.<br />decision yes<br />achieve a time delay and opportunity to start negotiations.<br />reason<br />sky may also provide line of communication and additional intel. control can be tried with sky later. build rappor and calme subject down. buys extra planning time and avoids direct conflict at this early stage.<br />unless<br />shots are heard<br />children and head teacher released<br />surrender<br />sky turn up uninvited<br />loss of comms with subject
1,22093,5124,22031,Prevailing circs - hostages taken by a subject who is beleived known - phone call of intetn, area of contention and demand or will shoot hostages.<br />Sky news to attend the scene - Yes<br />What I want to achieve - preserve life, negotiate resolution, gain time to manage incident effectively, gather resources to deal effectively with incident, gather intel/info, manage press and media flow of information, prevent attempted intrusion into cordon area.<br />Decision is to allow Sky News in<br />Reason is due to time limt to kill hostages (buy time), manage press intrusion and information flow that may escalate situation, build rapport wiht subject, create opportunity for subject to believe his voice has been heard and diffuse high level of anxiety.<br />I&#039;m sticking wiht that unless - escalation of the scene, unable to effectively manage the interaction with the press (safety), need for dynamic entry to save life, no co-operation from media and disposition of subject.
1,22094,5128,22072,I am not going to allow Sky News in. What I want to achieve is the setting of reasoable and proportionate parametres for negotation and to dsaloow escaltion of a onger term problme (being seen to allow a vocie for racist ideology). Therefore I will tell him that this is not feasible at this time (preferbaly through a professional negotaior). I am going to try and get the negotiator to negotatie other more reaosnble and proportionate &#039;rewards&#039; that do not include the expression of a racist ideology. The reason my decision wil achive this is that i might reassert control over the negotiation through a clear realtionship between the team and AItkin
1,22095,5121,22090,because it is goign to happen anyway and by being seen to call them in for Barry it starts to build a relationship that can be exploited by negotiation.
1,22096,5120,22032,what i want to achieve is a peaceful outcome with all the hostages released without harm, and the safe arrest of the hostage taker.<br />my decision is not to allow sky news to attend.<br />the reason for this is that the presence of the news may ignite the situation and i have no guarantee that the hostage taker will not start shooting the hostages on national television. also access the media can be used as a bargaining tool to secure the release of the hostages<br />i will alter my decision if he starts to harm the hostages
1,22097,5128,22073,I AM going to allow Sky News in. Although he may give expression to &#039;his voice&#039; through the media (a) there is no reaosn to belive that this wil do anything other than demonsrate how disturbed he is and how unlcear thinking he is and (b) wil give validation to the notion that we ar ein aposition to negotatiet and seek resoltuion (vis a vis protectiopn of the children). The aim of secruing the safety iof the children by being seen to &#039;yield&#039; toa  request for publicity is a worthwhile trade off. I wold have to bear in mind th epotential ofr porpogating the view that this may lead to otjers adopting a asimilar apporahc to voice greivances but I do not belive there is any evidence that this is either effective nor likley as a repeat set of circumstances. Moreover even if it were likley to encolurage other frionge groups the immediaet risk to children in this classroom here and now has to be prioritised over a possible future (but unlikley) scneario nthe the future.
1,22098,5127,22031,Whilst cognisant of the demand and associated threats coupled with my duty to protect those within the school and secure their release without injury, I am not allowing Sky News to attend the scene at this time.<br />The views of the hostage takers are extreme and are likely to incite racial hatred which could escalate community tensions here and around the UK if sent out live by Sky news. It may also encourage copycat hostage taking around the UK.<br />My decision is alss influenced by the fact that I have a sniper and SFO team who are at Stand-to and ready to take decisive action should the threat to start shooting become more apparent.<br />I understand the impact on the children in terms of what they may witness, but I cannot discount the fact that the hostage taker may still cause harm in full view of Sky news cameras to make his point.<br />I will review this decision should it be made clear that the option to take decisive action is no longer viable.
1,22099,5126,22072,achieve<br />control of negotiations<br />decision no<br />reason<br />minimise public response and extra persons turning up<br />not to put the male into a position of authority<br />minimise news and panic. delay negotiations until trained persons turn up.<br />no others motivated to join in the behaviour<br />unless<br />shots are heard and comms link to no show of sky<br />sky turn up uninvited<br />intel indicates imminent danger to children due to lack of sky<br />actual decision is yes. reason is they will turn up anyway
1,22100,5120,22072,what i want to achieve is a peaceful outcome with all the hostages released without harm, and the safe arrest of the hostage taker.<br />my decision is not to allow sky news to attend.<br />the reason for this is that the presence of the news may ignite the situation and i have no guarantee that the hostage taker will not start shooting the hostages on national television. also access the media can be used as a bargaining tool to secure the release of the hostages<br />i will alter my decision if he starts to harm the hostages

1,22102,5125,22032,Known: Man holding number of schoolchildren and head teacher hostage<br />making demand for sky news to attend within hour or will start to harm hostages<br />muslim secular school - recent change<br />some community concern at this<br />Not: known:<br />identity of man not confirmed. Believed  to be Aitken who has conviction relating to C18 activity.<br />Motivation - assumtion from the phone call thst this is racially motivated. Son believed previously at ths school but not known why left<br />Armed / Unarmed: not known. Assumption is weapon dur to threats but not confirmed<br />EMD - if Aitkin, then he is drug user and aspergers sufferer<br />Time constraint - 1 hour before threat to harm hostages.<br />Overarcjhing aim : what I want to achieve is a safe release of the hostages and safe arrest of suspect<br />My decision is to allow Sky news to attend the scene as requested.<br />The reason my decision will achieve this is that :<br />1. This is the first demand from the suspect. Acceeding to this request at this stage may help to determine motivation, suspects aims, and other helpful information.<br />2. This will provide further time in which gather further information for the tactical plan.<br />3. Reduce risk of harm of to hostages. On information provided at present, the threat is time-bonded and provision of access to this demand will reduce immediate risk.<br />4. Provide an opportunity for potential line  communication with the suspect<br />I am sticking with this decision unless:<br />1. The situation or intelligence picture changes to indicate immediate risk of harm to hostages.<br />2. any indication that the subject may be using the media to facilitate plan to harm hostages<br />3. Serious injury to any of the hostages.<br />4. Confirmation of firearm received.
1,22103,5124,22072,Decision 2 - sky to attend - No<br />Prevailing circs - hostages taken by a subject who is beleived known (EMD) phone call of intent made, area of contention/dissatisfaction identified to us, demand made for press attendacne or will shoot hostages.<br />what I want to achieve - preserve life, negotiate resolution, gain time to manage incident effectively, gather resources to deal effectively with incident, gather intel/info, manage press and media flow of information, prevent attempted intrusion into cordon area, prevent harm to public or other parties<br />decision is to not allow the press to attend<br />my reasons for this are - it may place additional people  uneccessarily in harms way, it may prove a point of progression for the subject i.e. said his message then kills the hostages, may further aggrevate the subject as his anger gains further momentun - subject may become frustrated and put threat into action.<br />I&#039;m sticking with this unless there is an escalation of circs in room, need to create a delay in time, need to get access to the room , need to manage media output.
1,22104,5124,22073,Sky to be asked to attend and to agree process and purpose. negotiation team to brief them.
1,22105,5125,22032,I want to achieve the safe recovery of the hostages and the arrest of the suspect<br />My decision is not to allow sky news to attend.<br />My reason why this will achieve my objective is:<br />1. The reason for request for attendance is not clear. This may be part of the suspects plan to publicise harm to hostages.<br />2. Media attendance may impact on control and command of the incident adversley
1,22106,5127,22072,FINAL DECISION-<br />My overarching aim is to secure the safe release of the children and teacher (s). As such, I will, in Principal, allow Sky News to attend should they agree.  That said , I have a duty to them and will need explore the conditions set by the hostage taker. This will include whether he wants to see it live on TV or whether we can pre-record.
1,22107,5131,22072,Sky to attend  - No<br />No change in prevailing circumstances<br />I want to achieve a peacful outcome with the safe release of all hostages and the safe arrset of the offende, secure and preserve evidence for a succesful prosecution.<br />Allows Atkins to take control and inflame situation.<br />raises concern of families of hostages<br />As he becomes agitated raises risk to hostages
1,22108,5131,22073,Not to allow Sky to atend
1,22109,5128,22074,There is a person known to BA who has successful helped us with a previous incident and has track record for calming him down. She &#039;may&#039; be in a idfferent state now as she was previously (iunt the successful incident) &#039;clean&#039; . Morevover we do not yet know what circs (if any) have changed in BAs sitation (or between him and her). I want to achivea a dialogue between BA and CD to try and calm the sitatuion adn my reason for using her is that she has track record and a previosu relaitonhsip with him that sufgests this was an effective &#039;balm&#039; in the past. It is also unkonw how he responds to us or the negoatior so here we have a known (or at least better known) quantity. Im srticking with that unless subsequent intell suggests she is in a less robust sitatuion than before) and / or initial indicatiosn are (around delpoying her) are that the dailogue braks down.
1,22110,5126,22074,circs<br />charlotte subjects girlfriend is avaiable and known to have a positive impact on he subjects behaviour this is verified by intel from officer involved in a previous arrest<br />charlotte is known to use drugs.<br />achieve<br />calming down and rationalisation of subject to minimise risk to children and headteacher<br />decision yes<br />reason<br />positive known impact and a volunteer. subject has not made threats towards charlotte and is defined towards muslims<br />unless<br />subject makes threats towards charlotte<br />shooting starts<br />surrender
1,22111,5120,22074,charolotte dennision has arrived at the scene and stated that she can calm him down. she has previously been successful in doing so when he was arrested. information now is that charolotte is now back on crack cocaine<br />i want to achiev the safe release of the hostages and safe arrest of the hostage taker<br />my decision is to use charlotte as an intermediary<br />the reason is that she has knowledge of barry and is a familiar voice and has managed to calm him sown previously.<br />i will change my decision if charolotte is not in a fit state to communicate with barry or is likely to inflame the sitation
1,22112,5121,22074,charlotte, girlfriend of subject has offered to assist in the negotiation and believes that she can talk subject down. local officer confirms that she has done so previously when subject was arrested and he is a different person after talking to her. however, she was clean of crack cocaine for 12 months prior to the last &#039;negotiation&#039; and has been using now for the last 3 months. she sounded emotional on the phone whilst making the offer.<br />i want to achieve - the same safe resolution to the incident, with no harm to any persons involved<br />i will allow charlotte to talk to subject<br />she has been able to talk subject down in the past<br />he is likely to trust her more quickly than the time it will take to build a relationship by a negotiator<br />he is more likely to listen to her requests than that of a police officer<br />unless; she attends wacked up on scooby juice
1,22113,5127,22072,Yes.<br />My overarching aim is to secure the safe release of the children and teacher(s), so I will allow CD to act as a TPI.<br />There are clear risk due to her habit, albeit these are weighted against the calming influence she will most likely have over the hostake taker.<br />The aim will be to check with the H.T that he will speak with her and for her to be briefed by the H.N (in the O.C) in terms of what to say and when and failure to cooperate will lead me to review that decision.<br />Shoudl it become apparent that her involvement is inflaming the situation, then she will be withdrawn and I will review my decision and continencies dependant upon a DRA.
1,22114,5124,22074,Decsion 2 - Yes<br />Girlfreind is offering to act as a mediatior with the subject and this has been very effective in the past.  info is that she has recently staqrted to use crack cocaine again within the last few weeks.<br />What I want to achieve is the preservation of life, negotiate resolution, gain time to manage the incident out.<br />Decision is to allow girlfriend as a third party intermediary.<br />The reason for this is that she has a rapport with the subject, we can partly control her interaction through the negotiators and briefing, we can manage the information flow to Charlotte, it is believed that this will enhance the communication process with the subject, Charlotte&#039;s capabilities can be assessed and managed in respect of teh level of interaction.<br />i&#039;m sticking wiht this decision unless Charlote becoems unstablse or irrational, she refuses to comply with rules and a direction given, the subject refuses to speak to her or reacts in a negative manner to the communication
1,22115,5128,22075,I am not going to use her. I want to achieve a safe resltion ot the incident but do not belive using her is the way forward. Instead I would seek to use her in the background to assist me in inforaming the NC and his / her intell and apporahces that she has use din the past. The The reason my decision wil achive safe resoltuion is that in using her we have less control and capcity to guide and reframe and ther is a risk (again unknown) that in using her (in a differtent state than she prevsiously was with a different context and circs) that she may prvoke or at least not be in a position to successfuly manage him. That would then mean we would need to pull back and start shuttign that dialogue down which may lead to further risk and uncertrainty. Advisor yes, TPI no. Im stricking with that unless he specifically asks to speak with her directly (whcih as yet he has not).
1,22116,5125,22074,The overarching startegic aim remains the same.<br />The decision is to use Aitkins girlfriend Charlotte Dennison as an intermediary 3rd part to assist in communicating with him.<br />The reason my decision will achieve this is:<br />1. Intelligence from a Police source indicates that Dennison was successfully used in a previous incident with teh Police to communicate and calm down Aitkins<br />2. Dennison appears to understand the suspect and his medical condition. A familiar an trusted TPI will be a valuable part of the negotiation and communication strategy and can help to bring the situation to a speedier resolution safely.<br />3. Using Dennison allows control over her communication to Aitkins in a structured manner that will support the negotiation tactics.<br />I am maintaining this decision unless:<br />1. Intelligence comes to light which indicates that Dennison is part of the planned criminality.<br />2.. The presence of dennison starts to cause a greater degree of anxiety to the suspect<br />3. The negotiaition coodinator advises that the use of Dennison will adversely impact upon the successful negotiaition and communication startegy
1,22117,5128,22076,I am not going to use CD. On balance there are too many unknowns and too much risk associaetd with using her ot only then potentially retratc her. further, it is not a demand he has request ed and so not one that we need to accede to at this point...
1,22118,5120,22075,i want to achieve the safe release of the hostages and safe arrest of the hostage taker<br />my decision is not to use charolotte as an intermediary<br />the reason is that charolotte is now back on the crack cocain and may be unstable and likely to inflame the situation. also the is evidence to show that the use of internediaries does not usually result in a satisfactory outcome.<br />i will change my decision if barry asks to speak to her and she is in a fit state to converse with him.
1,22119,5121,22075,achieve? - safe resolution with subject surrendering to police and no harm to anybody<br />decision - refusal to allow Charlotte to talk to subject<br />reason decision will achieve - charlotte is emotional and using crack cocaine. possibility that she will not be able ot put forward a coherent argument for subject to surrender<br />it may be that charlotte is aware of the subjects rationale for th eincident (hate crime) and has sympathy for his views and will encourage acts of violence<br />by seeking a peacful resolution with no harm to anyone this tactic could place charlotte in harms way<br />unless;<br />negotiation by police not working and threats to commit violence escalate
1,22120,5126,22075,achieve<br />maintain sterile comms with subject to maximise negotiation opportunity<br />decision no<br />reason<br />no control over charlotte and information given<br />other lines of negotiation to be established first by trained staff<br />drug affiliation<br />potential extra hostage<br />subject does not know charlotte is avaiable yet<br />unless<br />charlottes presence is known and danger increased due to subjects behaviour in response.<br />negotion fails and the risks are increased due to subjects increased agittated state
1,22121,5131,22074,Circs - Charlotte is partner of Atkins, she has been used succesfully before when Atkins was arested and managed to calm him down. Atkins has previous Cocaine use but believed to be clean for a year. Charlotte has contacted teh police, is aware of  the situation and wants to help.<br />What I want to achieve is as before with teh additional safety of Charlotte to consider and not to place her in any danger. I want to use Charlotte as an intemidiary to bring teh situation to a succesful conclusion and to safely secure the hostages release and arrest atkins.<br />My decison is allow her to be used<br />The reason is that the overidding principle is teh right to life of the hostages and Atkins. By using Charlotte she will be able to calm down Atkin, she knows his problems and has been used effectivley before to calm him down when arrested. By using her to calm down Atkins there will be a minimisation of threat and risk to teh hostages, Atkins will calm down and teh safe release of eth hostages can be effectivley negotiated.<br />Sticking with this unless there is a change in the behaviour of Atkins in terms of him calmimg down, hostages are released or he makes a seperate demand that can be considered.
1,22122,5127,22106,NO -<br />My strategic aim is to secure the safe release of the Children and Teacher(s) and as such I will not allow C to act as a TPI.<br />She has a drug habit and due to the drug being used her behaviour will be unpredicatable and she may well in-flame the situation. I am also unsure as to wheteher his views are shared by her.
1,22123,5126,22076,not use - no additional risk due to the offer and can be used as a contingency later
1,22124,5127,22076,Final Decision<br />I will allow officers to speak with C.D and assess her suitability to act as a TPI. If the assessment is positive then I will allow her to liaise with the H.N so that she can be briefed as to what she can and cannot say.<br />There is a riks with doing this, but there are potential benefits in her being able to calm the situation and seek his cooperation in terms of releasing some or all of the children or indeed convincing him to give himself up as he has already made his point.
1,22125,5124,22075,Decision Point 2 - No<br />Girlfriend is offering to act as a third party intermediary. there is a need to communicate with the subject and negortiate a resolution and safe release of the hostages.<br />My decision is not to allow Charlotte to act as a third party intermidiatory.<br />The reasons for this are Charlotte is a crack cocaine user and is unstable, this interaction may escalate the anxiety of the subject,. Her interaction cannot be controlled and she can be erratic in conversation.<br />at present the situation is controlle dand negotiations are possible.<br />I am sticking with this unless the conditionas and anxiety level with the subject change oir if negotiations break down wiht the subject.
1,22126,5131,22075,Not to allow Charlotte<br />Not going to use her, her presence at eth scene could inflame the situationa nd have an adverse effect on teh actions of an already dangerous man who is irrational. I want a safe resolotion.<br />No control over what she says or what she will do.
1,22127,5125,22075,The overarching strategic aim remains the same.<br />The decision is not to use Dennison as a TPI.<br />My rationale for this decision achieving the strategic aim is:<br />1. The current relationship between Dennison and Aitkin is not known. A domestic disagreement may be the reason for hios activity today<br />2. Dennison has a prevcious history of drug abuse. There is no indication that she is not drug dependent at present which would impact on the successful negotiation with Aitkin.<br />3. The situation in which Dennison was previously used was entirely different to the current scenario where lives are at risk. The use of an unknown TPI could increase the risk.
1,22128,5121,22076,use charlotte if following assessment she is coherent and able to assist. she presents a known and worked before solution to resolve incidents involving subject
1,22129,5124,22076,Final decsisioon 2: I will ask the negotiation team to assess CD and if CD is stable enough to engage and bring value to the negotiationas in hand I will allow CD to make contact, etc.
1,22130,5125,22075,Decision is to allow Sky news to attend but communication with the suspect will only be with the authority of the incident Commander
1,22131,5125,22075,Decision: I will allow CD to attend the scene and communication will only be with the authority of the Incident Commander and in line with the negotiation strategy
1,22132,5131,22076,I will allow her to be used as an advisor but not in direct negotiation
1,22133,5120,22076,i am not going to allow charolotte to act as an intedrmedairy<br />the reason is that she is potentially unstable and at this time i am not aware of the current relationship between them, therefore if i used her it may not lead to the safe release of the hostages.

1,22192,5146,22137,Objective - safely resolve the situation with safe recovery of the children and teacher<br />Safe recovery of Barry aitkin<br />Safety of Police and public
1,22193,5143,22137,Landscape<br />Hostage situation at school (K)<br />8 year old kids held hostage (k)<br />etc<br />Goal - To minimise risk to hostages<br />Minimise risk to staff at school and non-hostage schoolchildren<br />To Minimise risk to MOP in vicinity<br />Maximise safety of officers - armed and unarmed<br />Minimise risk to subject
1,22194,5142,22136,Yes<br />Goal -The safety of the children and the Deputy Head is of paramount importance and is the overall startegic objective
1,22195,5145,22136,I am aware that he entred the school at approximately 309pm and is known to have led the headmistress to the classroom by force. I was notified of the incident at approximately 4.30pm At 5.30pm the suspect has made telephone contcat to indicate that he wishes to speak with Sky news within the hour or he will start shooting children.
1,22196,5139,22137,My decision is not to let him speak to Sky News at this time:<br />The reason my decsion will achieve the goal is that:<br />1. It may prompt male to act as a martyr.<br />2. It may further agitate the subject.<br />3. I do not have avaialble resources to safely implement this request at this time<br />4. It will distract the subject form having dialogue with us
1,22197,5138,22136,A - Will not allow him to speak to Sky at this time
1,22198,5141,22136,Information as per the scenario that that male has entered Oakwood School believed to have taken the head teacher hostage abd entered Class 4Y containing pupils. K A call has been recieved from the subject believed to be Barry Atkin 33years, intel Combat 18, EMD making comments against Muslims&gt; His request is for Sky News to attend so that he can speak with them or he will start shooting children but may releasae some.K
1,22199,5142,22136,The hostage taker has made a demand and reinforced this demand, threatening to shoot children if the demand to speak with Sky news is not facilitated
1,22200,5146,22137,Action -<br />I have decided I will not allow Barry Aitkin to speak to sky news at this time.<br />I&#039;m going to negotiate with Barry to secure the safe release.
1,22201,5145,22136,Goal:- My goal is to preserve life and ensure that this siege situation is brought to a successful conclusion without loss of life or injury to any persons. Giving die consideration to the request of the suspect I have to consider if his demands are appropriate.
1,22202,5138,22136,Rational - it may put the hostages at greater risk by allowing him a media to have a public execution.<br />Rational - I want negotiation leverage
1,22203,5141,22136,Unknown at this time is at to why this is happening; numbers of pupils; intel on Atkin and associates. Resoucre levels are not known and the time is now 5.30pm.Clearly offences have been commited&gt;
1,22204,5139,22137,5. May prompt subject to harm the children whilst on air<br />6. May cause copycat incidents / additional prob,lems with scene management if people see the news and attend the scene.
1,22205,5138,22136,A - further actions - negotiator to buy me some time and build rapport with subject.<br />A - inteeligence package on believed offender ( however the identity needs to be firmed up)
1,22206,5142,22136,The reason and rational behind this decision is;<br />This approach complies with the goals of this operation.<br />The subject will be given the opportunity to speak with Sky news.<br />If the subject is not given access to Sky news there is an honest belief he may start shooting his hostages i.e the children
1,22207,5137,22136,A - Arrange for Sky news to attend. R -This is at this time a contingency. I will have them make their way to the scene. I Will also inform other news agencies. The reason for me taking this decision is that they will find out anyway and will attend in due course if not already on the way. I know that they will send 3 response crews. 1 to the scene, 1 to the command point or Police HQ and 1 to the hospital. If I later take a decision  for him to speak with them (highy unlikey)(in the hour demanded) I can be sure they are here.
1,22208,5146,22137,Reason -<br />I wish to retain some control of the incident to improve the likelyhood of a successful outcome.<br />I cannot control all variables and may have to use decisive Force or entry to secure my objectives<br />I don&#039;t wish to allow the opportunity for public exection or encourage copy cat incidents
1,22209,5140,22137,Reason: The subject of this incident has telephoned the police and has given a highly aggressive account of how he feels that muslim people are being specially treated. He is clearly (based on the call recorded into the police) extremely passionate about his cause and wants the world to know about it. He has made this demand and it is my view that if we give in to this demand at this stage then it is unlikely to result in the incident being resolved.
1,22210,5143,22137,Action -<br />I have decided that subject cannot speak to Sky news at this stage.<br />Reason -<br />Negotiations ongoing as per tactical plan. This is in a controlled and planned basis undertaken by Negotiation Cell.<br />Dynamic -<br />I will continue with my decision
1,22211,5139,22137,I am sticking to that unless:<br />1. Male makes his own contact with Sky news
1,22212,5144,22137,Action<br />Just in relation to the question around allowing atendence of sky news -<br />I have decided not to allow attendence of sky news<br />Reason  as this wil give the subject an audience and raise tension<br />as yet I have no negotiator advice  which is being sought<br />The allowing of such an audience will not significantly mitigate the risk to those at risk<br />The action that is being taken in line with the SFC strategy is...........<br />The tactical parameter are ........
1,22213,5145,22136,Action:- I will facilitate the subject access to a Sky News reporter under strict conditions. I am aware in his conversation that he was showing signs of distress. This is a critical stage and this access is appropriate
1,22214,5140,22137,This is not going to be the solution to his grieveance and will not acheive the strategy but rather will reinforce his position ofd strength and likely to result id further and greater demands.
1,22215,5141,22136,Goal Save Life;Maximise safety of the occupants of the school; Minimise rishk to police officers;Maintain cordons;Develop intelligence; Develop CIA; Media Strategy; return to normality - public confidence. Tactical Parameters - No oficers to enter premises unless consultation with SFC
1,22216,5141,22136,Action: igation.end to be placed on standby as this may assit investI have decided that Sky News att
1,22217,5145,22136,Reason:- Appropriate as a means of negotiating
1,22218,5141,22140,Landscape - Dennison has asked that Police use her as a 3rd party.K It is unknown how credible her interaction would be and that this could put her in danger and inflame the situation.
1,22219,5137,22139,G - my goal remains the same.<br />A - have trained negotiator speak with Charlotte to assess her as a TPI. this is in line with natioanal guidance and its important for me to understand her capabilty and for me to take an informed decision.
1,22220,5138,22139,My goals remain the same - safe release of hostages being primary objective.
1,22221,5141,22140,Goal As previous entry overarching save life
1,22222,5145,22139,Goal:- Me goal remain the same. To facilitate the safe return of the children to their families without injury of loss of life using tactical options available to me at the time.
1,22223,5140,22140,Goal: As stated previously.<br />Action: I do not intend to use the girlfriend as a TPI.<br />Reason: Whilst the use of third party intermediaries is a tactic used by trained negotiators it is a notoriously difficult tactic. The girlfriend has previously been used successfully in this way but that was when she was clean of drugs.
1,22224,5146,22139,Aitkin is Aspergers F  Condition has significant communication issues F Girlfriend has previous evience of helpful interaction F Girlfriend may now be taking cocaine Ass - Sounded cohesive on phone ass
1,22225,5146,22139,Goal/Objective - Not changed
1,22226,5141,22140,Action Continue with previous actions however Dennison is not to be used as a 3rd party.
1,22227,5142,22139,The goal remains the same<br />Action We will allow her to speak with him under controlled circumstances, she will notr be allowed to enter the school<br />Reason is that she hasp reviously had a calming influence on him and succesfully intervened. He is agitated and it is desirable to calm him down. He is a VP and communication with him is vital, this is hindered by his agitated state.
1,22228,5139,22139,What I want to acheive is;<br />1. Safety of children /school staff<br />2. Public safety<br />3. Max safety of officer sinvolved<br />4. Min risk to subject<br />Action: I will allow girlfirend to speak to him (by phone but not physically meet).<br />The reason my decsion will achieve the goals are:<br />1. She has previously assited Police in de-escalating a volatile situation<br />2. Aitkins is very agitated and hostile towards the Police<br />3. She apprears to ber lucid and coherent on the phone despite inteeligence that she has recently been using drugs. She may also possibly be able to give information on his drugs usage
1,22229,5137,22139,Dynamic - she is credible and can offer assistance - yes have her talk to him. Assessed as no - it doesn&#039;t happen.
1,22230,5145,22139,Action:- I am aware that the girlfriend of the suspect has successfuly negotiated with him in the past during a police incident. This option is available to me now and will use her under strict conditions and working alongside the negotiator.
1,22231,5140,22140,I am concerned, at this stage, that this is too unpredictable a tactic to use bearing in mind that we are already some time into the incident and nobody has been hurt. The longer that the incident goes on the more change of a successful concluision.
1,22232,5146,22139,Action-<br />I have decided to allow Aitkin to talk to his girlfriend<br />I am going to facilitate this in a controled manner with briefing and debriefing for her
1,22233,5137,22139,I will at this time go with the assumption as YES.
1,22234,5137,22139,R - She has helped in the past and it will help achieve my goal
1,22235,5146,22139,Reason - This will offer the best chance of calming Aitkin to allow a peaceful resolution to achieve my goals
1,22236,5142,22139,Effective communication via TPI will assist in resolving the incident and achieving our goals.<br />I am sticking with this unless I receive an immiedate threat to life within the buildng in which case I will authorise firearms contigencies
1,22237,5139,22139,I am sticking with this decision unless:<br />1. The girlfriend appears to be under the influence of drugs<br />2. Her intervention appears to make Aitkins more agitated /he is refusing to speak to her<br />3. Girlfreind refuses to co-operate with the Police and converse with him along agreed guidleines
1,22238,5144,22140,landscape<br />info recieved from Charlotte that she could assist by speakng wih him<br />info from PC that at a demo the use of Charlotte as an TPI was positive<br />Goal as per previous<br />Action<br />Not to allow to speak<br />Reason<br />Goals remain the same, the is unsufficient background to support use of TPI this could spark further agitation there is no control over his once once started<br />the previous example of positive use as a TPI was in a very different scenarion<br />The SFC and strat remains the same<br />The use of he TPI wil not work significantly towards this<br />The use of a qualified and exp negotiator to make communication is the better option<br />dynamic<br />if new nfo comes to light this will be reviewed<br />if all hostages are safely released his will be reviewed
1,22239,5141,22140,Reason - The mental state of Dennison is unknown and her prescence could put her life in danger.At this time she. may inflame the situation and make the situation worse. The subject has not requested to speak with her and her.
1,22240,5146,22139,Dynamic -<br />Unless Charlotte is exhibiting drug related behaviour or is viewed as a sig risk after briefing
1,22241,5145,22139,Reason:- Information has been received that the tactical option of using the girlfriend in the negotation stage has previously been a success. Whilst there is current intelligence indicating that she is currently taking controlled drugs I have no information or intelligence to suggest that she is not suitable under strict guidelines to perform the role.
1,22242,5141,22140,Dynamic - Review intelligence on Dennison - gleam further information and keep her as an intelligence source and liaise with Neg as to possible use.
1,22243,5140,22140,Dynamic: It would consider changing this tactic if negotiations would deteriorate to such a state that using a TPI was considered a risk worth considering.
1,22244,5146,22139,Alternative<br />Use of sniper if no other option available and risk increases
1,22245,5138,22139,Aitken has asperges and trusts his girlfriend and whilst she has returned to the use of drugs and prevents a risk, she has shown a desire to assist, is coherent and what she says is backed up by officers.<br />A - liaise with hostage negotiator to ascertain what the rapport situation is and use of tpi.<br />A - use Carlotte as TPI with our control of comms e.g by phone.<br />Continue to develop firearms plan - to enable immediate acttion if required.<br />Rational -
1,22246,5145,22139,Dynamics:- I will stick to this tactic unless there is intelligence or information to indicate that this tactic will not serve the best interest of the victime.
1,22247,5143,22140,Goal - same as previous<br />Decision - Not to allow Charlette to speak to subject.<br />The reason for my decision is that:<br />1/. I am currently worked to a planned and agreed negotiation plan.<br />2/. I have considered the new intelligence that girlfriend, Charlotte has previously had a calming affecton Aitken. i am aware though that these circs were very different to now, ie, it was for a relatvely minor offence, it was whilst he was under arrest and he was not armed.<br />Aitken is not constrined, he is suspected of being armed and is making lethal threats. By exposing Charlotte to such a situtaion would place her at risk an not achieve my strategy.<br />Phone contact can not be controlled as Charlotte&#039;s presence may provoke violent action.
1,22248,5145,22139,Alt:- Negotiator only
