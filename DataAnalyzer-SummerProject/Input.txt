The MPS need to provide a press bulletin for release to Boroughs<br />with even the most limited factual information within 60 minutes of an incident. Otherwise the 24 hour news channels will deliver their interpretation of the in incident and possibly damage community confidence.

'0','0','The one size fits all approach to the Thursday 21st rail station operation was inappropriate and caused some raised fears in our communities. At some of the quieter stations the sight of a seven police officers caused some commuters to turn right around and go home as they thought a major incident had occurred. BOCUs should be left to make local operational decisons. If we had been told exactly what the purpose of the operation was we could have planned tactics to deliver it.'

Formal Q&amp;A session with local community members - with positive outcomes.<br />(2) 22nd July - Visit by female officers and staff (with interpreter) to Islamic Centre for Workshop with Moslem women. Once again
'0','0','There has been real concern about the duplication of effort in relation to deploying resources in central london. even some time after the incidents the coordination between central london BOCUs and CO11 has not been evident. Control  of resources should have a central focus.'
'0','0','The advent of 24 hour news channels and live interviews requires a different response from police. There needs to be a Police spokesperson accessing live broadcasts facilities even when full facts are not known. This will increase the risk of making a mistake by responding to current available information but allows access to a very wide population where even standard police appeals

'0','0','There is little doubt that the general public have understood and supported what the MPS have and are trying to achieve. Many Boroughs have established mechanisms in place for responding when community contact and interaction is required. I do however believe that we must review the basis upon which IAG&#039;s assist. My feeling is that we should lok to establish a body beyond their remit which will include all stakeholders and in particular Local Authorities.'
'0','0','Our local cross faith support to the wider Muslim community has been very positive. Most residents recognise the extremists involved do not represent the Muslim majority in any way.

This allowed early consultation and involvement of the trustees on the police response and support to them. They are actively involved in any decision making and as a result community confidence and reassurance levels are high.  Corporate community tension indicators informed the Borough of the wider picture allowing us to determine local needs.<br />A good faith prayer meeting was planned outside the Mosque which we assisted in enabling to take place at the Town Hall

'0','0','In most major incidents within many potential witnesses if details are not obtained promptly we&#039;lose&#039; witnesses who leave the scene. Sometimes they do not realise the importance of what they can add. From watching early media coverage of the events you could see many people leaving the scenes. This coverage can assist to identify people later. A postive step for the MPS could be to get our own cameras there asap and record images of all leaving the scene and potentially their names and addresses. The feasibility is greater for the larger events with most potential witnesses.'

'0','0','Also an issue on our borough. The Muslim community have been encouraged to supply their own security to supplement/support police actions. Significant reluctance in this area
'0','0','Also please look at the other themes'
'0','0','I have been very dissappointed with the information flow. I found that I was trying to second guess what was going on and got most of my information from Sky news - some of which proved to be unreliable e.g eye witnesses categorically saying that the Stockwell shooting wictim was a suicide bomber because they had seen a bomb belt and dangling wires. Appreciating that it was a very fast moving scenario and that any strategic assessment would have been out of date as soon as it was published we do need a system that provides that sort of assessment in a timely way.'
'0','0','The surprise element referred too is totally inappropriate. Information and intelligence are at the heart of all that we should be doing. Not just with these events but all policing. Putting police officers at stations and other transport networks is re-assuring but we can only do that for so long before it becomes recognised as a tactic and its value reduces. Boroughs must have the lead on developing
'0','0','The importance of local knowledge must not be underestimated - or undermined. In general terms
'0','0','Many of the comments have already been included in the remarks of others. The fact that we had a community meeting on the 7th July and a number since has increased confidence. Additionally we are holding seperate meetings with those communities who were not willing to talk in front of others- a meeting with the Muslim leaders and we have held one and another next week for the Somali Community. It has been reassuring that the Somali youth have made contact to hold a meeting. This has been gratefully received as it is one of our hard to reach groups. We have good relations with the elders and less so with the young.<br />Agree that need fast time messages

'0','0','Feedback from officers from this Borough on aid yesterday to central London indicated how much an overkill in relation to deployments
'0','0','The local Muslim community remain pleased with police action overall. They were initially concerned about the level of reassurance that would be provided. ie too much and there would be added concerns from their community that we felt that there was a specific threat to them or that we were suspicious. They wanted to see their own cops from Safer Neighbourhoods or community teams. As far as possible this has been our policy and it has proven very effective.'

This was important so that we didn&#039;t appear to be focusing on and drawing more attention to the Muslim community. It reinforced the Londoners as a whole were the victims message.'
'0','0','what other communities are effected
'0','0','At the initial stages of both incidents it was somewhat disappointing to be updated by Sky then have the same update issued to Boroughs up to an hour later.  Quick time intelligence and requirements must be fed to boroughs in a more efficient manner.'
'0','0','All Faith groups were pleased to receive visits from officers to provide re-assurance and first hand advice and progress reports. Some groups were surprised that they received such visits as they had not expected them and they were something
'0','0','The MPS is a tremendous responder. On my Borough I have taken the decision to move to 12 hour days and therefore protect officers rest days as far as I can within current resourcing requirements. I have always been opposed to anything other than 8 hour tours of duty for many reasons. I think that the MPS must have a shift system that allows it to manage. There are a multitude of patterns about all in the name of flexibility but I am sure that in times of crisis they must be difficult. I think an interesting discussion could be had on availabilty.'

'0','0','One of the key risks for the MPS concerns the ongoing response to priority crime. Op Theseus etc. is inevitably having a significant impact on our capacity to maintain core Borough functions (e.g. proactive crime taskings) - and there is a clear need to keep an eye on &#039;the day job&#039; (not least because of the impact that a significant rise in priority crime will have on community confidence).'

The longer we are required to provide resources on the current scale the more it is likely that we will be unable to recover in certain priority crime areas. In terms of resourcing what contributions are being made by those who work at CO etc. I remember the former Commissioner saying that the centre would also help with aid thereby taking some of the strain of Borough.'

'0','0','The long term abstraction of staff for HVP either on or off teh borough has the potential to seriously impact on already challenging crime reduction and detection targets. Not all stations are in hotspots so the impact that could be gained by the effective deployment of local resources is lost.

'0','0','I agree
'0','0','Staff confidence in decision making one size does not fit all
'0','0','This demand has highlighted to amount of restricted/recoup officers who are unable to provide any credible support to this operation.<br />There needs to be a corporate review of how we allow so many officers to have such an impact on service performance. Too many times OH tie our hands by placing restrictions on officers return to work. The service need should come first followed by individual support where necessary. The current process allows the officer (and some will abuse the system) to lead the decision process.'
'0','0','Are CO11 taking any account of the number of tube stations etc that each Borough has when sending out the Aid requirements? My Borough - whilst relatively small in terms of officer numbers - has a minimum of 14 posts to cover.'

'0','0','Locally
'0','0','The criteria for deployment needs to be flexible for local needs.  Main transport links with large throughput of passengers may have guidance provided in respect of numbers of officers - this is to be determined by number of acces routes etc.  Presumably this may be available through station emergency plans - do MPS have access to these.<br />The later request to provide local reassurance action plans appeared sound

'0','0','The &#039;adhoc&#039; selection of staff from Borough has greatly impacted on the operational efficiency. Whilst always willing to provide any resource requested
'0','0','Is there likely to come a time when the MPS reviews what its day job is. As a result of more attacks the strain across the board would be immense and some of the juggled balls would surely drop or need to be placed to one side for a while.'
'0','0','The limited number of Sec 44 stops usage is a surprise. As the previous comment - Is this lack of knowledge and fear of use
'0','0','In terms of managing stations. Has anyone considered closing as a matter of course those stations that have very little through traffic. It may be something for the networks to consider particularly outside normal commuting times. Less resources standing around providing re-assurance to no-one in particular.'
'0','0','Seems to be little being communicated by the centre to local transport ie. bus companies eg Local bus companies have had little guidance and reassurance from TfL/TOCU'
'0','0','Jonathan. Will this be sent out all BOCUs
'0','0','One of the best ways to keep staff motivated and engaged is to provide them with high quality briefings and a diversity of tasks to perform. Simply standing at the entrance to a Tube Station for more than a day or two can be soul-destroying. I accept that local Boroughs have significant responsibilities for the quality of briefings etc - but we are restricted by the quality of information and taskings being provided Centrally.'
'0','0','I have steered away from 12 hr shifts due to the resilience issues that this will cause me in the long term. I am concerned about the cost of the operation to my local budget and would appreciate an early steer as to where the funds will come from tp pay for this.'
'0','0','The emails have often not been the best way to get information out
'0','0','Please let local Boroughs maintain contact with local communities. It works.'
'0','0','Already mentioned by colleagues but long term high visibility patrols on the scale that we have been undertaking are not sustainable for all boroughs.  Deploying 1+6 to every BR/LT station was considered above and beyond what was really required both internally and externally.  Strategic concept is not in question but allow BOCU&#039;s to manage delivery rather than dictating that deployments are non-negotiable.'
'0','0','Whilst clearly at times of new incident and new intelligence aid requirements will not be known in advance
'0','0','IAG involvement in local gold groups has been invaluabel. Consistent use of the same reps has provided consistency too.'
'0','0','Is it possible that we might wish to consider some sort of Emergency Powers programme for our PCSO&#039;s. In the event of situations like this an authority can be given to increase the powers of PCSO&#039;s for a period of time in support of the general MPS response.'
'0','0','Safer Neighbourhood and SMT presence outside mosque after Friday lunch prayers in  shirtsleeves without hat
'0','0','Everything needs to be intelligence led. We need to be informed of why we are asked to do certain things without the need for any secret intelligence to be disclosed. For example was Thursdays increase in aid due to intelligence re further possible attacks or Anniversary reassurance. We do need to know this.<br />Reflect what others are saying that the overall strategy should be given to Borough and tactics decided by Borough-feeding these tactics back to a central point for quality assurance and feedback. A TP support Unit or team may have been useful to co-ordinate all of this.<br />Can well meaning NSY units not ask for info outside of the central Command structure as this was confusing. Also sending the same message to both Borough Commander
'0','0','WE have just gone to 12 hour shifts to be able to cope with the aid demands and policing of a large number of LTE/BR stations on the borough. Our OPS office are fielding constant complaints. I find this extremely disappointing that some do not apparently recognise disruption to their home lives is necessary at this time. We are trying to keep disruptions to a minimum. Long term our resilience is questionable if we are to avoid burn out of level II

'0','0','Absolutely agree - I know it is the first time it has been used like this

'0','0','We too have used our local authority traffic wardens
'0','0','At present we are trying to keep the cost of aid etc down by utising available staff before resorting to overtime. This may in the longer term have a negative effect on our performance. A number of other boroughs seem to have adopted the policy of not worrying about overtime and utilising more officers from rest day working for pay. The concern about this is that money that is spent will not be re-imbursed
'0','0','The deployment of HVP to transport nodes is a ueseful tactic to prevent/reassure etc. Will CO 11 make it known on what intelligence they used in assigning staffing levels to stations last Thursday as from a Borough perspective the levels at some stations were innappropriate. Was it footfall or specific intelligence?'

Also can&#039;t turn a blind eye to the fact that all communities don&#039;t really know what young people are doing. Raised the importance of engaging with young and disaffected youth to prevent them from becoming targets for recruiters'
'0','0','Inter faith engagement as well as engagement with the Muslim conmmunity has been important - particualrly in the sending out of joint lessages of soolidarity and community cohesion in the face of the attacks'

'0','0','Ensure don&#039;t over react but still remain focused and need to return to normality. Need to respond to intelligence and turn focus to getting best community intel rather than long term High Vis which will lose its impact.<br />Crime Performance will suffer! Using all proactive resources on this'
'0','0','Community briefings are hampered by the lack of clear sanitised material from the centre - we often look silly when we are briefing gold groups and community contactds on less infromation than they are getting from the media - including what police spokespeople are saying - the i nfromation flow needs to be faster time'

'0','0','Core business will be at risk until the end on the AL period (September). I have no proactivity to speak of and response teams are being kept to minimum strenghts. CID staff are on the streets
'0','0','We have been very disappointed with the flow of information from the centre and the command structure. Like others most information has come from Sky news.<br />There has been a tendancy from the centre to micro manage local resources for reassurance without allowing local command structures to deliver on a Gold Strategy taking into account local issues and sizes/locations of stations
'0','0','The Met was slow in getting effective family liaison arrangements in place at hospitals - we need to get this right for the future - early deployment of FLOs is vital
'0','0','We authorised the purchase of freeview boxes for all station TV&#039;s. This allowed for us to keep up with breaking news and kept staff informed.'
'0','0','I agree - there was too much use of multiple channels of communication from differnet central departmerts to different people/units on boroughs - we need earlier clarity about who is responsuible for what and a communication channel that everyone uses - e-mails to borough commanders
'0','0','Having been working non-stop since 7/7 I am going on leave between Wed and Friday
'0','0','Its has already been said above.  Please please please trust boroughs to deploy appropriately.  As a Borough Commander I like to believe I am employed for my judgement not obedience.  The dictates coming from the centre have treated boroughs like children.'
'0','0','Community issues were particularly confusing - who in the early stages was Bx community for London needs to be clearer and the number of returns needed earlier rationalisation - demands for three hourly updates were ridiculous'
'0','0','I accept we have to follow directions on intelligence led operations in whcih we are not all included in the intelligence picture - what is needed in these cases are better briefings - eg if prevention rather than reassurance is the message and the tactics are based on delivering that then this needs to be reflected in the briefings we give staff'
'0','0','The impact of Theseus / Severus on volume crime I believe is and will be significant . The startegy seems to be business as usual and the plethera of performance indicators continue unabated with no acknowledegement of the biggest policing operation since the second world war. The continous demand for increased levels of performance against such a background only adds to the perception that managemnt board operate on different levels and have seperated the issues in their own mind.'
'0','0','WE HAVE MAINTAINED REGULAR CONTACT WITH ALL OF OUR IDENTIFIED FAITH GROUPS IN THE FORM OF MEETINGS AND VISITS.  THIS HAS TAKEN PLACE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY.  THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY HAS RESULTED IN THEM FORMALLY INVITING US TO A MULTI FAITH  FOUNDATION MEETING TO EXPRESS THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICES.  IT IS PROPOSED TO REVIEW THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES WE ARE IN CONSULTATION WITH IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE ISOLATION
'0','0','There is a clear need for every BOCU to have a sufficient level of vetting for the borough commander and/or deputy for there to be no question about inclusion in the intelligence picture - this must allow restricted briefings to be given to all borough commanders who would then better be able to manage the implementation of the tactics determined in response to the threat'
'0','0','We have moved to 12 hour shifts in preference to using rest day working. My view on this is that providing you manage the 12 hour system and share it about it is less consuming. Also we need to guarantee staff their days off for recovery. Particularly over a protracted period. It is also cheaper. I am also providing meals from the canteen because that is cheaper than refreshment allowances.'
'0','0','Please do not treat boroughs like they do not know their own communities.  The advice and must do&#039;s coming from the centre were a disgrace.  The fact they were drip fed also gave the impression that as soon as anyone in the centre came up with an idea it was pumped out to Borough Commanders.  The tone of some of the emails was also condesending.  Much more helpful would have been a list of &#039;have you considered doing this - with a menu of options&#039; .The time turnaround on some replies were also ridiculous.  Most Borough Commanders are not sat at their desks waiting for emails and most staff officers have been deployed on Theseus - therefore a two hour or next day reply is unrealistic!!'
'0','0','I don&#039;t think it is a case of not worrying about overtime. We still have to try and work within budget but I am more concerned about the impact long term on my staff if we expect too much and do not manage effectively their roles. Safeguard their days off and it gives time to recover.'
'0','0','The demise of the RVCTF has left a void within the organisation to properly respond to the community demands. TPHQ (Safer neighbourhoods/ Emerald) had to fill that gap from scratch. This was to stop boroughs being overwhelmed for information. No Templates or system in place. We were being led by COBRA&#039;s demands (update every 3 hours) and the National Coummunity Tensions Team which was quite ridiculous. The role of Bronze Community was not defined and the command structure around community tension. I feel that the tone I pick up is that we do not trust borough commanders to do their job so we demand plans and patronise them by stating the obvious. We need to incorporate this work into Safer Neighbourhoods and learn so that we do not get caught again.'
'0','0','ONE OF OUR OFFICERS WAS  A VICTIM OF THE INCIDENT WHICH OCCURED ON THE 21/7. HE WAS TRAVELLING ON THE TRAIN - WARREN STREET.  THE OFFICER HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE BOROUGH AND HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN AT THE LACK OF CONTACT FROM THE INVESTIGATION TEAM.<br />THE BOROUGH HAS DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY&#039;S CCTV OFFICE WHERE THEIR CAMERAS WILL REGULARLY MONITOR TRAIN 
'0','0','I don&#039;t think it is feasible to cancel all leave. Officers need time to recover. There is less likely to be increases in sickness if we are effective in communicating the methods by which we will cope with demands. The important thing is making sure that ALL staff within the MPS are contributing.'
'0','0','Revenue at tube stations has gone through the roof - in some cases an increase of 50%.  Although the cost benefit would need to be done I suggest some form of analysis around this because it could be cost effective for BTP and or MPS partnership to employ PCSOs at all transport hubs - purely through revenue increase (less fare dodging)'
'0','0','We have had two instances of irresponsible local news reporting. One linking a Community colleague to being a Hotbed of radicalism and terrorism. The second criticising a specific use of Sec 44 powers. The usage being in response to public information and belief a suspect may be a bus bomber. The officers acted responsibly and with respect. The report was clearly mis-represnting what the circumstances were. A strongly worded letter of complaint has been sent to the particular newspaper.'
'0','0','I agree and as one who had to impart some of the messages I felt that there was a lack of trust in the borough commanders. There is a real sense that the centre needs to know everything and there should be plans for everything. We did away with the link commander structure almost immediately which broke the link.'
'0','0','WE have had a couple of instances of central units approaching our officers direct to work in their unit. The first we knew of one such approach was when the officer telephoned from SO. We cannot effectively account for and be responsible for the welfare and health and sfety of our staff if approaches are not co-ordinated through a SPOC (Ops or whatever).'
'0','0','We have had to place our core teams on 12 hr shifts in order to release the late turn to supply central aid. The central aid is now larger than the late turn team requiring additional staff. Local reassurance patrol dictates take no account of the number of stations each borough has. In essence 35% of our BWT are on either local or central aid. This is peak annual leave time and school holidays (the latter presenting child care issues.) I note with interest the Commissioners recent speech which reminds staff of the need to take their leave. The Commissioners committment does not seem to have cascaded downwards. The reality is that to deliver the afore mentioned aid staff cannot take time off and we are having to make significant use of staff on rest days. We now are faced with challenges under Health and Safety and WTD and when we have raised these centrally we have little to no sympathy or understanding. Some staff have now worked 21days in a row and this cannot continue.<br />In addition the resilience for the CID departments and day to day investigations is neglible so we have now had to place the CID on 12 hour shifts.<br />I would like to see a review of aid requests and greater sympathy re WTD. Support from central units should be given to boroughs with an extensive number of stations or central aid should be reduced to reflect this.<br />I would also like to see a committment to full reimbursement.'
'0','0','Quick question about recent TfL deployments. How have they been decided upon - and what capacity is there for local Boroughs to influence/bid for them. They clearly represent a significant MPS resource (particularly in relation to transport links) - and yet we have experienced difficulties in getting assistance from them.'
'0','0','WE HAVE MAINTAINED REGULAR CONTACT WITH SPECIFIC GROUPS WHICH WE FEEL WOULD BE AT RISK.  THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THROUGH WEEKLY VISITS TO THEIR PLACES OF WORSHIP AND COMMUNITY CENTRES.  AT THESE MEETINGS A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT MESSAGE IS DELIVERED BY THE SMT MEMBERS WHO ATTEND WHICH REFLECTS THE MPS POSITION.'
'0','0','A quick win for officers and Borough operations - would be for Management Board to allow 15 days annual leave to be carried over for next year.  Hopefully this will smooth out performance issues over a longer period otherwise performance this year will really suffer.'
'0','0','I think it is time to acknowledge that it is NOT business as usual.  Boroughs are barely functioning and most investigations are being robustly screened - many potential sanction detections will be lost.  We obviously do not want to cause alarm within the community BUT THEY ARE NOT STUPID. Manangement board need to ensure portfolio heads are not demanding from boroughs their ususal service - for example the CCSM headed by Commander Foy should be one of the first casulties.'
'0','0','The learning from this about information flow for me has been:<br />(i) Have a system to monitor requests to and from boroughs
'0','0','Management Board need to bury their pride and ask for aid from surrounding forces'

MUSLIM SCHOOLS REGULARLY VISITED.  DEDICATED OFFICERS EMPLOYED AT GTHE LOCAL AUTHORITY&#039;S CCTV OFFICE.<br />CONTACT MADE WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANNING OFFICER (EPO) AND GENERAL INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC VIA THE LOCAL PAPER
'0','0','As a person who was trying to get a grip of this for TP I found the demand for information from boroughs was extrodinary and unnecessary. Who reads them and gives boroughs feedback? We were being led by the Government for COBRA and MB as they do not trust borough commanders to do thier jobs. Trust?'
'0','0','THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION AS TO THE SECTION 44 POWERS AND NORMAL STOP AND SEARCH
'0','0','The organisation is not that far adrift from its targets and I don&#039;t believe the situation is beyond recovery. There may need to be a little more understanding about individual performances across the Boroughs. Upto the 7/7 our performance was challenged because it is said we had less funds than last year. Unfortunately the success we had last year although significant was bought. Without funding we have gone back to almost where we were. Someone needs to understand that we need to learn how to manage success. I fail to see how carrying over 15 days would help. I will be inclined toward suporting those officers of mine who ask

'1','219','Requested to attend btp hammersmith to standby
'1','245','wnet to Liverpool st and then Aldgate to help with evacuation not given a specific role
'1','223','I was aware that there may have been secondary devices and helped to set up cordons around the area to keep the public safe'
'1','224','i did not have an initial role until being instructed to attend the mortuary'
'1','212','my initial role was to attend waterloo station to conduct initial area search of both stations and organise resources for high profile security presence'
'1','217','I agree - when I was directed to the Mortuary the next day
'1','270','When the scale of the incident was established I requested staff to start maintaining a log of events. I briefed the head of the Govt Office for London. I then contacted the relevent Coroners to brief them.'
'1','242','I had absolutely no idea what was expected of me in the mortuary until we started working in there. once we got going it all fell into place.'
'1','218','Was lead to believe that we were to do cordon duties at HAC. Had no idea what the true extent of the duties I was to be involved in.'
'1','269','why were bodies going to a hotel?'
'1','214','Would this prevent you entering the scne as it was to rescue the public?'
'1','245','given job at temp mortuary the following day but no real idea what that involved'
'1','217','there was little to no information for officers directed to the mortuary about the tasks required of them. it was only on arrival there we found out exactly what was needed'
'1','270','Although I was responsible for establishing the mortuary I was not aware of this briefing'
'1','260','what did you expect'
'1','226','Had no direction just went with my instinct and assisted where I could
'1','224','got all the way to Hendon only to be told we had to travel down to HAC for a futher briefing. Time wasted'
'1','261','I agree also
'1','218','There was only a very breif description of my duties on arrival. Was told that if you completed the paperwork incorrectly then it could cause major complications in the investigation. As I had never even seen the forms before or completed them
'1','245','everyone was learning new skills'
'1','217','I agree with this. for the first couple of days it was very stressful'
'1','267','Knowingwhat you do now
'1','212','on the second day i was contacted and directed to attend hendon for mortuary dties
'1','270','There was a lot of confusion as to the location of the body holding areas for each site especially the Tavistock Place site.'
'1','220','after initial confusion at hendon
'1','269','There was no briefing at Hendon no one knew what was going on we were then sent to HAC'
'1','264','it was identified at an early stage to be a suitablr venue.which it was never going to be. at least a dozen officers wasted the whole day there.poor communication did not assist'
'1','267','Was this the Russell Square Incident?'
'1','264','yes it was.'
'1','242','No body can know how long these things are going to take
'1','224','I too agree
'1','218','Although I had no idea of what I was doing at the start. It was an experience I do not wish to forget. The learning curve went from 0 - 100 in a day.'
'1','223','there were numerous units on site 
'1','245','once the confusion at Hendon was over
'1','270','BTP need a formal trained Body Recovery Team who are aware of their responsibilities.'
'1','220','little or no information at hendon.all became clear at mortuary site.'
'1','212','this is not strictly true it was explained that the duration was at least 10-14 days and it only just went over the 14 day period'
'1','217','i&#039;d tell them what they&#039;d expect to see
'1','218','When BTP uniform officers arrived at HAV they had no idea what they were to do there.'
'1','226','Again I agree.  I requested to be considered for the mortuary and was fortunate to be deployed there.  However with no structure initially in place it took a while for the set up and requirements of me to be understood .'
'1','219','were bodies placed into this body holding area.'
'1','253','That one needs to be of a certain type to be able to cope with the situation. That you need to be able to detatch yourself from empathy with the victim. To put people in that position who had no preparation
'1','265','there was suggestion that the army establishment in handel street 
'1','224','we were requested to attend our area hq
'1','258','established that there was almost no practical relevant experience amongst the btp contingent detailed for the mortuary.'
'1','218','Totay agree. It all very soon started to fall into place'
'1','270','We need a properly trained  mortuary team to respond to these incidents and train crashes'
'1','261','I would explain to them about the particular distastes of the job along with how important it is. But also it would help if a dedicated resource was set up for incidents like this.'
'1','245','the option to leave was given to all on the first day at the mortuary'
'1','267','If you had been better briefed at to what was expected of you for the role you ended p doing
'1','262','Prior to this event were there any directives in place for such an event that were not passed out to the sector stations within the LU so as officers could react accordingly as it seemed to me that senior managers or event planning did not have a full realisation on how best to deploy officers and then when in situ officers still being contacted to attend other locations as part of other seriels
'1','269','it was pointed out at HAC briefing the job could last around 14 days'
'1','221','although i had many years of experience in the mortuary and had dealt with the bank exrcise i was missed off the list to attend the mortuary and felt that i was not utilising my skills'
'1','219','It is imperative that a body holding  area is identified
'1','223','I was on static security patrols for a few days after and volunteered to be on the mortuary team.I am sure that some people are more suited to this work than others'
'1','218','Totaly agree. Also tell them of the lack of sleep on the first couple of days and the stress that they would be under. DONT PANIC!!!'
'1','264','i was at the hotel with an officer from so13. we thought the handel street venue more suitable
'1','217','I agree -  every person in this room served BTP exceptionally well. it would be a crying shame if the skills learnt were not formalised and the organisation didn&#039;t take the opportunity to organise a body recovery/dvi team'
'1','255','It&#039;s now obvious that the people responsible for iniating movement for mortuary duties
'1','250','there was an option given prior to any mortuary duties for anyone to leave'
'1','253','Also need trained BTP DVI staff
'1','245','felt the BTP on the first day were more concerned about paying overtime than getting the job done
'1','242','DCI Williams gave a good initial briefing on the Friday but until you DVI a body you can&#039;t know what it&#039;s like. i do now .'
'1','263','MPS gave a criteria for the skills required in a preference order however the difficulty was identifying officers with the right skills quick time'
'1','218','Can not agree more. It would be a shame to lose the experience that all the officers gained during this difficult time.'
'1','258','understand that fraud squads are designated to carry out mortuary duties under the National Policing Plan. BTP contingent were made up of experienced CID from all London areas including Fraud Squad.'
'1','212','we now have a trained team who are wholly committed to assisting in any way in the future'
'2','0','What am I most proud about'
'1','220','in the dark but fortunate be part of very good team with an xcellent supervisor.'
'1','255','Part of a job well done'
'1','224','being able to give the families of the deceased the identities within 7 days'
'1','263','The dedication and determination of officers to get a difficult job done'
'1','214','I am proud of the commitment and the uncomplaining nature of the people that pulled together to get the job done'
'1','217','I am proud to be part of BTP after this. we entered the mortuary untrained  and unaware of what was needed. we left it 2.5 weeks later with sincere thanks from DCI Williams for a job well done. Every person played there part to the full'
'1','245','I agree. now feel part of a special effort and feel the BTP should maintain the skills and allow these officers to be part of a national network to assist in the future where possible'
'1','261','Being able to be apart of something huge and important that whilst unprepared and uninformed about we did a very good job.'
'1','270','I was proud of being the author of the Mortuary Plan that everyone was working too and also the superb way the BTP at site responded to the challenge even though most were untrained for the role.'
'1','218','The team that I worked with was amazing. Although we had a very serious job to be getting on with
'1','260','that me and my colleagues dived straight into something that we had never experienced before and learnt new skills'
'1','220','being part of good team and providing a valuable service to the families.'
'1','215','That non uniformed officers from BTP buildings &#039;dropped everything&#039; and went direct to scenes to assist the injured.'
'1','265','The fact that the BTP responded in such a positive and proffessional way  - that individual officers did some fanastic things - that the BTP is recognised throughout the world in an exceelant light'
'1','226','To have been able to work in such a dramatic incident and to say that we as a team helped those families that lost members of their family.'
'1','250','that i was part of an essential team with a very important role'
'1','258','part of a team that was motivated by working to help the families of the victims'
'1','245','being able to help those who has]d lost loved ones to be reunited with them through i/d'
'1','211','The recovery of the victims in a dignified manner
'1','261','Am proud to be BTP as if I hadn&#039;t  been with the force I wouldn&#039;t have had the chance to do what I did.'
'1','267','BTP didn&#039;t disgrace itself with the response provided to the multi-location incidents
'1','223','I am proud to have contributed to helping the victims families get closure.I was pleased to be part of a team which did not look for the quedos but gave help and support to all the teams within the mortuary set up.'
'1','224','you need a good slap on the back for that one
'1','221','being a part of a team that got the job done and bonded as a family whilst at the village and showed the professionalism that BTP have and the dedication for the role they do'
'1','220','btp being treated as equals with the met.forging a good working relationship with them.'
'1','253','The fact that BTP
'1','214','Has anyone in authority tahnked you personally for devising the plan
'1','217','the humour was needed. we needed that release from the stress and strain. everyone
'1','245','Agree
'1','270','Although not everyone at the site was aware due to a busy work schedule I was pleased that every BTP ACPO member visited the mortuary.'
'1','212','as discussed with colleagues after the events of the mortuary had been completed ther was a sense of real achievement that we had ben able to reunite all the families with their lost ones
'1','218','To be told on a regular basis by MPS that the un trained BTP doing body recovery from the site to the mortuary and of those taking the bodies from those officers
'1','264','by the time we were told that our hotel venue was not to be used we had managed to set up a facility that could have worked however unsuitable.To be part of the mortuary team and feel a sense of achievment.'
'1','242','I felt i was doing a valuable responsible and difficult job. I was proud to have been part of the team that dealt with the victims in a respectful way and identified them so they could be laid to rest by there loved ones.'
'1','260','i totally concur with the above'
'1','269','Being part of a team (DVI) that was contributing to a major incident. I knew the work we were doing was important to the investigation and to the victims families. For the first time in many years I felt I was doing something worthwhile.'
'1','222','The  service provided by BTP and MPS for  family members to view victims'
'1','217','i&#039;ll say it again - it would be a shame if these skills were just allowed to dribble away. let&#039;s build on them and expand them. we proved btp are just as capable'
'1','218','This could have been done a little sooner. Some of the teams at the mortuary did not see any BTP ACPO members and felt abandoned.'
'1','270','The BTP officers at the mortuary integrated seemlessly with the other officers from the MPS and City and also the other agencies. There was a very good rapport between everyone.'
'2','0','What difficulties did I have to overcome'
'1','262','Being able to help out with the investigation as a young in service PC although not young in years and to be able to gain so much from other officers and finally being able to give some sort of closure for the familys of the victims. The team effort was great and working within an inviroment with a  great sense of humour and dedication to the job in hand.'
'1','218','Me to.'
'1','245','the respnse from other forces to the worked carried out by BTP at the temp mortuary proved we are now more respected than before'
'1','212','have to say that over the period of time we spent there with you and others and saw your creation grow daily was really a site to behold
'1','223','I agree 
'1','245','closure not a phrase families like
'1','270','This was exceptional and has become the &quot;gold standard&quot; for future incidents. It was amazing to hear the reactions of the bereived families'
'1','267','It was awesome to see that which only appeared in paper form
'1','217','yes. horrible though it was
'1','253','Must admit it was first rate that you were so fundamental in production of the plan. At a time when BTP seem to have gone completely backwards in secondments and attachments out of force
'1','226','I feel that we walked into the mortuary with no idea and no skills to deal with what was expected yet when we left
'1','269','Who are you?'
'1','262','Having been passed this information will the officers dealing be thought of for future DVI or BODY RECOVERY COURSES.'
'1','211','TA centre handel street
'1','224','fear of the unknown'
'1','270','Occasional snide remarks about &quot;railway police&quot; from a handful of Met Officers.'
'1','245','agree the city did not perform well and did not on the whole become part of the team
'1','217','there has been little preparation for a return to &#039;normality&#039;.'
'1','270','Hear Hear!!!!!!'
'1','222','fatigue'
'1','260','we had no idea what we were meant to do'
'1','258','I was amongst those present that thought ACPO attendance @ the mortuary was slow. In hindsight there were more pressing engagements for the brass to attend. When it arrived it was sincere and interested.'
'1','245','being away from family'
'1','265','too many tasks &amp; not enough time to do them all!'
'1','226','Being sent to the mortuary with no skills or expertise in the paperwork required for such a huge operation.'
'1','223','Working within an unknown enviroment helping the met team liasing with LRT and WCC'
'1','242','Proud to be in the railway !!!!'
'1','245','dont agree from DVI side'
'1','217','this could have been made easier on us had they taken ten minutes to tell uswhat it was actually about'
'1','215','Getting the Met to acknowledge and act upon the assistance being offered by BTP'
'1','270','This again leads back for a properly trained BTP team'
'1','224','obnoxious people who thought that they as a force were better than us.'
'1','220','main difficulty was being away from home and working long hours.'
'1','218','The paperwork. The forms were new for everyone (MPS and BTP). At first I was unsure what to do. After a quick brefing on the forms and the body recovery book and after a few runs
'1','262','Having just becoming a Dad for the third time 
'1','255','This has been said before
'1','250','getting paid my correct overtime'
'1','261','Being unprepared for what to expect and not having any kit for the first few days which meant performing mortuary duties in uniform.'
'1','270','Training requirement!'
'1','222','i agree we need dvi training'
'1','253','We are just as capable
'1','218','Very long hours.'
'1','267','Having to take on the role sometime into the incident and not from the very beginning of the incident.  This allowed matters at the mortuary to get to a point where issues were occurring which were detracting from what the officers there needed to be doing
'1','260','the grass is no greener on their side'
'1','269','It was a personal challenge to work in the mortuary. Having little experience of dead bodies and pathology I was unsure of my reaction to the situation. Although difficult I coped well as did my colleagues who I knew had similar feelings.'
'1','218','Didnt let it get to me. What were they doing? Cordons?'
'1','253','CC did attend
'1','221','the intergration from the running of the mortuary in the NHS to the police force and dealing with victims of explosion was a shock i thought i had seen everything but first day in the mortuary at HAC i felt like i knew nothing'
'1','242','Being away from home not knowing for haw long'
'1','217','it was clear in the first couple of days senior managment appeared to have no idea what they were sending us to. when i asked for a phone i was told &#039;go inside and use one&#039; inside where? when clothing became an issue
'1','224','not having our own managers contacting us to check on our welfare
'1','264','whether or not i would be able cope working in the mortuary. i did not want to let myself or any of my colleagues down.'
'1','245','brings us back to point not to let those skills now gained go to waste and for BTP management to take the Railway blinkers off and allow those now trained (the hard way) to assit other forces as well as our own if other incidents occurr.'
'1','223','don&#039;t agree due the to nature of the event.I feel that we did work long hours but 
'1','265','Hopefully this process will lead to a cog decision inrelation to DVI teams for btp
'1','212','over the first few days there were numerous difficulties at the mortuary
'1','217','yes'
'1','267','Is &quot;they&quot; within BTP (who in theory would not know) or those organising the mortuary who perhaps would have had more idea
'1','226','I feel that the BTP should have it&#039;s own dedicated DVI team and there is no-one better than the people that are sitting here now and those that could not make it today!!  Sort out those courses BTP!!!'
'1','270','The mortuary training course is only 3 days long - not a huge investment for such an important subject when the lack of training could lead to cross-contamination which could compromise an important investigation.'
'1','223','agree'
'1','245','I did not get this from the met officers I wrked with
'1','260','this is something at least the coppers at the sharp end know needs to happen but will the management learn and take action'
'1','253','Completely agree. We were ambassadors for the BTP response
'1','218','Only on the journey to and from sites. If you collected more than 20 body parts / bodies
'1','261','I agree
'1','242','Never had anything said to me in malice. Anyway you have to give them stick back
'1','211','BTP have one DVI recovery officer
'2','0','Welfare'
'1','270','At least someone from FHQ came to sort out overtime
'1','245','having a day off and feeling like I should be back with colleagues during the operation'
'1','253','Totally agree. MPS were professional
'1','267','Not sure wer ewill every return to normality
'1','263','lack of information from MPS S013 in relation to certain investigative parameters which caused delay (cctv retrieval parameters/intel links) which caused some frustration in resources sitting around but not deployable as SO13 had primacy'
'2','0','Leadership / Management'
'1','253','This was much appreciated
'1','224','having to fight to get the overtime and expenses back.'
'1','217','once bronze was appointed
'1','212','again i agree with this but as far as i am concerned not one of us let  anyone down and can all leave with our heads held high'
'1','264','i agree that our feeling was that they had been stung into a response rather than a genuine concern for welfare'
'1','223','spot on
'1','269','Can&#039;t agree with this I have never had problems with officers from other forces including those at the mortuary. Mind you them City boys and girls..................'
'1','260','we deserved it'
'1','211','The only BTP dvi officer is met trained and is on C11call out
'1','218','It would be a great loss if the officers who were trained on the job by MPS (who thought that we were already trained) did not receive formal training. MPS made it clear to us that we did a truly difficult job but amazed them with how proffessional we were'
'1','226','If there was one thing I was told whilst at the mortuary. Doesn&#039;t matter how long it takes do it properly and don&#039;t rush.  We got there in the end.'
'1','270','With about 30 BTP at the mortuary it would have been very useful for an Insp on site for the initial 2 weeks to handle any problems queries etc.'
'1','221','there should now be put into place a dedicated team of DVI officers for BTP if they listen to one comment it should be this one'
'1','263','knowing that we were deploying untrained/untested resources into crucial roles'
'1','258','First practical problem was the need for appropriate kit. On this occasion the Met &amp; City were glad to let us mump their kit. Next time (hopefully not) we MUST have a readily available supply to get over the first 48 hours'
'1','267','Unlikely due to cost implications for BTP.  We would be very unlikely to use the skills on our own patch very often and would leave ourselves open to having to lend those with the skills to national and international incidents which would have the &quot;Paymasters&quot; particularly LUL asking &quot;why are we paying for this&quot;'
'1','253','Who needs a course
'1','220','having just returned from g8 for a week to then after a few rest days go to london for 8 days.return home for  a few rest days and then return to london for a further 12 days for high profile patrols.so out of all of july only spent about 6 days at home.at home i found it difficult to unwind/relax.i also found it difficult to eturn to normal beat duties.'
'1','269','sounds like you needed a rest'
'1','218','Cant thank bronze enough. They realy did take us under their wing.'
'1','245','wanting to speak about it but to those outside of our tam. we were like a tented village and did not want to retuen to normal duty
'1','223','Don&#039;t worry a complaint went into there inspector 
'1','262','Agreed
'1','261','Agree
'1','220','found on some days going on automatic pilot/slow motion.'
'1','222','what prep are making for the next one'
'1','269','From my experience the BTP equited themselves very well and came oiut of this with flying colours!'
'1','258','Training is available (mortuary &amp; exhibits) - since we are a national force &amp; obviously transport is a key target we must not let this opportunity slip.'
'1','220','impressed by met who offered occ health and welfare support.'
'1','267','I&#039;m unclear as to whether or not Gold was aware of the extent of the collected BTP involvement until far too late into the operation of the mortuary.  A senior BTP officer there from day 1 would have help that communication flow immensely and could possibly have prevented some of the problems that surfaced in those initial days.'
'1','262','Being given full and frank advice from Metpol officers within the mortuary team whom had a wealth of experiance within this field.'
'1','226','Souns like you need to get back to work....'
'1','222','excellent support from both btp and met'
'1','210','the team i was part of was very fortunate to have an excellent met inspector for our leadership.'
'1','261','Finding hard to adjust as have to ask myself how can adapt to a 5 3 A now after being involved with dealing with 56 bodies.'
'1','253','Thought BTP did us proud
'1','267','As ever BTP think about this issue when it rears its head through problems.  Never one of the first things that are done for any incident'
'1','265','H&amp;S officer from FHQ did attend to look at arrangements for BTP officers'
'1','255','Did BTP occupational health make a personal visit at all
'1','270','The Met Occ Health and Welfare were supposed to be representing all 3 forces but I am not sure the message got through. I know BTP Occ Health &amp; Welfare were in contact with the Met team'
'1','218','I felt the BTP gave a very delayed approach. We did not have the correct clothing and this took a few days to get dealt with.'
'1','217','for the first couple of days it was a bit of a joke. the organisation had no clue what we were doing in there until acpo came and saw for themselves. the met at one point were considering replacig us because we hadn&#039;t even been given a psychological (i think that&#039;s how u spell it) assessment before hand
'1','226','It shocked me as to the initial LACK of response and concern for the Mortuary team from BTP.  Eventually it arrived but by that time everyone was talking to each other and dealing with things in a different way.  The MET in the mortuary were great and their knowledge and advice was a great help
'1','223','I felt that management were aware to a degree although I know that there were people there that have been affected by previous major incidents!Did those poeple recieve prior councelling ensuring that they were ok to work within the enviroment.Is there a collated record of what events officers have attended in order to ensure that the same person is not used always unless they are absoulutly ok with it?'
'1','245','full support from the met machine. after the early moans about money the BTP came through with excellent support. individual officers from the LT div supported us off their own back'
'1','221','occ health did not approach me until last week for a welfare check'
'1','260','when will you learn'
'1','210','management at the mortuary offered constant support and checked upon are welfare.'
'1','224','The fact that for the first two weeks that we were at HAC
'1','255','Is that good enough?'
'1','269','I don&#039;t have any complaints about welfare. Considering the situation we were housed fed and clothed well. BTP reacted a little slower than Met &amp; City but hey that&#039;s why we luv em!'
'1','261','Felt like we were cut loose from the forcr and had to fend for ourselves. Met set up the temporary mortuary in 24 hours BTP took 48 hours to get us some clothing.'
'1','265','I think we have to remember that we are still limited as a force
'1','253','Thought BTP DCC Trotter came across the best on the media briefings
'1','258','Strange how small things leave lasting impressions. viz cold drinks available in the changing rooms. Massages etc.'
'1','222','management available if needed'
'1','263','Welfare was a priority from the very start with occupational health and Area HR&#039;s fully engaged - I was impressed with the dedication and understanding of the issues and what was put in place'
'1','262','This is a very narrow minded view i think as the PAYMASTERS should put themselves in the boots of those that lost loved ones. We would be an asset to the force and the job 
'1','270','Agree - BTP Welfafe and Occ Health need more resources and maybe more acknowlegement from Management.'
'1','212','this covers two areas firstly BTP
'1','218','The BTP OH are there for the BTP
'1','245','BTP endded up supplying clothes where needed but not all officers were catered for'
'1','269','Some officers seemed to get a lot more clothes than others.'
'1','267','Yes they did but didn&#039;t get the message out to everyone who was there and stayed for two hole days - one was a Friday
'1','242','Graham Williams was a bloody good leader in what must have been a very stressful job. Good old fashioned common sence man [sorry resource] management. He was universally respected as a good guv&#039;nor so he got the most out of his troops. Some BTP higher ranks could learn a lot from him.'
'1','265','BTP occ health were indunated dealing with officers who were first responders
'1','253','Think this is unfair
'1','218','Would love to of been able to meet them. Never got approached or managed to speak with them.'
'1','217','as soon as we got a bronze appointed
'1','264','Met and City semed to have a structured welfare response. Our force seemed to have no idea unless told. Probably because BTP have no idea about the practicalities of DVI and therefore no idea what we may be going through or may reqiure in support. i got the feeling that management hoped it would all go away.<br />I have been contacted by Met colleagues on welfare issues.'
'1','270','I was involved with the mortuary at Fulham for the Tsunami and was told that from the Welfare aspect I was an &quot;honorurary&quot; MetPol Officer. - So much for that - I never heard from them again but did get good support from Sue Maxfield.'
'1','267','Space limittations become an issue and access to the mortuary premises - no excuse but the MPs team were not exactly overwhelmed with work
'1','226','The MET Insp and sargeant running the pod site were great.  Always there and always checking ensuring that we were catered for.  This was important for our initial arrival as they took the time to go through the requirements as the days went on.  Did not feel as though i could not approach them with questions'
'1','253','Totally agree about DCI Williams he was inpirational
'1','261','Agree he looked after all of us and made us feel part of his team not BTP thrown in to help the Met.'
'1','221','no one from btp asked me if i was up to date with my vaccinations this was important as we were dealing with so many different victims with no medical history to go on for example hep c infected victims'
'1','270','All the BTP worked long hard hours and did not want to take any time off as they were proud of the work they were doing.'
'1','217','he spoke to a few of us
'1','265','yes  I was concerned that probationers had been given this posting'
'1','255','Was that through the Met?'
'1','218','Some officers were there for a long length of time
'1','223','there was plenty of clothing from MET
'1','210','the met had food and drinks available throughout the shifts.'
'1','267','Very true and a direct result of no senior BTP officer assigned to Mortuary from the start
'1','217','by the end
'1','245','the CC attending but did not seek out the BTP officers to speak to
'1','223','yep 
'1','262','I worked hand in hand with officers from West Ham and found that we were very much left to our own train of leadership and self managment. Sgt HILL and DI TIPPING were outstanding in the field as was Mr TROTTER a true leader.'
'1','221','no through btp'
'1','253','I agree
'1','269','Don&#039;t agree
'1','212','they did turn up from FHQ and showed support and if you were around they did speak to us
'1','211','DVI includes recovery and Mortuary skills. All the officers who completed there duties in the mortuary have only completed part of the requirments
'1','270','When Chief Con attended the site he wanted to gather all BTP to speak to them but was told that this would be impractical as most were booted and suited in the mortuary.'
'1','265','yes andy trotter is good &#039;BTP talking head&#039;'
'1','217','however
'1','253','Some officers needed more clothes than others
'1','255','perhaps o h need extra training'
'1','261','Disagree the Chief did turn up and spoke to some of us but was only on site a short while.'
'1','226','I agree.  When the cards were layed down we showed our true colours and they shone through brightly!!'
'1','267','Efforts were made on most days to contact everyone at site regarding needs and wants-however
'1','253','On the DVI side there was no Met and BTP divide.....we were one team.'
'1','224','certain management didn&#039;t even bother contacting us
'1','212','not correct we were standing on the parade square and he walked passed us twice'
'1','245','DCI William is a born leader. he was funny at the briefing but always focused on the job in hand. all officers would have worked any hours and any duty for him.'
'1','218','We deal with alot more major incidents than the MPS (ie train crashes). I always feel that we let our selves down when we have to use other forces to do the Body Recovery because they have trained officers. Is it not time that the BTP invested in a team? They can still continue with the usual duties until the next major incident.'
'1','224','your lucky I am being plagued with calls from Occ health
'1','222','i agree this is unfair
'1','270','EVERYONE had food and drinks available throughout the shifts - indeed it was available 24 hours a day - there was no distinction between police officers
'1','211','This process can be easily remidied. the BTP DVI sole rep
'2','0','If BTP is a learning organisation
'1','269','Hear hear Mr Trotter did the BTP proud
'1','258','I got an email that listed a choice of 3 detective inspectors to contact in order to book a hotel room.<br />My impression is that it took too long for BTPmanagement to delegate specific responsibilities and there was far too much duplication of work at FHQ.<br />In contrast
'1','223','A massure (i think thats how you spell it) was brought down from Hendon
'1','210','excellent relationship with the uniform met inspectors who were always approachable and very helpful.'
'1','253','There were plenty of BTP on rest period
'1','245','he managed to walk straight past several BTP officers and spoke with EX met colleagues. ACC Robb mage a point of speaking to most and was ready to listen'
'1','226','After being assigned to Mortuary duties on the Monday come the Wednesday Event planning or should I say &quot;Can&#039;t plan anything&quot; had 3 officers on static duties 12 hours the next day
'1','267','We need to look at this in the context of a response to a major incident.  MPS have many more to deal with than BTP and have Depts commensurate with those requirements.  BTP don&#039;t have to do this sort of thing very often
'1','255','Or at least a up to date map of London'
'1','265','Good point 
'1','217','i think what&#039;s meant here is that the guys doing the van runs from the site were untrained
'1','245','WHY?'
'1','261','Certain L area senior officer in EPT seemed to be trying to interfere with postings of people and more concerned with his own self importance.'
'1','253','Totally agree. CC only spoke to Kevin Gordon
'1','223','you have lost me on that one ?'
'1','264','We have senior officers who as individuals are experienced in DVI. But there is no corporate response and i feel there never will be as long as someone else can do the work for them. I have since submiited a report to ACPO on  our DVI  response and  have received no reply which is what i expected. The BTP is a good Force but on occasion we at senior level let ousselves down.'
'1','270','There needed to be a proper one to one de-brief when staff left the mortuary. Although Police Officers are slow to admit it - everyone at the site was subject to stress on some scale - even if it was being a bit irritable with their family when they got home.'
'1','217','we are all his munchkins!!!!'
'1','267','With the very rigourous process that you were required to undertake
'1','253','Agree. He didn&#039;t speak to BTP Officer other than the one on the London Resiliance Team.'
'1','261','That the job was done well despite lack of training of most of the officers who were dealing and that this must be rectified through having fully trained and prepared officers for any eventuality like this.'
'1','255','Aren&#039;t they part of our Royal Family'
'1','245','team leaders were on the whole very good one city leader was not and would suggest that people be sellected on the role they can perform not because they are sgts'
'1','265','yes i agree'
'1','270','Body Recovery and DVI / Mortuary training is essential.'
'1','217','PLEASE let&#039;s have the training. let&#039;s have the confidence to do this ourselves. we&#039;ve proved we can
'1','224','i was over supervised with 2 DCI&#039;s and a DS they were a good bunch.'
'1','269','I would have liked one BTP senior officer to be a point of contact for all BTP at the mortuary. There were BTP from 3 area&#039;s and various departments within those area&#039;s. There was confusion as to who should be contacted re descisions on things like pay
'1','210','i had no problems with any of the met officers i had dealings with.'
'1','263','A bit unfair - senior ranks understood the position we were putting officers in and the difficult work being undertaken.  our staff needed to see senior ranks asap - and senior ranks wanted to get an understanding of the problems and conditions
'1','267','Being sent and staying are two different things.  In this situation
'1','226','BTP should take a great amount of encouragement and enthusiasm and understand the importance of having it&#039;s own DVI team.  The area commander seems to be in agreement
'1','262','How long does it take before the troops on the ground benifit from such an event other then those sitting a miliion miles away  from the task in hand who claim all the glory from those at the other end of the stick . In benifit i mean DVI or other related courses. We only have to look at what has happened over the pond in the States to see how we could help out.  We seem to like the idea of promoting such issues as L91 and such like to agencies from around the world
'1','218','All the knowledge that was gained by all the officers experiences must not be lost. All of the officers concerned in the mortuary learnt how to becove DVI officers
'1','253','agree'
'1','224','in this day of hiring the ex met officers can we not head hunt him for ourselves he could replace a number of our management.'
'1','265','I think this brings us back to the polint that nobody initailly knew what the duties were - and by then it was too late'
'1','267','stay or else - makes more sense!'
'1','221','i recieved a less than friendly phone call from above asking why i was not on static post at a mainline station that day i asked how i would possibly be able to cover the mortuary as well
'1','245','let those now trained be part of the national and international relief effort if required in the future. this requires regular assesment and  training
'1','261','Fact of the matter is that eventually another train crash will happen and if BTP do not take the opportunity to build and gain from this tragedy then we will have to go elsewhere and ask for assistance as usual.'
'1','217','BTP have proved they have the right calibre of people
'1','270','A welfare call home from a Senior Officer (even an Inspector) to wives at home would have been a good touch!'
'1','269','DCI Williams was inspirational
'1','212','a big question
'1','242','It&#039;s all about respect and the old saying you can&#039;t do enough for a good gonenor. Unfortunately a lot of our inspectors and above have been promoted without enough experience and punch above thier weight. They have not got their hands dirty and display little supervisory skills and petty mindedness
'1','223','I worked along side the met DS direct to DCI Williams.They were spot on with their attitudes and gave myself credit to act as a part of the team organising individual projects to ensure that resources were available to all the teams within the mortuary.Initially BTP didn&#039;t seem to have a focal point of contact but that was later resolved.'
'1','222','there was a chief inspector and civilian who when not on site were available by phone and would sort any problems from accom to clothing even o/t payments'
'1','260','so we could have coped then without the Met &quot;lending&quot; us a hand.NOT'
'1','224','they were too busy in their nice new counting house
'1','209','Does this mean international disasters'
'1','267','but on realising that first pang of realisation would allow you to formulate an opinion - then I appreciate all sorts of other things take over
'1','214','The fact that BTP officers not only stood up to be counted (they always do) but that they received this recognition on a world wide stage and have raised the profile and standing of the Force so much. I consider it an honour to work with people that did such a fantastic job'
'1','269','Perhaps you needed it!'
'1','226','I spoke with a number of DVI trainers who have said that they will not charge the BTP for the course all they ask for is a class room and there accomodation paid for
'1','270','Absolutely agree - We need the training NOW to ensure the skills learned and collected by our officers at the mortuary are not forgotten'
'1','253','Amazing someone tells a joke
'1','265','did he know who you were?'
'1','218','Even during training we were told it is not a matter of IF but WHEN!!!!'
'1','253','He paid well
'1','245','we have proved to other forces (mps) and government that the BTP can assist with all areas of policing and recovery not just one unders. the btp must committ to the use of these officers should their help be requested in the future. we are all on the same side.'
'1','211','agree
'1','270','After all the Train Crashes and other incidents the BTP have responded to and dealt with so well it should be US offering training to other police forces!'
'1','212','Yes
'1','267','What do you mean by plagued?  As they requesting to see or speak to you
'1','262','Looking at the core skills aquired by its officers and not thinking of the purse strings. We need to come into line with other forces in relation to these sort of events and not stay in the dark ages. The bombings have proved that we need to be more proactive in regards to policing the railways and look at other ways forward
'1','258','It took over 24 hours from the the time of the explosions before the issue of who was going to pay for officers overtime to be settled. Officers detailed to carry out duties were given conflicting advice as to whether they could actually work.<br />Are there agreements laid out to cover National Emergencies like this?'
'1','261','Of course not and neither could the Met as proved by our involvement and City and Hearts Pol. But the fact was three of the four crime scenes were on our patch.'
'1','245','do not let the skills slip so if something happens in the future we will not be sending in other officers blind. TRAINING...'
'1','270','Yes we have the knowledge within force to do this training.'
'1','214','I think all the comments are well made and need to be given serious consideration. Hopefully that is what the debrief outcomes will enable us to do.'
'1','242','To treat officers who are doing a difficult job such as the DVI teams like adults'
'1','263','The names of officers who worked at the mortuary and are now fully trained in DVI must be held in a readly available format (i.t system) in order that we can deploy in the future and not waste the skills acquired. Further officers should also be trained in DVI.'
'1','245','Railway with guns????'
'1','269','Thats nice to know now who are they?'
'1','253','That the BTP should have it&#039;s own DVI Team resource
'1','224','they drew the short straw unfortunately for them
'1','242','I&#039;m in total agreement'
'1','210','we must continue to build our skills by further assistance to other forces and through training/courses.'
'1','218','No we could not have coped! But untrained BTP officers proved that we can all work as a team with other forces and learn (not only MPS
'1','267','Was the lack of an on site senior BTP officer present a contribution to this feeling of being cut off?'
'1','223','There was a lot of outside interference from this individual more concerend about resources for static patrols.Does he understand the fact that we put ourselves out working long hours doing a stressfull enough job 
'1','212','a very negative view
'1','221','then take a list of those people who attended and use it to best advantage before everyone forgets us . unless they already have a list of those officers'
'1','261','Scary thought!'
'1','270','Hear Hear'
'1','253','Failure to address this issue will be the end of the BTP
'2','0','Personal messages to the Chief and his team'
'1','267','How does this correlate with the &quot;complaints to Force&quot; of working many days without time off?'
'1','226','I have spoken to number of officers (in soecialised roles) and when asked what I done on the bombings I explained Mortuary duties.  They looked at me in a sense of envy and disgust that they should have been doing it instead.'
'1','262','A shame that some officers made such coments
'1','264','It must realise that there is more to Policing than prisioners and crime stats. We have a responsibility to the people we serve to be the best we can. If our ACPO showed the same level of committment as the chaps i worked with in the mortuary things would be rosy.Training is essential and must be structured from FHQ. Areas will not support a DVI response and training programme unless pushed. We should learn to see policing as policing UK and not be so parochial. Some officers from London South were going to be pulled out of the Mortuary team because of a lack of budget to pay overtime.'
'1','221','so lets get the list of officers capable up and running now'
'1','245','in the past most incidents involving large scale deaths have occurred on BTP property (including 7/7) we have had to depend on met and locals for DVI and ort duties. not good enough. we now have officers who can perform these functions lets keep them trained and included on national database and use the skills we have'
'1','258','What happens when the next incident
'1','269','It is a credit to this force that the officers deployed to the tempoary mortuary performed so well without any training. For the officers on the DVI teams it was presumed that they had undergone formal training when in fact they had not. Yet again it is the rank and file that fly the flag for this organisation.'
'1','270','Although these were posted on the BTP intranet - surelymanagement knew that we did not have access to the intranet at the mortuary!!!!!!'
'1','214','Yes this was an awesome piece of work and the author has been thanked. This together with other presentations has been given over the last two days to a group of European Transport Police senior officers. They could not stop praising BTP for what he has been doing. They have asked to form a joint working group so they can learn from the skills and experience of all of the staff that made all this happen.'
'1','261','I absolutely agree
'1','217','please do not ignore anything in this debrief. we served you well
'1','212','only if the powers that be see this type of report and take time to read it
'1','255','Quite simple
'1','218','We really do need DVI (formaly trained) officers. It would be a great resource for a national police force.'
'1','260','Agreed.We can only get better if were given the experience.You can train for ever but come the real thing...........'
'1','210','we must start to promote our force as equal and the best way would be to fully train officers in these necessary skills.'
'1','265','absolutely big events planned or unplanned are viewed &#039;pan london&#039; response'
'1','270','It would have been useful to have access to BTP Computer systems at the Mortuary to check emails and see what else was going on. Met had access to their aware system'
'1','253','You have a trained resource that have aquitted themselves creditably as DVI Officers. We should be leading this issue not the poor relations
'1','245','Det Supt Carroll attended the mortuary and stated that the BTP have a trianed DVI team now. This is true but training needs to be current and up to date to use them in the future'
'1','224','hire graham williams immediately
'1','222','the force is moving in the right direction
'1','270','Give Graham Williams a job'
'1','255','Do you now intend to develop and nuture the skills obtained or just bin them'
'1','214','the debrief will not be ignored
'1','218','Seconded'
'1','217','so we let things contnue the way they are?'
'1','245','we can learn a great deal in man management from him'
'1','242','The rank and file once again fly the flag for the BTP. Our bosses must seek to raise the profile of this force and not be bullied by the big boys from the MET.'
'1','262','Many thanks for being given the chance to work within this inviroment. Although i volountered for this tour of duty i never thought that i would be asked to attend given my lack of knowledge and experiance in this field of work. Do not let the hard work of all those officers fall to the wayside becuase of finacial implications. I&#039;m sure that having been supplied wth extra shreddies and socks we could push the boat out and get the courses sorted.'
'1','217','this sounds both encouraging and hopeful'
'1','270','Acknowledge the work done by ALL of your officers. Dont allow the skills they have learned to be lost.'
'1','212','this is good to hear
'1','214','a fair point but everyone was doing their best and this was a gap in the way the information was shared - definately one to remember in another major incident!'
'1','245','I do hope not'
'1','265','note the comments regarding London South management (or lack of it) and also guard against L area &#039;going native&#039;'
'1','261','We are a national force and we need dedicated resources as part of that. If a train crashe happens in Scotland we should be able to provide some of the key resources at least.'
'1','211','The whole of the Met Police DVI team (21 MPS and 1 BTP) was deployed on 7/7 if another incident occurred
'1','269','I can not think of another UK police force that should have a DVI capability as much as the BTP. History shows that we deal with major incidents nationwide (train crashes / terrorist incidents). The capability to send a DVI team anywhere in the country would be a great achievment for this force. It would enhance our reputaion with other forces and the public and would cost very little to put in place.'
'1','253','Why should someone who has attended the briefest of training cascade this knowledge to others
'1','217','then he can be our munchkin!!!!!!!!'
'1','260','Ill give my shreddies back if it helps'
'1','223','I feel that BTP should stand up and proudly shout about the good work that all its officers achieved from this.Have the gile to demand and put into place training for a BTP DVI team.Have a resource team who know exactly who has what skils and how to place them direct.I would hope that the officers that have been used and worked on THEASUS well 
'1','211','last entry should show 51 not 21 MPS and 1 BTP'
'1','261','Me too.'
'1','262','So will i.'
'1','226','I was told that BTP will listen to what we have to say.  What I want say I will say to the faces of the people that matter i.e.  Area Commander
'1','217','you&#039;ll have to take them off your head!!!!'
'1','269','I won&#039;t'
'1','245','we now have the so called CDU and major teams mis etc it is time for a DVI/mort standby team for rail crash and or acts of terror'
'1','270','We are proud of our force and acknowledge the huge changes you have made but we need to show and boast that we are the best force for dealing with disasters. Lets have a fully trained and properly led DVI team. You know it makes sense.'
'1','221','i feel that you should place an emergancy call up list of officers that remain dedicated to do btp proud'
'1','255','Isn&#039;t he too young'
'1','217','okay'
'1','253','Who is the sole trained DVI Officer? No one seemed to be trained before we went in there
'1','264','Please do not be so blinkered to believe everything you are told by others. Remember the story of The Emperor&#039;s new clothes.You may find it intersting to speak to the practitioners of policing not the theorists.'
'1','217','i keep getting munchkins confused with oompahloompahs - which ones are what'
'1','223','this team i am sure could be added to with members here today'
'1','270','Lack of any London South Management was noticable'
'1','242','Can i have the day of next Thursday'
'1','214','after 29 years if BTP officers can be pacified about something they believe in it will be a first! We need to get all of the ideas
'1','255','I don&#039;t wear any'
'1','263','The skills that our officers have or have obtained as a result of 7/7 must not be lost. we need I.T systems that capture All skills and can be easily interrogated. The size of occ health needs reviewing and what support is available outside at short notice. A logistics dept should be established to deal with officers needs/requirements - one phone number etc. Training particularly around disasters should be reviewed - we should not commit untrained officers to critical events. The gaps in our response needs looking at
'1','212','The duties we carried were unpleasant to put it politely
'1','226','I didn&#039;t get any......Got a nice fleece though'
'1','261','Thank you for being allowed to contribute to the biggest terrorist operation of it&#039;s kind and please show your appreciation by allowing us to build on this.'
'1','265','History shows that the force often fails to learn by experience a robust managemnt system is needed to ensure that action points are moved on in every department'
'1','261','At least you got one.'
'1','269','oompahloompahs have got brains munchkins have got muscle'
'1','214','only if you submit in triplicate and find someone to cover your shift!'
'1','226','One I got two different colours aswell.  Want one'
'1','217','how does the song go - I dare you!!!!!'
'1','245','this has been the proudest moment of my career to have helped and be part of this. please do not allow the work to be wasted by not aslowing us to remain trianed and ready to work'
'1','224','see previous comment about them in their counting house
'1','253','Please don&#039;t associate the work we did with the CDU or whatever they are now called.'
'1','245','no'
'1','260','why stay with  the uk.GAINING EXPERIENCE IS EVERYTHING'

'1','245','where were the BTP soco?'

'1','326','A BREIFING! Someone who knew what was going to happened (or pretend) someone to take charge and give reassurance. But most importantly INFORMATION!!!!!!'

'2','4186','What needs to be done to ensure that the strategic priorities become/remain realities?'
'1','317','INFORMATION INFORMATION INFORMATION'
'1','319','Just information
'1','335','All the available information about the incident. What had happened
'1','314','More information as to what
'1','304','what information would you have liked'
'1','326','Here Here!'
'1','331','We kenw we were going to be seeing people that had been searching hospitals for loved ones - would have liked to have more information on the set-up our processes what did the organisation ie MPS know'
'1','328','more information about our role. how many people were expected.'
'1','317','the facts not information from the press'
'1','313','System should have been implemented earlier-as a consequence more time and info to produce a structured briefing pack.'
'1','332','information about the incident who was where and what was being done to find the victims'
'1','334','Although i did not attend the intitial breifing i would have liked to see somebody with flo knowledge to address the persons with their thoughts of what we should expect. What forms to fill and as much info as possible .'
'1','312','Clear concise information so that we could focus staff on the core role and eliminate initial confusion'
'1','316','To have been informed that it was going to be an attachment away from borough for a length of time. That it was going to be an Assistance Centre rather than working with 1 family.'
'1','311','Wish we had been given all the info available as the media and families knew more than us.'
'1','326','Information to give to the families we could not tell them anything! THis made us feel useless and stupid'
'1','309','We have known for some time that we would be victims of a major incident and I feel that the skeleton format for the setting up and running of such a centre should have already been in existance and this would have facilitated a much smoother
'1','317','thats all some people see FLO&#039;s as!!'
'1','332','relatives and friends needed a one to one to discuss what they required.  most had telephoned cas bureau repeatedly and not knowing what this was for felt completely let down by the information being given out'
'1','329','A full and proper briefing.  The powers that be had had two days to sort everything out.  It was a real rush job and everyone was running around patting evryone on the back about what they had done in such a short space of time.  A pity it had to be so rushed.  The pats on the back should have been to the FLO&#039;s who made it work not the people who organised the settees.  Families on those first days were not concerned about the decorations and furniture.  They wanted help and they got it.  A very distressing time for everyone involved.'
'1','322','Information about the location of the incidents - to make clearer  the significance of the last known location of the people that were being sought.'
'1','321','A better location for a briefing with seats for all
'1','336','At one point no one appeared to know if there were any unidentified living casualties - I was given different information from various sources and felt totally unproffessional when I could not convey up to date information to families sho were clinging to the hope that their relatives could be still alive and unidentified'
'1','331','as well as a quicker response'
'1','319','Totally agree with that'
'1','326','plus the number for CB was wrong and one of the numbers was for some poor member of the public that kept being rang!'
'1','312','This info was vital on initial contact with families
'1','332','I agree that at some points we were given differing information and our whole ethos about being truthful'
'2','0','What difficulites did you have to overcome'
'2','0','What am I personally most proud about'
'1','317','I agree
'1','312','Lack of Knowledge at SMT level about FLO role'
'1','321','There should already have been a procdure to put in place FLO&#039;s
'1','332','that i contributed in some small way to alleviate the pain suffered by victims and relatives'
'1','331','every person/family that I dealt with left in a more positive manner than when they arrived regardless of how much true information I was/was not able to provide them with'
'1','317','I acted with professionlism and showed families I was human too -'
'1','332','I am very proud that despite having a lack of information that I was able to be professional caring and respectful to those families I spoke to and they appreciated all that I had done'
'1','309','I felt an enormous satisfaction that every visitor  I spoke to at the centre left feling better than when they walked in.'
'1','315','dont really feel proud about anything
'1','336','I developed a great rapport with other agencies at the Red Cross and felt that the work of FLO&#039;s was brought to the attention of them - they were very impressed with the professionalism of us'
'1','331','being a member of a group of professionals that dealt with the families of such a tragic event and devloping my FLO experience'
'1','319','I&#039;m extremely proud
'1','317','Everyone I dealt with I believed went away feeling I had given them something'
'1','332','I am proud that although it was very disorganised at first
'1','328','Playing a small role in a major incident'
'1','335','Being able to be part of it and to deal with it making me a stronger person.'
'1','326','I am proud to be a FLO working for The Metropolitan Police for London. I am proud to be working along great professional and caring police officers and to work with the support agencies. It was great satisfaction when the surviors left feeling a bit better and that you had contributed to that. It was nice to meet lots of different people'
'1','329','I think I really helped some of the families I spoke to.  I was on occasions obstructed by the bureaoracy of the FLC&#039;s at Hendon.  They were sat in an office and had no contact with the victims &#039;families&#039; and made rash unfeeling decisions that would affect those bereaved for the rest of their lives.  I tried my best to make those terrible decisions better for the families.'
'1','317','yes but I beleive you have to be the right type of person and if thats how you feel should you really be an FLO!'
'1','319','I worked with and met some outstanding police collegues
'1','321','A sense of contribution and involvement. That I was actually able to help people that had lost their loved ones. That I knew that I had to just get on with it
'1','316','To have been a small part of a huge response.'
'1','334','That i was able to help and have some contact with victims and their families. Also one time talking to a family member about whether he should view the body of his relative and feeling as though he took my thoughts and ideas with him to make his decision. .'
'1','314','On seeing all of the FLO&#039;s brought together at very short notice with really no briefing pull together and work for the VIP&#039;s
'1','326','did you not feel that you helped anyone?'
'1','329','We made it work.  I m very proud of that.  It was hard and draining but very worthwhile.  I met people at their lowest ebb who I will not forget in along while.'
'1','319','Totally agree with that
'1','312','That I worked with a group of fantastic FLO officers
'1','332','the very fact that all of us wanted to help - despite everything else going on in our own lives - we wanted to do our bit'
'1','313','Ensuring that the uninformed person(s) at the end of the job
'1','317','I was proud to work for the MET and show we could all pull together
'1','331','qutie agree we had a fantastic team at the FAC that in true job style just got on with what we needed to do'
'1','315','do you do the job to get a pat on the back to make you feel good- I thought it was to help the families.'
'1','334','i enjoyed working with many of the flo&#039;s at the centre and think we made a great team.'
'1','321','I&#039;m sure they will not forget you
'1','329','That is very sad.  You should be proud of the work you did.  In this type of situation it is not about money.  For goodness sake
'1','316','Wholeheartedly agree! It would never have been as successful without us! It was US that it made it work
'1','331','I feel likewise. It is a great role to and one of imeasurable importance. I am very proud to be able to say I am a Family Liaison Officer.'
'1','311','Getting on an underground train so soon after the bombing!<br />Also... not knowing what my role would be at the family assistance centre
'1','328','We helped many people 
'1','336','I felt that even though most of the time we could not give the relatives good news they went away at last feeling they had some contact from police and that someone had listened to themand tried to get as much information to them as possible'
'1','334','I t was one of my first experiences as an flo and am very pleased to have been part of the team.'
'1','317','completely agree
'1','329','Well said.  I have never worked in a better team.'
'1','321','Everyone seemed to pull together
'1','336','I agree I got really fed up with people who had no contact with the public who seemed to be wanting a pat on the back for the admin in setting up the centre'
'1','316','I have bumped into somone I dealt with since and he told me that his view of he police has changed since. He now has more understanding of the types of things we have to deal with.'
'1','321','Small
'1','319','Being able to &quot;cry&quot; too. The family day on the Sunday
'1','329','I learnt so much about myself and general human nature and kindness.  It was a fantastic experience.'
'1','332','I agree.  I have never travelled on the tube as much as after this event - it makes you think of yourself
'1','313','FLCs at Hendon should be supportive around our needs and accept and understand the difference in your deployment to that of dedicated deployment to the family<br />balancing that some decisions- were by necessity harsh'
'1','312','In a situation when we are all working under pressure I think some of the people of the end of the phone forgot they were talking to another human being in an equally demanding role'
'1','321','They wanted someone just to care
'1','331','Yep I got on the tube that saturday night - and I felt amazingly self concious'
'2','0','Family Centre'
'1','317','was this the right name!!!'
'1','316','Incorrectly named.'
'1','338','Wrong name.  Not just for families.  Define families.  Not every family is the middle class stereotype of Thatchers Britain.'
'1','334','Why was there not a front page advert inevery paper telling people where it was and what it was for?'
'1','332','this should have been part of any policing plan for any major incident and implement asap for the families/relatives/friends'
'1','331','we were unclear about what the other agencies could offer...... VSS we all know about but TFL were fantastic with what they could offer'
'1','335','To include friends.'
'1','328','It should not have been called Family Assistance Centre. People who needed help did not attend until later thinking that it was only for families.'
'1','309','The title says it all
'1','334','no'
'1','313','Clear defined roles and responsibilities of the other agencies-<br />multi - agency briefing'
'1','309','lessons from tha FAC at 9/11 were not learned.'
'1','312','Clearly define ground rules this is a criminal investigation attending the centre assists the investigation and provides families with information.'
'1','322','Poorly advertised - could information have been put out at the location of the incidents
'1','313','poor media marketing of the centre'
'1','326','Gave the impression it was only for families. People more concerned over what it looked like not what it was about! Food rubbish (apart from the carrot cake) friction with westminster council - who was running the joint?! Not advertised
'1','338','Is it true that this was set up at the whim of the PM.  I felt it was something that Senior Management wanted to fail so that they would not have to do it again.  They failed we succeeded.  It worked and will definately have to be used again.'
'1','315','was set up in a hurry
'1','319','The location was good
'1','331','Why didn&#039;t DAC Clarke advertise the FAC when he gave the most prominant interview on the main news the second day. It would have also shown what the Police were doing for victims as well as the investigation !!!!!!'
'1','332','it is a police led response to a major incident - we should have had clear responsibility for setting it up and what it contained'
'1','331','which are ?'
'1','313','central government being unsure of the principles around the FAC'
'1','334','The multi agencies were great
'1','314','Should be a one stop shop for families the families should not ahve to go anywhere else in London to assist them in their greatest time of need.<br />Death certification.<br />Info on Identification of their relative.<br />Info on body release'
'1','336','A great idea - a single point of contact for families
'1','312','support services should have been briefed re police investigation needs and role of flo'
'1','322','Poor liason between the FAC and Casualty Bureau.'
'2','0','If the profession of Family Liaison is a learning profession
'1','313','should not have been a 24 hrs cntre..'
'1','309','Publicity a big issue.  Red Cross had to pay for some advertising space in the media
'1','338','The first centre QE Sports Hall was dreadful.  The second FAC at the RHH was brilliant.  Every family member that came away said they had be helped by the Police and other agencies.'
'1','335','Headline on the news.'
'1','334','why'
'1','338','Why wasn&#039;t it advertised better advertised.'
'1','331','totally agree - we were being given information that differed from minute to minute depending on who you spoke to'
'1','319','I did feel a couple of times though
'1','322','Incorrect phone numbers given. Inaccurate or minimal information received from doing computer checks later.'
'1','313','To focused on investigative needs (shrouded by secrecy-excuse)family needs as a consequence suffered-lack of information
'1','311','I was employed to the FAC on the day it opened.Families and friends were attending in the hope of finding their relatives alive. Although i see the purpose of bereavement agencies as important
'1','309','I will be guided by those that attended NY at the time and are fully versed in the triumphs and mistkes of that particular centre.'
'1','332','the families did not know what casualty bureau was for and would keep ringing and ringing them.  they felt we should have been dealing with this
'1','334','That with the right location and personnel it can be set up with in a matter of hours of any disaster or incident'
'1','338','Certain FLO&#039;s working with families didn&#039;t even know about the FAC.  I was even asked by one &#039;Are you a FLO?&#039; when trying to sort out a problem.  I think we were a vital resource to the families and we should have been advertised more.'
'1','316','A Centre is absolutely vital should
'1','317','TFL were fantastic and couldn&#039;t have done more for the people I dealt with'
'1','335','7/7 ASSISTANCE CENTRE'
'1','315','when we rang casualty bureau 
'1','319','I think there should have been posters adverstising the centre at the 4 different &quot;bomb&quot; sites and also all over the underground'
'1','336','I got the imrpession that no one at Casualty Bureau knew what we were or what we were doing but after a while it became apparent that flo&#039;s deployed to families had a lackof info about the centre too.  FLO&#039;s were ringing the helpline and we were telling them about the centre!!!!'
'1','338','The support line should have been sited at the same place as the FAC.  There were problems having the telephone line at the Red Cross and the FAC in another part of London.'
'1','313','not enough seemless linking to the other core sites that in effect would have provided more informattion to the families'
'1','326','Theses agencies should of been on the scene later - it was too early and they werent used until later anyway.'
'1','322','The street signs to the first FAC were adequate but those to the second were poor'
'1','309','felt we were looked at as almost second rate FLO&#039;s
'1','313','This is already in place and ready to be actioned'
'1','312','I was under the impression there was a binder on how to set up an FAC from lessons learnt in NY. Appears there wasn&#039;t'
'1','319','What about the fiasco over sending out the letters at the end
'1','338','We should be used as a resource immediatley should another incident happen.  We know how it works and have overcome the problems.  Use our experience again should it be needed.'
'1','328','The centre should of been set up earlier.'
'1','335','Whats best for the future?? Lets think now'
'1','314','Facilities for families anf FLo&#039;s to relax and eat
'1','338','Sometimes a power struggle between Westminster Council and the Police over who was in charge.  We just got on with the job. Who cares who is in charge.  Petty squabbles haqve no place in a situation like this.'
'1','334','quite agree on that one many looked down their noses at us working at the FAC'
'1','319','I agree with that
'1','313','agree.CCB FLO team not fully aware of FAC FLO role.'
'1','321','Timings(should have been implemented sooner with more support from the media in advertising it&#039;s excistence)
'1','322','There was no recognised format for us collecting information about people visiting the centre. We ended up designing our own forms.'
'1','326','Working with (******)'
'1','338','Expected phone call on the 7th Didin&#039;t come until Saturday.  Anticiaption.  Wanted to help and get involved.'
'1','338','Get to NSY within the hour.  How?'
'1','317','I totally agree!!'
'1','314','Lack of transport.'
'1','332','not advertised adequately'
'1','336','Lack of information around our role'
'1','314','No information'
'1','322','Mantaining credibility when asked straightforward questions but having no basic information or means of communicating the questions to obtain a meaningfull answer.'
'1','319','I totally disagree
'1','338','How to get to NSY.  Child care issues
'1','336','Long hours and having to sort out home life although the managment were very flexible around our needs'
'1','314','No proper R &amp; R facilities for FLO&#039;s'
'1','331','Easily the most difficult problem was that we had very little information if any at all and the fact SO13 were treaing us like children. On one occassion I dealt with a family who&#039;s loved ones personal effects had been identified at the scene and was told I was NOT to release this to the family. Isn&#039;t to ethos of FLO to be honest and build trust with our families ???????'
'1','316','Working with unknown people in very difficult circumstances.'
'1','332','agenda of senior mgmt'
'1','309','Initial location; lack of information; breaking down barriers with agencies'
'1','338','Briefing.  Or lack of it.  No conference facilities.  Moving rooms.  Glad to see Ron and we knew we were in the right place.'
'1','335','Welfare issues
'1','338','We relyed on our own knowledge of events to get us through the first few days.'
'1','338','The briefing of the D/Ch Supt was pityfull.'
'1','312','little information overcome by keeping in close contact with SMT and FLA&#039;s. Also trying to keep the moral of the FLO&#039;s intact so that they were performing to optimum level.'
'1','319','Working long hours was difficult. Having to maintain a relationship with my 2 children over the period was hard.'
'1','331','Yep as soon as the great man appeared we ken we were in the right place !!!'
'1','313','SO 13 - using terrorism- as a neans to providing no information'
'1','317','When finishing at 2330 how were we supposed to get home - BIG Brass got hotels again we felt under valued'
'1','338','We needed INFORMATION
'1','321','How I would get there myself. Checking travel
'1','316','Travelling to &amp; from work by tube train!'
'1','315','the FAC was set up to give people information.The first few days we didn&#039;t have any info to give 
'1','338','The FLO&#039;s and FLC&#039;s made it work.'
'1','334','The impact on my husbands role with the children and what  extra hours he had to put in at home
'1','326','Doing FLO for the 1st time and with know breifing no knowledge of forms etc and no information. Dealing with a family that had travelled down to London for information. And on that day her husband had been identified and we had to give the death message at the centre. This was hard. The family were also angry at the lack of information we had and why it took so long for answers - they thought we were lying and hiding answers!'
'1','314','FLO welfare was paramount for me.'
'1','313','assisted to put lots of things into the too difficult box'
'1','322','I missed out on having a holiday this summer - and when I got back to my office I couldn&#039;t book the time off I wanted because everyone else had got in first.'
'1','332','I was fully supported in being able to work part time at the FAC.   Not only by Steve/Joe but by my DI.   I did long hours on the days I did work and juggling this with my childcare did make the weeks I did my FLO job hard work  but I wanted to do my bit and was quite prepared to work hard'
'1','338','There were difficulties about Meeters and Greeters handing over to the FLO&#039;s.  This was ironed out after the first day and the FLO&#039;s met there own families at the door to the FAC.'
'1','334','not seeing the children for some days was difficult for me and them.'
'1','331','I thought we looked out for each other as a team - everyone had a kind of a bond and made sure each other had time when needed etc.....'
'1','336','I was lucky as my partner was at home at the time but had he not been it would have been impossible to work the hours and look after the kids'
'1','338','Security.  Searching
'1','309','although majority of FLO&#039;s at centre were well motivated and professional
'1','317','It was nice to see Rons friendly face and you could go to him for help and advice - felt confindent he was there.'
'1','321','Not being able to tell my family when I would be home
'1','316','Friends &amp; families were told to attend the Centre for information but we had none to give.'
'1','338','QE Queen Mother Sports Centre.  Bad location
'1','335','The fear and tension on the tube after a very long day at work.'
'1','311','trying to act as a professional towads the families wihout having ang information to give them. Being left alone with a family of 5 whose mother was obviously dead. A backlash from this family of anger and not understanding that  we had no iformation.'
'1','332','or wearing very inappropriate clothing'
'1','312','Supervising colleagues the same rank as me and thinking on my feet in a FLC role without the comfort of having had the correct training for that specific role.'
'1','319','One thing Commander Allen did do was set up an account for lunch at a local cafe
'1','338','Were told to not read newspapers in view of the public but that was our only source of information at the start.'
'1','316','We had no info to give and when we were given it
'1','304','SO 13 - using terrorism- as a neans to providing no information'
'1','335','drinking after work in order to relax and be able to sleep.'
'1','338','Not a lot of understanding from the boroughs..  When are you coming back? What are you doing.  I&#039;ve heard there is not going on?  comments like this are not helpful when you are working hard and long hours.'
'1','331','Having to be searched time and time again by the uniform officers even though they knew us had searched us previously and NO ONE appeared to be able to resolve this'
'1','322','I found that the uniform security presence at the second FAC was intimidating in the early weeks. The officers were not briefed (I believe) about what was going on inside and I did not find some of them to be particularly welcoming to the public who approached the doors
'1','332','communications - no other FLO dept appeard to know what FAC was for'
'1','334','some took more time than others!!'
'1','319','Saying that
'1','338','Bloody child care issues!  I don&#039;t have kids but I do have a family and a life and short notice affects me too!'
'1','321','That we exist
'1','312','General poor communcation within the organisation
'1','309','some of these problems were resolved by the appointment of Supt. Annette Weightman'
'1','317','Searching - why just because we were in plain clothes did our uniform collegues find it so apporpraite to keep on searching us!! again this made us feel 2nd class'
'1','334','nobody was discounting you they were asking about the effects generally on home life'
'1','311','Think a liason officer with some authority should be attached from SO13 to pass on the most up to date information. Also representatives from all the relevant parties ie TFL Media Press Liason.'
'1','331','This is a point that is VERY underrated. The cafe account was necessary and a great help in the early days'
'1','332','absolutely'
'1','319','Well no one said it didn&#039;t. The question was asked and we replied!'
'1','326','yum yum
'1','309','really??'
'1','331','I think this is a fabulous idea'
'1','322','I left the building at the end of one day to find
'1','339','Families knew their loved ones were dead
'1','328','Some people got above their stations !!! All trying to impress.'
'1','326','did they think it was necessary that the water bottles were put through there scanner!'
'1','334','wel ose the tone!!!'
'1','314','At least to have a plan. This plan may not survive contact but something to fall back on.'
'1','336','SO13 should be aware of our role and the fact that often we were the first point of contact for potential witnesses and well as dealing with victims and families'
'1','338','Resistance from the FLC&#039;s and FLO&#039;s with regard to the families.  Who gets a FLO and who doesn&#039;t.  If you don&#039;t fall within the usual &#039;family definition&#039; you don&#039;t qualify.  Totally against the FLO training.  A FLO told me &#039;Should I be the FLO for every shag she has had for the past 5 years!&#039;  This young lady had just lost her life and the FLO was moralising about her life.  As for the people the victim left behind
'1','314','A better understanding by other agencies of the working of FLO&#039;s.'
'1','313','More understanding of ACPO - level of training around the various other Police services- MPS is one cog in abig wheel.<br />Big is not always best'
'1','332','flo are part of the investigation team.  so we need to know what is going on. we must be part of a broad information sharing and de-brief for our views to be heard too'
'1','319','I think I thing I leant was to be totally flexible. We never knew from the offset what to expect. i knew it would be emotionally charged
'1','336','Now we know we can do it we should build on our experiences and should there be another major incidents an FAC should be set up as a metter of routine asap'
'1','314','Do not call FLo&#039;s at Hospitals that name it leads to confuse families as they think having met an FLo they are already deployed them.'
'1','322','Just because we are capable of getting by without proper preperation doesn&#039;t mean that we should always have to.'
'1','326','That we are an important role!'
'1','331','We should be treated as one of the key parts of any investigation. The fact that we are aware of intrinsic details does not mean we have to reveal them. Think trial I was told on my course. In due time it will be revealed that some of the infomation the &#039;MPS&#039; knew but did not want to release. How will the families feel then ????'
'1','311','Ron remembered me and called me by my first name!'
'1','317','make more people aware of the role of FLO
'1','312','To remain focused on what our role is and not to get upset
'1','339','With the bombings in NY and London
'1','338','I learnt so much it is difficult to put down in writing.  Seeing people at such a terrible time in their lives and being able to help.  What a privilege for me. Let the MPS move forward with this and use the experience that we have all gained.  Don&#039;t just deploy new people should this happen again.  What about a permanent team of dedicted FLO&#039;s for Major Incidents not just murder.'
'1','316','That we have to be flexible. The FLO course I attended was all about working with 1 family at a time but we all worked with many.'
'1','326','do you want a cuppa?!'
'1','338','Be Prepared!  Not &#039;if&#039; this will happen again but &#039;when&#039;.'
'1','335','Be prepared
'1','319','i agree. There wasn&#039;t one thing that was pink and fluffy! Dealing with people whose chidren have been blown apart
'1','332','also utilise those already trained and not just use those who have experience of a major incident.  a colleague had 2 families assigned to her
'1','336','The next rank was inthe sight of many senior officers'
'2','0','Bread crumbs in the forest'
'1','338','Continuing training of FLO&#039;s centrally not left to the FLC&#039;S on borough.'
'1','321','1/ Let people(other police depts
'1','334','Be flexible and be prepared to listen.'
'1','332','be flexible
'1','319','Be ready to deal with any thing. With people and their raw emotions. Be prepared for their to be a lot of the organistation &quot;glory hunting&quot; out of the centre.'
'1','335','Tip'
'1','336','expect the unexpected'
'1','317','Be felxiable
'1','338','Like all Police work this is not about being told to do this and that.  You have to use your initiative and get on with it.  Do your best and if you have been chosen correctly for the role of FLO you will get to the goal.'
'1','314','Be prepared for how emotionally and physically draining this work can be.'
'1','332','ask and you shall receive - eventually'
'1','326','A police memo pad saying&quot;Expect anything and everything
'1','309','A very detailed pack - never assuming that the next person will understand brief instructions.'
'1','322','Information about what services the other agencies can offer (and where they were in the first FAC). We had to find out for ourselves.'
'1','332','dont expect too much of yourself'
'1','335','this is how we did it
'1','317','Remember you are human'
'1','331','Be aware you will be dealing with some very distressed people.........Don&#039;t necessarily feel the need to fil in the gaps
'1','326','how much?!'
'1','319','Be ready to have no information
'1','313','For each unit working (e.g.FAC - CCB-etc)to have a full understanding of each others role - within mass disaster/terrorism'
'1','312','Flexible
'1','338','God it has been hard.  I could have cried with some of our families
'1','334','Listen'
'1','328','Be ready to deal with the varied emotions of people. Anger etc etc .Don&#039;t be put off. They don&#039;t mean it. It is grief.'
'1','338','Don&#039;t take it home with you.  Leave it at the door and pick it up the next day.'
'1','331','Be prepared to meet Tessa Jowell ALOT !!!!'
'1','336','Good idea'
'1','309','never lose your sense of humour.'
'1','339','keep an open mind
'1','332','the great thing about the MPS is the humour - let us hope that whatever situation we have to deal with we continue to be able to have a laugh and joke with our colleagues
'1','335','overtime'
'1','334','and get on the tele and do as many interviews as you can'
'1','338','Not everyone wants a sandwich and a cup of tea!'
'1','316','You are only human. Be prepared to feel emotional sometimes and that exhaustion
'1','319','I really did enjoy it. As mentioned I too met some really &quot;top&quot; officers who made the centre work. It was down to the leadership of Joe LENNON and us that made it work. And my god
'1','331','Don&#039;t forget to laugh..........and learn how to do Sudoko........I am now an expert !'
'1','317','keep smiling and wear trainers'
'1','313','understanding that even with set in stone plans and training - no two jobs are the same............flexibility'
'1','335','come on it is expected isn&#039;t it?'
'1','314','Fully support your FLO&#039;s in any way you can.Management need them they dont need management.'
'1','312','Be proud and enjoy the challenge and don&#039;t make a families day worse than it already is'
'1','326','No your not I am!'
'1','335','Am i ?'

'1','1150','communication is the key
'1','1157','what does that mean?'

'1','1168','Measurements of success must reflect the long term
'1','1103','we all do - not just man board'
'1','1118','This means that ethnic minority groups are given primacy
'1','1103','what do you mean'
'1','1169','i sometimes feel this silo nonsense is more myth than reality but i may be wrong.  there will always be tensions between competing priorities and there will not always be consensus. we must not overstate this as a problem more a reality of policing a great city .'

'1','1163','do you think the term &#039;troops&#039; connects us with the public?'

'1','1104','the seven priorities in the Corporate Strategy and the themes from the Service Review need to be scoped and implemented coherently.  Otherwise its a top level fight for resources which is unhealthy for the organisation.'
'1','1141','to much political correctness'

'1','1135','early definition of sucsess'
'1','1131','yes!'
'1','1110','This might be tough love - our staff have many benefits'
'1','1145','we need to recognise and reward (not necessarily cash) good individual perfromance that supports the corporate strategy vision. This success needs to  be highly visible.'
'1','1173','careful handling here - not everyone is going to stay with the mps'
'1','1156','Greater flexibility in mamaging resources and measuring success-% change in annual crime figures  is  a poor indicator of what is being delivered or the qualty of service-longer term approach needed to encourage committment and consistency'

'1','1152','Good idea'
'1','1126','The dissemination of messages seem to fall down as they go across the Service. There needs to be face to face briefings from the central offices to the local boroughs. This is the ONLY way to make officers and local police staff feel &#039;safe&#039; and support the change.'
'1','1188','We need to reposition the police officer as a genuine community based problem solver and facilitator.  This may mean that the SN role should actually be expressed as a commitment to put in place properly trained and supported teams - not simply the resence of the teams.'
'1','1106','Because its fun and exciting. We need to create a new focus for colleagues as to what is important'
'1','1168','Replace 80% I call standard with more meaningful charter measures around front counter services
'1','1113','we have had several years of dismissing corporate strategy type activity from the very top - will have to work doubly hard now
'1','1161','the point is that we are the lowest in the country re satisfaction and confidence.  we may think we are good but the public don&#039;t think so to the same degree.  we are like the old fashioned medical consultant who knows best for the patient

While I am content to deliver my version of the coroporate strategy I need some well articulated guidance so I deliever mesages in a common style that fits with what is expected.

The quality and in particular clarity of information given to middle managers is crucially important. Get it right first time and we delver what you want.'

'1','1138','How does it become stronger - you have used the word 3 times but have not explained how?'
'1','1103','every business moves on. if they don&#039;t they go bust. if we are not to become stale we need to find new and cheaper ways of working. to do that there will regrettably be casualties. but if we don&#039;t we will become less effective and more remote'
'1','1172','move on and become a part of the team

'1','1119','whathappens in this realignment to the older staff
'1','1104','educate staff that it is not all about them. It&#039;s about what we do for others'
'1','1161','because the messages we send our response team colleagues are all about getting there quickly
'1','1151','Hear Hear - but are we bold enough to identify where and how real success is found - might be uncomfortable for some.'
'1','1141','I hope the next phase is better than the first part.'
'1','1103','we already have too much dead wood. we have such a low turnover. we need an injection of adrenaline'
'1','1120','Stop escalating upwards accountability levels
'1','1150','the language used must be inclusive we will deliver

'1','1128','no redundancies is a big promise in the context of creating service centres can you make that promise to the hr community?'
'1','1096','here here'
'1','1162','the values statement is good but rather long and not in plain enough English therefore it is not memorable or easy to communicate right across the 45k staff base.'
'1','1166','Qualitative PIs and links to reward.<br />Come out of PNB'
'1','1169','this is why they are ring fenced for that very reason but already many want to reduce that protection all of us must defend their role which will be challenged in the immediate future'
'1','1123','We do know what our job is'
'1','1172','i expect the centre to really focus on neighbourhoods
'1','1106','ervice centres are a good opportuntity but also a threat to efficiency if we get it wrong.  The focus must be to improve efficiency rather than save money.  Hopefully we can improve efficiency and save money providing this work is not rushed through'
'1','1126','i completely agree. this is a business and &#039;jobs for life&#039; help neither the business or the delivery. it produces complacency.'
'1','1114','but that is what you have to do: people are being moved in order to create the SN teams that the citizens want and that is the corporate decision which this room must support'
'1','1168','We must be honest and tell our staff exactly how it is
'1','1163','it makes decisions in the knwlege of the full implications and within the framework of the strategy'
'1','1153','It is invidious to say there are no cuts only redirection when the resource being redirected is currently in police staff functions which will have to reduce to pay for other functions such as PCSOs. For the people involved they do face the prospect of being cut - don&#039;t dress up the reality'
'1','1141','much more of this'
'1','1103','know what you mean. less monitors would save a fortune'
'1','1119','those teams are critical to delivery
'1','1137','Does this mean we should be priortising our activity?  Should not the Corporate Strategy and Management Board provide the steer as to what is important and what is not?'
'1','769','Perhaps in the short term we can&#039;t do both.  I do believe that providing a better service to the public would make people feel safer - irrespective of crime levels'
'1','1171','The role of the centre is reduced but the areas that it keeps it will have a real role to control systems such as intelligence and to ensure compliance with corporate approaches'
'1','1126','trust managers on OCUs to deliver. This implies a degree of risk but it is the only way to deliver'
'1','1161','absolutely right.  we need to start putting the measures of the things the public think are important about quality of service
'1','1149','have you not heard of re-training?'
'1','1108','has the idea of custody clusters consider the rights of the disabled appropriate adult or legal representative'
'1','1096','get out of offices - walk around - and encourage private offices to be lean and customer focused'
'1','1098','we have to take a problem solving approach to the policing issue which addresses the needs of the customer at the same time. It is not about more money and resources but a process.'
'1','1163','we sort out clear accountibilities and responsibilities for activity &amp; delivery'
'1','1106','must understand detail of what HR &amp; FR deliver on OCUs - much is locally delivered personal service that is valued by staff'
'1','1105','both have equal importance'
'1','1173','centre must deliver expert prompt advice to front line managers - no fudging or delay-not the experience now'
'1','1147','Save a fortune in travel &amp; subs!'
'1','1103','look around you at the successful businesses. you may find this results in better support services'
'1','1128','new and cheaper ways of working means more automation can this sit with the widening mission and values of personal contact with the community can the neighbourhhood teams deliver in this environment'
'1','1148','introduce very visible accountability to the support services'
'1','1150','a concern regarding leading change
'1','1171','If we did this right we would reduce duplications. Most of which have happened as each OCU/business group has designed what it thinks is needed without asking what else already exists. There is no need to control assets to get the result you want.'
'1','1160','Please think again about shared service centres.  If you take the personal touch out of HR
'1','1116','Recognise that not all the customers are willing customers
'1','1103','yes but a van driver may not want to become a clerk. so lets not fudge it and offer choices'
'1','1108','We always talk about savings where is the ROI [Return on investment] appraisal and bus&#039;benefits realisation plan from the service review'
'1','1096','I might even have the most appropriate skills!'
'1','1092','And risk management skills'
'1','1163','does everyone understand what their job is?'
'1','1106','but not wards'
'1','1136','fouc on performance and inspection? plese remember that whether its formal or not it still takes immense time and energy tp prepare and deal with the process which is often counter productive'
'1','1155','The Centre must empower staff to take responsibility and deliver a service they are proud of.'
'1','1104','manage the strategy. Don&#039;t talk about it and then put it on the shelf you have as much responsibility as everybody else'
'1','1152','Noy all managers are signed up to improvements
'1','1118','Not to post capable and effective Police Officers to Metcall.  It is not an effective use of resources.  Put officers back out on the streets and let the police staff resources the telephone calls centres.'
'1','1188','my expectation is that MB will start to talk about information rather than intelligence which is just one policing purpose for which information is used'
'1','1096','what about ICG - mixed messages'
'1','1175','to all parts of the oranisation.  This continuation of an us and them mentality that is not helpful'
'1','1095','you do not know the current costs of the the current transaction costs
'1','1109','Too many discussions about organisational change where senior people refuse to give up any BWT because they would then have fewer than the next area/person. Size is not everything. Very little effort to really examine why the current BWT exists
'1','1119','where is prevention
'1','1148','Speak to any senior manager in Barclays and they will say it has failed'
'1','1153','exactly. need to understand exactly how we do things at present and what gaps are filled by local staff because of failures in current processes. Contracts need to be fit for purpose eg. a stationary contract that does next day delivery not next week.'
'1','1121','o have true customer focus we need a professional approach to actually finding out whatimpact we curently have.  We THINK we know what they want but do we really?'
'1','1108','Are we learning from other businesses that have devolved and centralised function like a see-saw. There is a danger if we get it wrong it will costs us more in the long run'
'1','1133','we also require some consistencies across business groups in terms of renumeration of senior staff and their responsibilities'
'1','1094','I will continue to liaise and have constructive dialogue with all business groups encouraging and empowering BME staff to take personal responsibility in effecting change. My strategic approach for the MPS to reflect the community we serve incorporates the mission for change.'
'1','1153','and sanctions'
'1','1103','costs???? Could be worse. Could move the support services to other part sof the uk or even overseas'
'1','1132','much more clarity over who is LEADING the information agenda. Is it Ailsa Beaton or Alan Brown'
'1','1125','where does information stop and intelligence begin?'
'1','1161','we need to get the balance right - experienced police staff
'1','1136','how true!'
'1','1121','o assist with the spread of good practice'
'1','1144','perhaps we need to benchmark with and take lessons fron other service industries in the private sector that have achieved this e.g. hotel chains
'1','1096','hear hear'
'1','1171','Please ensure that we speak to senior personnel within the Lord Chancellor&#039;s dept.
'1','1120','Centrally managed performance data needs to reflect B/OCU needs ie detailed sub-unit information - otherwise B/OCUs will simply have to reinvent performance units by another name.'
'1','1175','and across the police/police staff divide'
'1','1108','what about the value statement
'1','1148','We will need to ensure serious crime falls not just criminal damage and anti social behaviour'
'1','1126','I agree. Local delivery is at the heart of the new aproach
'1','1150','the centre should assist with the speed of change for example there are many staff  who are on restricted that want to leave
'1','1153','&quot;Personal&quot; doesn&#039;t necessarily need to be co-located'
'1','1096','and recognise information mgt skills'
'1','1170','what role do you have in this cascading of information? as a senior manager is it not best for you to keep your people in touch with the direction of the organisation?'
'1','1142','This shows a need to look at the MPS as a whole.  Greater efficiencies and effectiveness can be achieved by removing duplication.  There then needs to be a redirection of the freed-up staff to other areas which do not have sufficient resources.  Whilst there may be a reduction in staff performing the same functions it is not meant to &#039;cut&#039; but improve the quality of the function or service being delivered.'
'1','1134','be both patient and impatient'
'1','1141','This the sort of simplistic statement arising from service review based upon little or no undrstandingof the PNB its previous organisation the police council or the wider political picture let alone the legal staus of PNB.  The off the cuff comments of this type shows most clearly the weakness of the service review in the area of workforce modernisation'
'1','1123','Yes - Property Serbives are working closely with the Custody Directorate to get this right.  By building modern felxible clusters we can exit the old Victorian buildings as AB had just spoken about'
'1','1166','then remove the managers'
'1','1095','we need a new solution to the old problem of what to do with managers /leaders who fail
'1','1152','Custody clusters must be close to patrol sites to make it work'
'1','1104','estate strategy is interesting. It takes months to get the most minor works started
'1','1134','continue to have courage to say outloud what others may still be reluctant to say'
'1','1103','agree....ish. If we are a modern organisation thn think about joint skills. To make a better police manager
'1','1153','We do have information on the costs of processing invoices
'1','1147','IF the estate strategy has not delivered in the past 10 yrs (PFI costs) how are we going to move forward with a PSD who are demoralised &amp; always teeming &amp; lading with insufficient resources.'
'1','1161','this is some times difficult to do if staff are unable to fulfil thier role. There needs to be approprite support and supervision to ensure that we have an proffessional and effective service. Howevere we cannot messure success if we cannot monitor it.'
'1','1106','some believe that disenfranchisement understanding and dealing with it has nothing to do with CT and our operational response this is dangerous and a significant challenge to our safety.'
'1','1150','too many senior officers are concerned regarding their own career profile
'1','1132','that will be a first'
'1','1123','Is is what they want or what they need'
'1','1163','i agree'
'1','1094','To be accessible
'1','1103','personal is not where i see some of our hr officers'
'1','1128','agree but if the first cuts are within the police staff numbers then this situation will remain a high risk'
'1','1136','one thing i have not heard is about the snt locally driven priorities our targets are becoming too top dowm removing capacity to delivery at a truely local level'
'1','1109','We heard a story from the MPA about a police officer helping to change a tyre - made a fantastic impression on him
'1','1137','Don&#039;t just tell me - inspire me'
'1','1152','Policy takes a minimum of 13 weeks to develop
'1','1163','how do we distinguish between intelligence &amp;information?'
'1','1106','Estate modernisation - great idea but experience with delivering SNT bases suggests beyond scope of MPS at present'
'1','1129','But it is  for SNT'
'1','1175','are we ready to accept a new approach to poor performers - in other organisation those who perform stay and those who don&#039;t have to leave'
'1','1121','How do we get rid of thosenot performing.'
'1','1161','we do but under performing ocu&#039;s need support to improve if they cannot then ocu commanders need to be removed not promoted'
'1','1095','please
'1','1110','really happy to deliver but need the centre to clear the path. i.e. if we are to modernise our workforce then get us out of the pnb'
'1','1149','I take it that it will cater for all staff ...'
'1','1171','Share the responsibility of finding innovtive ways forward with my staff  - they usually have the best ideas !!!!'
'1','1156','Decisions need to be made fast efore we loose the best staff and disilusionment sets in for others'
'1','1142','At a time of such change should we be decreasing our internal capability.  External consultants are far more expensive and lack organisational knowledge'
'1','1112','There are plenty of new people out there!  It is bizarre to thin we should keep the same workforce for 30 years.'
'1','1145','Corporate strategy is about making long-term decisions not short-term ones regardless of the budget pressures.'
'1','1131','Is this a good method interacting. I spend all day fending off e-mails and now I&#039;m interacting with my senior colleagues by typing. So much for networking. I&#039;d like to engage in debate'
'1','1151','evidence of best value should drive PSD performance eg entering into contracts with no penalty clauses for slippage'
'1','1116','By ensuring that Professional Standards  bonds with &#039;Together&#039;'
'1','1106','This right. The abolition of OCU units leaves us unable to conduct performance reviews.  Centrally a blip in performance will be idetified but we need staff to help us sort out why.'
'1','1104','I need to understand what the centre means
'1','1113','you talked a lot about internal change and the changing face of policing. Do Londoners want a chnging face
'1','1109','information of all sorts can be turned into intelligence
'1','1103','decisions are taken and we want to keep our beat hr people'
'1','1127','The removal of Police stations from communities will have a negative impact on local delivery and re-assurance!'
'1','1152','How will the centre develop and implement changes when some HQ teams are being significantly reduced? Madness'
'1','1155','Less MB INFIGHTING'
'1','1160','Of course it does!  An example - both commendation ceremonies and absence management strategies are more successful and have a better impact on morale if the staff organising them know their people well.'
'1','1173','people need to know exactly what these will be - staff will be asking and we do not hav aclear picture/srtucture yet'
'1','1161','or DAC Bryan or the Deputy Commissioner?'
'1','1133','Fine
'1','1168','Time deadlines on support functions must be strictly adhered to
'1','1103','give me an example that you have witnessed'
'1','1123','Customer focus could lead to the euphamism &quot;a camel is a horse designed by committee&quot; Whilst it is important that we listen and respond
'1','1146','at a time when we about a huge part of our corporate memory i find this bizarre!'
'1','1125','reorganise to be efficient and effective and them make redundant those who don&#039;t fit the roles'
'1','1112','This is about increasing our presence - not removing police stations.  Find out about what the Estates Strategy means.'
'1','1142','Service review have assinged leads for the various strands but who will lead on the 7 corporate priorities?'
'1','1117','The centre should plan the changes required in a coherent and coordinated way
'1','1150','an organisation that looks  after its staff is more likely to look after its customers.'
'1','1149','And the more we move that way the more we will need to listen and amend our plans to meet local need and needs of partners -- are we really ready to do that?'
'1','1148','it must be relevant to our experience of working life'
'1','1157','ok then lets see the willingness to do this - perhaps we should publicise the first member of management board to say ok i am prepared to accept that i have to do soemthing different even if it means that i have to give up some of my power base - the commissioiner needs EVERYONES support and that icludes his top team.'
'1','1115','If Stephen Rimmer is going to be leading on Service Review
'1','1161','there is a system being piloted which will deliver this I do not think there is any plan to remove MIUs until it is in place'
'1','1151','Staff morale is not helped by disloyalty at ACPO ranks at the centre - &#039;together&#039; should be demonstrated at the top levels of the organisation.'
'1','1133','We have had great support from PSD for SN'
'1','1147','We need PSD to become a cohesive outfit'
'1','1192','we need to ensure that the organisation is capturing &#039;what works&#039; as well as what does not. Internal and external'
'1','769','Is this comment just about police staff? Are there no &#039;dead wood&#039; police officers and if so how can we make these redundant?'
'1','1121','f we had a modern pay structure for officers we could avoid the over use of non warranted staff - this would then mean we could afford to keep officers and retain the flexibilty to respond to crisis - who will lead this'
'1','1095','that is just the kind of blinkered arrogance i meant'
'1','1152','have we not done what we said we wouldn&#039;t i.e sleep walk into delivering this stuff with the same resources?'
'1','1159','Learn from the past to inform the future.  Use the expereince and knowledge within and outside the service to find the path.  Not rush in to decisions as they affect peoples careers and lives.  Value our people.'
'1','1125','these are PM skills!!!!'
'1','1127','&quot;Walk the Talk&quot; and listen/respond to individuals concerns re the proposed changes and do not just do it to them!'
'1','1126','if you are proposing to take away HR
'1','1129','strategy asks for citzen focus
'1','1110','Take care with year on year success (Commissioner speaking about crime reduction in HT).  This sort of comparison can come back and bite next year.  More long term crime comparison may better reflect the community as well as focussing on what they say.'
'1','1133','admitting we got it wrong is important'
'1','1190','How do we make police officers redundant?'
'1','1144','We need to run the police service more like a business as per the private sector'
'1','1103','step into a new way of working.'
'1','1103','.......meaning whT??'
'1','769','Having a good HR manager is a key resource
'1','1103','MEANING WHAT?'
'1','1190','Absolkutely agree'
'1','1133','hard to witness behind closed doors'
'1','1104','there is no acknowleged top level &#039;business&#039; forum to drive through business change and the right resource allocation mechanism'
'1','1173','I am not clear what the service centres will include.  Has this been defined?'
'1','1156','Right people right place right atitude-how will we reward those managers who deliver above those who exist/maintain the status quo?  How will MB demonstrate its trust in local senior managers to deliver?<br />We are bing asked to deliver as private industry but have few of the tools-rewards and sanctions/ability to loose ineffective/inefficient staff etc.'
'1','1192','the language used is wrong. Delivering what the customer wants is performing!'
'1','1150','the current PDR system for TP OCU Commanders are purely focussed on 3 crime reduction and one TNO detection
'1','1191','The proposed leaders of the Service Review clearly do not represent the fundamental need for diversity.in the MPS. Visibly the &quot;leaders&quot; comprise less than 10 members of ethnic minority members of the MPSv and an apprant token presence perhaps one or two women per table.<br />The key speakers are nearly all white men. Plus ca change
'1','1193','we are an information rich organisation but particularly poor in making this available to our staff. We need a knowledge management strategy that uses effective communication to achieve a knowledge sharing situation'
'1','1138','the energy levels in this room
'1','1149','and they charge you to tell you the time'
'1','1164','professional support and guidance not rule enforcement'
'1','1192','a great way to stiffle debate'
'1','1173','Committed to culture change but uncertain about how to make it happen'
'1','1133','and tend to find more work for themselves. paralysis by analysis'
'1','1145','Need to ensure that all staff are given a clear understanding of what it really means
'1','1128','are the savings real - will they ever happen'
'1','1163','A comprehensive series of briefings accross all parts of the OCU and partners. What would be of value would be a single corporate product.'
'1','1193','consider why the Metro
'1','1152','How will the centre develop and implement change if the resouces (staff) have been reduced? madness'
'1','1160','Influencing how PPAF is constructed is critical. We have not  had a high enough profile
'1','1173','need confidence that difficult decsions will be taken including around staffing issues'
'1','1127','Claer and visible leadership.  Centre needs to ENGAGE with the process and be part it'
'1','1190','We need to recognise who our customers are. Many support services are divorced from front line policing
'1','1193','The strategy needs to be in a simple language that everyone understands. we need to make it real for people so that everyone knows how they contribute.'
'1','1124','We cannot concentrate on outcomes when we dont know what the constraints are. We want to act like business but we are the only business that sets strategy and targets without knowing what our resources are. Citizen focused outcomes will always be more than we can expect to deliver. This is why strategy fails.'
'1','1146','Clarity of message. Significant concern that Mid Term Financial Plan cuts will be misinterpreted by workforce as an SR measure.  Don&#039;t use SR as a trojan horse for other necessary unpopular measures; it will challenge the integrity of SR.'
'1','1133','Like ENRON?'
'1','1190','Why is &#039;old&#039; corporate strategy being dismissed? If the Met is so good
'1','1190','From the shop floor'
'1','1133','speak for yourself'
'1','1190','visit more police staff centres'
'1','1124','We need convincing business cases on what the benefits of these changes are.  They are words at the moment we need to know detailed savings and details on  where these savings will be used. Only then will our people be convinced.'
'1','1127','Isn&#039;t the resourcing and funding of a trerrorists incident/investigation a national responsibility??'
'1','1095','greater inflence at Govt level
'1','1106','unfortunately my experience of the MPS is such that if you don&#039;t control the assets you don&#039;t get the service you want.'
'1','1094','Not to revert to short term panics over small blips in crime figures that devalue the longer gameplan. Witness the beginning of this year when burglary and street crime rose and the &quot;widening mission&quot; became very narrow and we were micro- managed from the top down'
'1','1115','Apart from Management Board of course !!'
'1','1106','has anyone successfully challenged poor performance in the MPS with its hugely bureaucratic and rule based approached to people management'
'1','1128','is stephen rimmer going to lead on the morris observation around police regulation framework and modernising this into employment law framework? we are now looking at another bureauoctic layer of police officer ie police trainees on contracts'
'1','1147','Too much of gravy train mind set.'
'1','1148','where are the plans for co=location/multi agency one stop shops for delivering best service to community-especially for vulnerable victims'
'1','1106','The success of 7/7 was delivered by empowered
'1','1108','there are a lot of officers in non police jobs who would give anything to be able to do a worthwhile fullfilling job
'1','1159','lets start by giving managers some management training'
'1','1148','additional funding and resource committment through LAAs for PPO schemes'
'1','1145','That wouldn&#039;t leave many!'
'1','1115','You can take a horse to water - but you can&#039;t stop it using cliches.'
'1','1145','That it leads and takes the tough decisons i.e. stop putting officers in charge of projects they do not have the skills to deliver'
'1','1158','there needsto be an understanding of SN at all levels of BOCUs
'1','1133','not true. ask the victims. they want a fast response that meets their needs'
'1','1171','We need to work better with each other but our focus must always be on what the people of London/Uk are going to get in terms of service.'
'1','1188','meaning properly accountable for spend
'1','1125','To lead and direct
'1','1119','continuity - management
'1','1171','This can be prepared bassed on todays presentation?'
'1','1151','acceptance that troop on the ground will not understand or accept that this is the right way forward. Their views do not involve strategies etc but the day to day demands of response policing'
'1','1194','To critically analyse why such similar initiatives and aspirations in the past have not succeeded'
'1','1104','scope of what functions we intend to deliver in a Service Centre needs to be considered carefully'
'1','1117','sharing of good practice and quickly. Often find start doing something and then find change from centre upsets the apple cart'
'1','1117','Feedback and support'
'1','1118','BOCU needs are often divorced from the corporate information requirements required of external stakeholders. BOCUs need to recognise that failing to play as a team causes enormous difficulties for the Met. All levels must play as team.'
'1','1159','my staff have an office in a basement with no windows
'1','1126','primacy of deliververy is the boroughs- why are we taking issues away from the boroughs?'
'1','1188','It depends what they are doing in those offices.  If it adds value and is derived from their experience then the Service benefits.'
'1','1192','How were we allowed / or did we allow ourselves to let the budget become so unbalanced?'
'1','1103','YOU MISUNDERSTAND HOW IT WILL WORK'
'1','1096','Is the only way to stop recruiting?'
'1','1161','because the mps have mis-managed it for the last 170 years'
'1','1103','have you not had any. i would be surprised'
'1','1096','Surely not by seting business group against business group!'
'1','1112','Someone really needs to explain why we are in this financial position.  It is not clear'
'1','1175','we could start by identifying what they are now'
'1','1192','No
'1','1150','we need to increase police activity regarding confiscation
'1','1112','I agree.  We need to learn the lessons and not just plough on.'
'1','1132','we need to ensure that we can turn the tap back on given the demographics of the next 5-7 yrs'
'1','1148','By learning lessons from past failures to set budgets realistically and consult with budget holders as part of the process'
'1','1125','clear out the silos and duplication across the whole organisation
'1','1112','I agree too.  Staff will play their part if they understand why'
'1','1188','all information is intelligence.It&#039;s just the use you put it to.'
'1','1096','Major delivery programmes must be properly costed and resourced
'1','1140','it is about time HR/Finance/DOI/Resources  were intergrated into single facilities management structure. IT allows us to do this'
'1','1103','the thing that is not helping is overprotection of budgets and poor forecasting. we must be farmore robust'
'1','1104','why do we promote people and then keep them in post'
'1','1161','Absolutely.  We need the performance (organisation) and performance (personal) linked up with the PDRs
'1','1168','Central look at LAA&#039;s.  Allow local flexibility and leadership but give a realistic framework for engagement.  Viz. Combined activities may need charging out of certain police time in partnership activities.  Close central eye on performance reward grants both from LPSA&#039;s and new LAA&#039;s may bring extra added value or cost replacement.'
'1','1192','yes-   evidence-based prioritisation is crucial'
'1','1132','ensure that the estate and infrastructure costs are reduced early within the service review'
'1','1103','....it will mean redundancy'
'1','1096','This is exactly why we need programme management skills - they are different from operational policing skills'
'1','1125','absolutely right'
'1','1155','Do we truly know where the money is and who has authority to spend'
'1','1175','what do you mean?'
'1','1191','how much does each Borough spend year on year.?<br />Have we ever attempted to quantify the cost of crime prevention strategies as compared to the cost of detection?<br />Does the MPS Property Services Department discuss disposals with the local Borough and the Crime Reduction Partners to identify the local  needs with Projects with young people?<br />Does the Property Services Department identify how they can facilitate the work of the Safer Neighbourhood teams.?'
'1','1148','Start with top down management review why 5 ACs as well as directors replacing ACs.'
'1','1163','Ask government for the &pound;70m for Op Theseus'
'1','1095','and put where
'1','1146','I thought that kiosk was dismantled last week?'
'1','1104','why do we continue to allow poor manages to manage budgets - replace those who fail to come in on budget'
'1','1168','Invest to save leading to possible capital borrowing and then divestment of assets.'
'1','1150','There is enormous potential for savings without pain by just cutting down on wastage; cut the over ordering mentality 
'1','1145','In order to balance resources we need to make senior members of staff truly accountable for spend and ensure that all spends are truly based on need and driving the business.  This means less &quot;ego spending&quot;
'1','1192','we should not leap to restructuring as the automatic answer. Changing culture and how we do things is just as important as the structure'
'1','1149','Where does that stop? Does each agency charge for their time? LAA&#039;s will increase expectation on delivery from us.'
'1','1104','you pay a higher rate for the same piece of work'
'1','1169','increase income overall not just poca but bocu cdrp funding plus charging for services we are often good to deliver a service but not to send the bill'
'1','1192','not just cost
'1','1115','It&#039;s now been converted into the Borough Commander&#039;s office.'
'1','1153','We grew too quickly to satisfy political aims around police numbers and are now reaping the full cost impact'
'1','1096','Do we know our age profile?  How much of a contribution will normal retirement make?'
'1','1119','We need to xplore the partnerships - ie ODPM neighourhood renewal
'1','1132','up to date accurate financial data presented in ONE clear doc would enable decision making to a far better standard'

'1','1163','theres a lot of picking on MB here - they want the MPS to succeed.  Lets all get on with it'
'1','1118','You are old fashioned !  Jump into this millenium.'
'1','1159','Iin fact all members of staff must challenge unethical behaviour. Unfortunately the culture still exists where staff are too frightened to do so for fear of reprisal or being victimised. I have experience of this personally and the managements willingness to turn a blind eye was nothing short of disgraceful.'
'1','1166','The &#039;moment of truth&#039;
'1','1163','this is irelevant rubbish grow up'
'1','769','What does this mean? there are a large numbers of police staff who deliver a key operational role.'
'1','1194','Listen
'1','1096','Do we still need an officers&#039; mess?  Surely not.  All staff may have a need to entertain colleagues and partners - not just senior colleagues.  And it might save some money.  And the staff could be redirected to feeding service delivery colleagues'
'1','1118','Being old fashioned is one of the biggest problems for the Met
'1','1151','At last
'1','1103','4 actually'
'1','1152','Deal with bullies'
'1','1156','How do we recognise and reward those who are willing to get on and do their job well instead of pursuing promotion .  I would suggest that at the moment we dont do it very well!'
'1','1194','May be it will be forever thus - police officers are from venus and police staff are from Mars or is it the other way around'
'1','1145','The organisation must seriously address the issue of bullying
'1','1159','Many of whom seem to get promoted'
'1','1172','value and support inovation and diveristy of thouhgt'
'1','1133','well said'
'1','1148','we are ahead of many organisations...........stop beating ourselves up'
'1','1152','Past leadership set the scene that said bullying was OK!  Now it is different but we need to repair the MPS'
'1','1163','and this has been the case for years. Is the MPS ready to address this key public service issue - it must'
'1','1157','that  also applies to those below acpo as well--it  is easy to knock others'
'1','1130','Some got the very top job!'
'1','1153','This happens a lot.'
'1','1155','There must be an alternative to promote and move. Different kinds of reward.'
'1','1112','Does that then apply to everyone in the room?'
'1','1168','Response teams must be promoted from the basements of police stations away from the sewage outlets and the boiler rooms.  Maybe they would leave the police stations feeling valued.'
'1','1162','On the theme of a &#039;civilian&#039; police force
'1','1156','Do you still have one?  W e don&#039;t on boro'
'1','1145','Values and behaviours must be part of the performance review and affect how you are rewarded. If you deliver but do not live the values this is not acceptable or excusable!'
'1','1119','Feedback - the 360 degree process is a salutory lesson for everyone
'1','1108','I totally agree you hear this in certain quarters and it goes against the ethos of TeamMet where we should all help others and where we have problems collectively work together to resolve issues - not use the sacking or transfer solution.'
'1','1096','Stop bullying and undermining each other.'
'1','1103','i agree'
'1','1117','believe many of us do
'1','1148','need to define bullying it is probably a perception more than reality of leadership style'
'1','1159','You&#039;re assuming that the public can find a front office that is actually open when they need it!'
'1','1132','given the future we need to to able to take more well judged risks without &#039;risk&#039; of condemnation. This is a great enabler to understand what could work in a different way'
'1','1096','Two at NSY.'
'1','1194','Engage our people in the process of change. Communicate with them
'1','1140','integrity has been ditched'
'1','769','Whilst people admire our operational effectiveness
'1','1161','but how can our staff who are disavantaged by discrination ever be in a postition to play on an equal playing field
'1','1149','have a look around the room'
'1','1145','Please do not suggest 360 degree feedback - this organisation is not mature enough for real honest feedback. Telling your boss what you really think of them is not a position to go for straigh off.'
'1','1152','when our staff hate the idea of coming to work or working for a particular boss
'1','1160','Very interested in not treating people differently because of rank or grade. Are we really ready for this?'
'1','1153','This won&#039;t ever be done as there are too many who cover up the casualties and damaged people
'1','1136','i would welcome more time to be visible and lead but the org drive and demand often prevenst this'
'1','1103','keep in perspective'
'1','1095','it undoubtedly would require some very senior officers to examine their own behaviour'
'1','1138','So when will the center stop pulling in the poor BCU commander when his/her crime rises and compliment them for how well their community supports them'
'1','1096','Working with staff support associations will help - it&#039;s one of the things they are there for'
'1','1157','tosh'
'1','1133','absolutely. need to have an organisation where getting more metal on shoulders is not a sole career goal.'
'1','1128','why what has made you feel like that is the staff association helping - opefning doors?'
'1','1194','Don&#039; be too quick to don the sack cloth. Many organisations would consider us to be good.'
'1','1162','Here is a golden opportunity to demonstrate that the MPS is a &#039;civilian&#039; police force as espoused in the Commissioner&#039;s speech.  Close the AC&#039;s Mess down.'
'1','1150','managers must also be empowered to ask difficult performance questions holding people to account without being labelled a bully'
'1','1119','there is a fine line between bullying and being held to account
'1','1108','We will not get colleagues to be honest and open if there is a threatening culture around failure. Failure is often a team issue rather than a single individual. Blaming and acting inappropriately against an apparent colleague who maynot be performing for some reason is not acting to our values.'
'1','1133','key to the executive washroom died a death in other sectors many years ago'
'1','1148','whats your definition of old fashioned'
'1','1192','Not exactly a symbol
'1','1157','evidence please'
'1','1145','All managers must take greater responsibility for dealing with those members of staff who have no interest in contributing.  Greater use of inefficiency regs and lobbying needed to create Police Regulations which really enable staff to be dealt with effectively.  At present good staff can have no confidence that their inefficient colleagues are being dealt with.'
'1','1117','Need to incorporate this in appraisal system and objectives'
'1','1096','Some of us very experienced colleagues rememeber this being an issue in the Priority Programmes back in 1984.  Spooky!'
'1','1131','Whose? I have faith in the integrity of the vast majority of my colleagues. Have you ditched your integrity and if so why?'
'1','1171','When will those boroughs who are trying to tackle this problem
'1','1095','the corporate stretegy of the mid 1990s was explicit in saying that middle managers must challenge the culture to find better and smarter ways of working - but there was great resistence to anyone who actually tries it - we need to grow up'
'1','1096','this needs to be rewarded/sanctioned apporpriately'
'1','1140','i agree ....'
'1','1191','Significantly improve and modernise the initial courses for Ps and Insp. Get in early and get it right.'
'1','1132','promotion or any posting should be on merit and available to all this comment is a sweeping generalisation and shameful'
'1','1151','Even on the occasions when  they do the job best?'
'1','1133','this room is a result of recruitment from 20 years ago not today&#039;s'
'1','1119','as a boss
'1','1145','Make sure that HQs are not staffed by people who have lost touch (or never had) any understanding of what occurs at the &quot;sharp end&quot;.  Policies and strategies must have genuine input from those people who live in the real world.'
'1','1161','I doubt there is anyone in this room who could not distinguish between bullying behaviour and management action.  Let&#039;s start by not announcing role changes in open meetings involving those affected.'
'1','1194','Ive seen that one work both ways it&#039;s not just the preserve of police officers'
'1','1120','I challenge the statement itself
'1','1136','whilst i have a plan to communicate this to my colleaguse but  i don&#039;t have the means to- simple things like the cash to hire a room big enough to get the whole boro in one place -this doesn&#039;t exist locally. some cash to implement locally pls'
'1','1153','I agree.'
'1','1171','As a senior woman officer now with the MPS for the fourth decade
'1','769','How do we take the optimism
'1','1117','can we continue with things and build on it
'1','1145','Make sure that all staff are given and understand personal development as opposed to promotion.'
'1','1118','Some stuck in the past and not positively embracing the community that you are now apparently serving'
'1','1128','stop knocking them as well - they are part of the community and a lot of them are working hard to engage and we need them as well - there are still a lot of cultural barriers within minority groups which stops them considering the police as a career. I am white female with a son and this attitude makes me sad because he has lot of diverse friends but this attitude will not help him his friends integrate.'
'1','1140','watch in this era of inclusiveness it happening to other areas'
'1','1133','as opposed to your view?'
'1','1194','We shouldn&#039;t need to state this
'1','1145','What are you going to do with those who don&#039;t live them?'
'1','1096','This is a real quick win.'
'1','1098','We still have an AC&#039;s  mess and a senior officer canteen at NSY. They are mainly used by MB
'1','1095','remember what the police demography was like 25 to 30 years ago - actually we have done rather well to allow a disproportionately large number of women and veisible minorityofficers to progress
'1','1171','Without whom we would achieve NOTHING'
'1','1126','stop dealing in sound bites - judge people on what they are not on what others say or on short exposure to them.'
'1','1145','This is huge cultural change management programme. We need skilled change managers to drive this through the organisation - do we have them?'
'1','1103','I am happy as a member of man board to do this. I have little doubt that my colleagues would also'
'1','1163','well done Bill on the &#039;troops&#039; point - about time I hate it.'
'1','1094','Under representation across the specialisms and in middle &amp; senior management must have special attention to bring a different perspective of policing. Our rituals prevent or disrupt the motivation of BME staff who wish to positvely contribute to the modernisation process'
'1','1145','That requires alot of trust and I&#039;m pleased your learnt from it but others will use it as a stick to beat people!'
'1','1117','Can we ensure a clearing house for all policy as each individual policy has impact on other policies so add them together and can&#039;t achieve them. prioritise policy and then we will deliver it some policies actually contradict others.'
'1','1108','Thanks Bill!!'
'1','1148','We are obsessed with this bit fill in some of the others'
'1','1104','i&#039;ll pass it on to the troops'
'1','1096','and &#039;cops&#039; while we&#039;re at it.'
'1','1140','was bill selected through formal process'
'1','1162','Reinforcing the need to get away from the military model - it is a block and quite frankly doesnt reflect today&#039;s military culture anyway - it is still based on the &#039;between the wars&#039; military culture when Commissioners were all ex miltary.'
'1','1123','understand what cultural changes take place in our constables after the first introduction to the public that leads them to want to get out of 247 policing within 6 months.'
'1','1133','Small thing but please can we just have one lanyard which says MPS and not which business group you belong to. Eg SO13&#039;s lanyards are bigger than anyone elses? Why - it&#039;s not for operational reasons
'1','1128','there is no normality in bullying this is a poor attitude and values nothing to do with rank band or grade they should not be in the organisation'
'1','1096','And sporting ones - on the right foot'
'1','1113','language in the met is changing
'1','1117','totally agree'
'1','1155','Lets not forget Ailsa when we talk about MB'
'1','1119','Bill-your great. That was inspirational'
'1','1093','If I can cal you Bill can we now accept that we should drop the title detective?!!!'
'1','1096','Sorry - on the front foot.'
'1','1148','He is still my hero
'1','1117','totally agree but more effective rewards for good staff'
'1','1140','call police a social service'
'1','1096','Another quick win.  We&#039;re all Team Met'
'1','1150','learn the lessons from &#039;Animal Farm&#039;'
'1','1118','I agree in promoting the right person for the job
'1','1166','the values must become the currency of the service ie the means by which our people inter react on a day by day basis.'
'1','1148','but he is still a sir'
'1','1131','MPA has been banging on about lexicon issues for years - and  IBs point about officers being civilians. I suppose the moral is that change in these practices has to come from within.'
'1','1116','Don&#039;t get hung up on language before addressing the very powerful message about values
'1','1096','No Bill - we police staff need you'
'1','1159','Perhaps the MB could push government to include Police within the protected employees who are catered for within the &quot;Whistleblowers Act&quot; . At present the MPS states that it will follow the spirit of the act and support all staff who blow the whistle. This is a miff
'1','1160','It is essential that we develop tools which enable us to evaluate how cultural changes are/are not taking place.'
'1','1145','Visibility
'1','1163','There is a real and significant amount of energy that needs to be put into this combined with commiting time to those you lead'
'1','1117','need to rotate people around organisation-more movement between centre and borough and specialisms. redistribute staff and skills'
'1','1119','Bring back John Grieve - a team with Bill
'1','1131','Yes!'
'1','1152','interesting irony......the response to july bombings was predicated uopn the humanist team without rank or grade etc yet still we remain this military based structure that responds to shoulder badges'
'1','1145','And a basic courtesy - how have we forgotten it?'
'1','1163','The culture around overtime needs to be dismantled'
'1','1169','we must not confuse holding to account with bullying we have a responsibility to deliver and to be held accountable'
'1','1146','Laanquage is everything! We must be hung up on it!!!'
'1','1191','An excellent presentation which was a sincere and persuasive argument for chnage driven by leadership and respevct at all levels.'
'1','1106','We are changing and the evolutionary process has started.  The trick is to speed it up rather than drive it. Otherwise it will be regarded as PC rather than ideological change'
'1','1126','be careful of changing some of the symbols thathave stood the test of time - they serve a purpose'
'1','1135','a corporate package for the delivery of the values message do not leave to individual senior management interpretation'
'1','1146','and spelling'
'1','1163','Top down please!'
'1','1133','Why can&#039;t we have joint promotion processes for police officers and police staff which test generic skills?'
'1','1173','not enough of this - inconsistency means that some will be recognised and many not - loss of morale and desire to change'
'1','1095','there are now hundreds of responses on here - from the top leaders in the organizationa - and a depressingly large number of them appear to be negative or narrow
'1','1157','i completely disagrre with you - as a much criticised memeber of acpo - i can only start to do my bit if people are honest enough to tell me what i need to do'
'1','1156','Need to rationalise the amount of information circulated to all for digestion we have to take risks to weed out what doesn&#039;t get read-acknowlede that more time in front of computers is less time leading our staff and challenging poor behaviour/changing the culture-we are slaves to te e-mail!'
'1','1117','stop running down what we have achieved so far! Last year the theme was &quot;building on success&quot;'
'1','1106','absolutely agree'
'1','1115','I think you should treat others as &quot;they&quot; would want to be treated
'1','1145','Without them there is no police service'

'1','769','Something for the troops to aspire to'
'1','1150','all managers should read &#039;Who moved my cheese&#039;'
'1','1093','bring back tenure - there was nothing wrong with it'
'1','1152','it is changing the stars are women officers and staff. anon male'
'1','1153','We promote and then decide what roles they peform (often ones thta could be carried out by police staff)'
'1','1096','Giving feedback isn&#039;t the same as 360 degree reporting'
'1','1117','Stop using theterm performance was a derogitory expression.! Once we develop the quality agenda we will need performance indicators.'
'1','1106','It is unhelpful to me that I presently can&#039;t get 360 feedback including partners&#039; perspective'
'1','1125','do unto others as you would have them do unto you'
'1','1153','Not just the public
'1','1106','change our performance measures to make values and public service more central'
'1','1171','Please don&#039;t forget how much good change we introduced post Lawrence.  We must not forget our &#039;corporate memory&#039; and learn some of the often difficult lessons we learnt in 1999.'

'1','1195','What gets measured get done seems to have been the anthem of the mps for the past 28 yrs of my service. Unfortunately they are all short term. If we are going to break the cycle
'1','1119','Bill your points are clear - change the internal culture and our externalculture will change'
'1','1127','Look at the rank structure (police and police staff) and consider how we hang notions of status
'1','1148','stop all this being self absorbed
'1','1148','embrace the problems and constructively support solutions. add some value to achieving the task. &#039;high level&#039; help should do just that -  help
'1','1151','My son is a PC and listening to him
'1','1106','our systems discourage challenge - they too easily turn the spotlight onto the manager trying to improve things'
'1','1151','did you challenge this behaviour?<br />We all have a responsibility to address poor performance'
'1','1106','the hard bit is distinguishing between bullying and the appropriate challenge of staff who then resent management action'
'1','1095','so what did? disrespect and discourtesy? i don&#039;t think so'
'1','1151','Look at the overtime at Air Port security and Manpad cover. Speak to the PC&#039;s doing this work and find out where money is being wasred.'

'1','1128','Experience suggests very important to have a clear framework where the roles of individuals in the change programme are clearly defined'
'1','1126','Why should the community engage with us?'
'1','1205','The focus is on deliverables and capitalising on the momentum'
'1','1116','The values are the messages that lead into conversation re corporate stratgy and service review (e.g by MB PERSONALLY)'
'1','1142','Back to point about Commissioner holding MB tgo account for quality of service provided'
'1','1151','Representative group from the OCU to see how this is to be implimented.'
'1','1094','cont from last comment.  Can look at Overtime and FR now.<br />A scenario - the Commissioner is keen to progress
'1','1116','Vlues are the glue that binds allof the pieces this morning'
'1','1152','although it&#039;s not captured in the strategy
'1','1191','A - name change
'1','1095','Can you deliver these clearly defined strands?<br />deliver a consistent message
'1','1126','The partnership approach on Borough has told us they want to'
'1','1205','We have learned as an organisation'
'1','1152','Post discussion'
'1','1193','How can you communicate with staff when you don&#039;t know exacly waht is happening?<br />Corporate Strat is start point as is most ready document.  Start with the high level objectives for the organisation.'
'1','1205','What will get the message across?'
'1','1151','What external links will there be'
'1','1128','Overoptimistic about what can be achieved in the first 10 days'
'1','1141','Innovation in communicating
'1','1147','Use internet
'1','1126','Where is the prioritisation coming from?'
'1','1126','It needs to come from the centre'
'1','1205','A clear
'1','1094','How will you ensure local level delivery for consistency of message.  The monitoring and evaluaiton of the message will be important.  E.g. getting the communicaiton package right and getting commitment from all here to ensure the message was received and well understood
'1','1205','What are the key messages we are going to deliver'
'1','1151','Not all of the strategy is of interest / use to all business groups.   It should all be focussed to the group'
'1','1126','We do need to do more on values and standards'
'1','1152','There is a real thirst for knowledge now as a result of the questionnaires that have been completed etc. so now people need to know what is the result if all this consultation.'
'1','1193','How can you communicate about the uncertainty of jobs etc in the future if you still do&#039;t know what the changes will be?<br />Cmsr said that there should be no reducndancies.  Staff are valued comodities in a growing organisation and there is scope for staff to be retrained and use their skills in other parts of the organisation.'
'1','1128','Will vary depending on the size of the unit - in some locations will be achieved - in others can only start the process'
'1','1205','There are going to be key changes'
'1','1205','We will be open and honest'
'1','1126','We are hoping to get more from the community'

'1','1151','Diversity
'1','1142','Need a national recognition that crime reduction targets are not the be all and end all'
'1','1128','Important to start the process in the first 10 days'
'1','1205','We need to make the uncertainty certain'
'1','1191','A - needs personal resp
'1','1094','What role will statutory bodies play?  They will demand progress reports etc.  The programme manager should have an MPA member on the programme board.  We have to get out of the silo working. The leadership academy will start the foundation for this new way of working.  It will also feature in the budget process in feeding back to the authority.'
'1','1116','what about other training?<br />Training is sporadic. We need it generic and centrally. QA process are needed locally. it related to how we value our staff. Centralised approacjh wold ensure same message. Transformational influences need to be brought together structurally. THey need to sing together'
'1','1141','Need to communicate on wider basis with other agencies'
'1','1205','Be clear about what we dont know
'1','1191','Q - HOW will you make people live the values?'
'1','1193','There will have to be reducndancies becuase of the specialist neature of some posts.  How do you deliver hte SR message and drip-feed it to give coleagues enough reassurance as we don&#039;t have all the answers?<br />Transparency.  People need to know where we are at the moment.  There are a lot of unanswered questions in SR.  We are failing to inspire staff to try something new in their lives.'
'1','1126','Need to look at the customer satisfaction: satisfaction with the police goes down after contact with them.<br />Need to think about who the customer is.<br />Who is going to mesure this satisfaction?'

'1','1205','What tangibles can we show to demonstrate change and progress'
'1','1141','Infrastructure changes will take longer than 10 months'
'1','1193','Need to think more laterally'
'1','1116','How are you going to get the balance between central message and local environment and the cultural differences'
'1','1144','How will you manage uncertainty? Everyone has their say - moving out of comfort zones - read opportunity not uncertainty - identify vulnerable staff/roles -ability for staff to raise issues without fear -bringing staff on board with changes -reaching the hard to reach staff - benefits/gains to staff - C3i model success/failures - lessons learned - threat is that some staff will vote with their feet - painful proces - reskilling staff opportunities for development - keen dialogue with line managers - best fitted staff will get the opportunities - danger is that good staff will explore opportunities outside MPS - effort in keeping best people - some will not want to be re-skilled - handling resistance to change'

'1','1142','There are broader roles
'1','1151','Corporate image.   Image given by first contact - words used
'1','1128','Recognised - importance of ensuring that fully understood within the organisation'
'1','1126','What about Staff associations
'1','1116','Thsi is why the idea of an academy is so goo. Passing thru an academy and giving that corporate message back into the work place is important  (How about a VALUES ACADEMY)'
'1','1193','We do have to be honest but avoid scaremongering.  From what you are sugeesting
'1','1151','Do you need warranted powers to do that / this role'
'1','1193','But when will we be in a position to know?<br />As it happens!  But we need to be able to dismantle it and communicate as we go'
'1','1191','A - ask the same question at the start and then again after set period
'1','1128','Focus on ensuring that changes will achieve the outcomes'
'1','1116','Where is performance measurement in this'
'1','1205','There is an enthusiasm for change'
'1','1116','maybe a customer survey / a citizen focussed based performance indicator'
'1','1205','There is going to be a change in focus and we will work in a different way'
'1','1095','examples of behaviour? how would it work - needs to be made explicit what cutlture change requires.<br />are behaviours up for negotiation? for managers to address if get resistance
'1','1142','staff are not interested in those roles which maximise the overtime
'1','1128','How to integrate this into the planning process for 06 - 07?'

'1','1148','Yes but in Bombay'
'1','1191','Comment - need to add the practical examples that you speak about to make this happen'
'1','1149','good point is to take time to understand the messages yourself  before communicating to others.  Strong centre will need to monitor performance against strategy.  Barriers identified but not enablers.  Main enabler is the communication itself.<br />How do you get the PCs and ground level staff to buy in?  Staff associations and unions
'1','1144','What would success look like or you and how would it look for you? Only once criteria had been established - constant evaluation of success - timescales for success - another set of measures around organisational change -  balanced scorecard - not too much impact on core business - identifying risks - ccontrol strategies'
'1','1191','A - need to look at who does what...'
'1','1147','How do we get to determine the quality of service?<br />Staff survey.  Important that we baseline current level of service quality and regularly measure the improving qulaity.<br />Should it be external as well as internal?<br />Should be external as well as internal and need to ensure consistent improvement on both sides.'
'1','1205','What are the quick wins'
'1','1128','Need to ensure that two activities are linked and integrated - clear accountability'
'1','1193','SR is about making sure we have the right team of players wiht the right attitude to deliver it.  The budget is about making sure we have the right tools to do the job.  But it is massively complicated.  Organisation of 40000  individuals with varying degrees of concern about whether at the end of the day they will have a job.

Are the values the easy bit?<br />A. NO. The workforce is diverse and individuals need to have the concepts / aims explained.<br />&quot;Leaders make cultures&quot; hence everyone needs to see the boss.

'1','1128','who are you? give me your contact details'
'1','1092','Enthusiasm'
'1','1191','We need to apply the same standard of excellence to daily interactions with our customers as we achieve in critical incidents'
'1','1197','People will need to have be flexible - that way there will be room for everyone in the organisation'
'1','1136','Translating the strategy into what it means for people&#039;s role'
'1','1147','You don&#039;t get a second chance to make a first impression (PLUS programme circa 1988)'

'1','1108','The Met needs to reform
'1','1173','We will keep everyone up to date on progress'

'1','1160','The world is watching us'
'1','1190','and can police staff have free travel?'
'1','1142','we really need to be clear about the re-focussing and cuts issue.  A lot of comments are not seeing the bigger picture.  This is about changing the way we work.'
'1','1133','The SMT - we need them to mean it if we are o deliver'
'1','1118','The change process will be difficult.  Not all staff will embrace it and we need to ensure as many staff as possible are ready for change
'1','1197','Protect and serve there can be no greater priority'

'1','1204','The background - changing face of London and society; Olympics etc'
'1','1136','We consider our staff to be our greatest asset - the changes that take place will not happen without negotiation. Service Review will open up opportunities'

'1','1131','show some maturity. Please?'
'1','1106','The first port of call will be cultural change.  Well meaning individuals could do a lot of harm to the corporate message.

'1','1240','there is a need to develop a DVD that explains both the Hydra concept and the course'
'1','1264','students often have unrealistic expectations of when to get results of actions eg forensics just because they percieve they are in training environment need to balance giving info to move scenario on with accurate expectations when return to operations'
'1','1280','As the course is not assessed there is no recognition of skill level
'1','1277','Yes but we cannot get long term commitments'
'1','1240','did you know that the whole Hydra concept was designed around a zero cost community of ideas'
'1','1267','This could also be opened to a wider audience to attend to assist in CPD'
'1','1223','No
'1','1254','The 2nd pilot of the SIO exercise at Wyboston introduced a review on the final day by selecting  different areas of the investigation and moving the syndicates into their neighbours room and tasking them to prepare a critique of the syndicates action/decisions in one of these areas. This was followed by a lively debate in the plenary room. Worked very well'

'1','1262','Are you referring to the speed at which the scenaro moves and keeping on track?'
'1','1265','the days on the MSC exercise are long enough - students are immersed in their case study and may not want to switch off from that'

'1','1267','Similar issues when attendees are from different forces and have different policies over certain issues or the set up of departments is different'

'1','1265','new scenario needed even though the existing one hits all the right spots'
'1','1246','who asesses the assessors ???'
'1','1251','At one time there were regular meetings managed by NCF and ideas and material exchanged. Mismanagement by NCF!!!'
'1','1258','This could be the start'
'1','1280','By what criteria are SIOs selected?'
'1','1240','what about the confict of a safe learning environment and an assessment centre'
'1','1265','research required into performance of individuals within syndicates'
'1','1252','Shouldn&#039;t this learning take place during the 3 week SIO course - a good idea to open evening lectures to previous students'
'1','1256','A concern is how to monitor and address the student who hides behind the experience of others in the syndicate.'
'1','1262','Do the trainers and consultant sio need to be trained assessors'
'1','1277','In the very dynamic arena that Hydra generates how do 2 facilitators fairly assess 12 students'
'1','1253','allowing for local variations and procedures is just about okay but if we accredite all SIO&#039;s nationally then they need the same input eg if a force does not use the IAG system then they have to have it in their training'
'1','1268','what would they be assessing'
'1','1246','For credability the answer must be yes.'
'1','1223','But they will have to evidence the NOS&#039;s for their role so why not start  now! It is not as if they&#039;ll be sacked because of it.'
'1','1251','This element of training shouldn&#039;t be assessed - they get assessed in the workplace and this should take place before they come on the course (MSC) - otherwise they shouldn&#039;t be there.'
'1','1254','Not quite true
'1','1258','I wouldthink they need to be A1'
'1','1277','Hydra is a developmental tool - assessment should take place in the workplace. Discuss?'
'1','1260','&#039;safe learning environment&#039; ethos?'
'1','1256','A problem across all areas of police training. Very little in way of incentive / reward for trainers'
'1','1264','there is no getting away from assessment at some later stage of the program but the key is who does the assessing and what is their credible right to assess and against what criteria also what do you do with those who arn&#039;t yet competent must have processes to identfy and be strong enough to action plan'
'1','1254','Hence we are here today to get back on track'
'1','1267','The assessment should be for development needs and not a pass/fail scenario - after all
'1','1258','There is nowa National criteria for entry to the programme'
'1','1223','Due to the introduction of PIP it would be useful and credible if they were
'1','1256','Local drama groups or colleges'
'1','1258','Need more of this type of user group to share information'
'1','1265','assessment is part of all of our working lives. The way in which this can be achieved in syndicate based activities needs research. The credibility of the assessors is crucial.'
'1','1251','In fairness to the candidates and facilitators this cannot be objectively achieved.'
'1','1268','absolutely where would creativity and flair be if the assessment criteria were known by the students
'1','1267','They may not be sacked but they could be extremely vulnerable next time they are in the box'
'1','1260','absolutely right - people should enjoy/look forward to this fantastic training tool - not fear it for fear of being &#039;scored&#039;'
'1','1280','What process should be in place to monitor the success ir otherwise of the SIO DP.? Will reviewers be asked to comment on the performance of the SIO as part of terms of reference.  Will Head of CID do this as part of CPD'
'1','1262','Does the current/new scenario need to have specific assessment areas written in to support continued development under the pip process.'
'1','1256','shouldn&#039;t be a problem if PIP L3 selection criteria is rigoursly applied'
'1','1268','Are you aware of the self assessment model that has been developed supported by evidence from the field'
'1','1264','you have to show competency under pressure sooner or later if british airways have a pilot who could not land a jumbo jet in a simulator would they still let them have a go for real?'
'1','1280','If so how will that be fed back to centre'
'1','1253','Occasionally we get a student who &#039;performs&#039; throughout the week as if it was an assessment centre. This is detrimental to the group and the course and convinces me it should be avoided'
'1','1258','What about the problem when someone is assessed in the workplace already as competent then they fail the hydra where does that leave us'
'1','1256','A very valid point'
'1','1223','Assessment focusses the mind. All learning is an opportunity and failing now and again happens.'
'1','1254','I can try it out and if it works talk about why it did
'1','1277','Completely agree despite the fact that they are investigating a horrific scenario the process must be an enjoyable one or credibility is destroyed.'
'1','1265','what&#039;s the purpose of the exercise if not to allow the students to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding?'
'1','1280','How reliable is self assessment?'
'1','1260','self assessment is another issue altogether. Professionals must learn from their own Hydra experiences'
'1','1222','You can&#039;t simulate everything'
'1','1251','A necessity for the overall programme
'1','1268','it would cause massive problems if disclosed in a court case and the officer then suggested that the assessment was not fair or realistic in an environment where he or she was beholdent to the performance of other members of their team'
'1','1223','You can try!'
'1','1256','I am confused. I thought that the 1 week exercise was only a self assessment by the students themselves.'
'1','1254','Assessment can get the student to regurgitate the words from the book
'1','1260','exactly why assessment is a negative word in Hydra world!'
'1','1253','Same as &#039;education education education&#039; = lots of hot air very little tangible progress from the norm'
'1','1268','hugely if it is the basis for discussions with the course director and the joint completion of a development programme that would be evidenced in the workplace'
'1','1265','It&#039;s a great environment to demonstrate to individuals the areas they need to improve upon. Is their any research on methods of &#039;self-assessment&#039;?'
'1','1268','yes yes'
'1','1258','Sometimes the MET  influence in the exercise turns some delegates off'
'1','1223','Not that I am aware. Surely trainers need to know the context in which their students will be working and the pressures they will be facing.'
'1','1252','The skills learned are generic and equaly applicable to any specialism'
'1','1254','The development program if not defective should highlight deficencies before they attend the final practice on hydra.'
'1','1277','What is so wrong with student created action plans
'1','1256','Can you fail HYDRA? what is the assessment criteria. I have asked before and told that there isn&#039;t one.'
'1','1265','And Hydra is the ideal environment to demonstrate competency and good judgement - but how do we recognise it?'
'1','1254','The way forward surely
'1','1260','Trainers &amp; SIO consultants could commit to spending once a year to visiting and running other Hydra MSC sites
'2','0','How could we work together more effectively'
'1','1260','a monthly MSC forum on 10Kv on the web?'
'1','1254','By consultation'
'1','1246','Regular contact / working group.'
'1','1267','a chatroom - not dissimilar to this system but accessible through the web'
'1','1240','what would that look like'
'1','1223','I understood there was a Hydra Managers forum. Do they not share products
'1','1262','web site forum?'
'1','1277','Excellent idea - why not?'
'1','1277','Trainer exchange programme supported by user Forces'
'1','1260','see above!'
'1','1267','I think that tends to be more from the tecchy angle rather than the products'
'1','1256','saves having to travel 3 1/2 hours each way to take part'
'1','1254','As I commented in the earlier question
'1','1222','Swop Shop?'
'1','1264','trainers could cross over to other facilities and train at other centres to spread varyation and other angles to approach same objectives'
'1','1267','patients is a virtue - some are not as quick on the keyboard'
'1','1260','perhaps less often - three monthly?'
'1','1222','On a bridge...foggy morning...Berlin?'
'1','1246','excellent idea good opportunity for cross pollination'
'1','1268','what about an alumni conference where graduates could meet and talk about the developments in the sio world
'1','1267','spelling is also an issue!'
'1','1223','Within the NCPE &#039;communications strategy&#039; a protocol could be developed.'
'1','1277','Completely agree - specific achievable agenda items For example community impact assessment'
'1','1262','I will work on any abroad!'
'1','1251','6 monthly meeting and exchange of material.'
'1','1265','a national product with national learning outcomes'
'1','1260','if curse it si'
'1','1254','How many of the sites have run an MSC without asking for the attendance of an SIO or facilitator who has experience in running the program?'
'1','1265','6 monthly meetings by exercise leaders and staff would be advantageous'
'1','1268','10kv did operate on the web for the borough commanders for the london bombings
'1','1260','like it'
'1','1256','Who going to foot the bill for travel
'1','1251','Do we need to have a review of exercise and supporting material with all centres contributing?'
'1','1258','do the debrief points and the aims and objective be thesame as the 3 week course'
'1','1268','there needs to be a specific professional group around the sio programme with invitees from the DI programme so that they can be developed in parallel'
'1','1223','This would meet collaboration agendas but perhaps unrealisitic.'
'1','1253','A 10000 volt type system where each centre can answer a set of criteria to be entered at the end of each MSC along the lines of
'1','1260','lets do it'
'1','1254','There are sites around the country such as our colleagues from Avon and somerset who run the MSC but not on hydra. They have valuable ideas so to restrict it to Hydra user groups would exclude them'
'1','1277','Think outside the box - why be negative - sponsors'
'1','1265','a meeting would enable  critical evaluation of new media (audio/video) which could then be shared'
'1','1268','this is such a major weakness as the whole event is reliant on the skills of the facilitator'
'1','1222','Who?'
'1','1268','another strategy heh?'
'1','1260','Still necessary for regular face to face forums
'1','1280','Regular conferences arranged by NCPE
'1','1256','Good point'
'1','1251','I thought this was more to do with addressing technical and IT issues?'
'1','1265','if a new exercise is imminent
'1','1268','surely this is a cost for NCPE to bear
'1','1254','This has been done
'1','1223','I cannot believe anyone would run such a course without an experienced SIO involved! Where&#039;s the credibility?'
'1','1267','One could influence the other without too much cross over'
'1','1256','Not negative -realistic and practical'

'1','1268','exactly but now they seem to be in silos'

'1','1657','the families appeared to be aware of many unfolding issues in Egypt before the flo were informed and it became difficult to pass this information to the families as they already knew more than we did.'
'1','1620','Perhaps send was not the right word to use
'1','1685','Red Cross were present in Sharm and were the first to suggest activities to bond the team who had been working flat out for several days.  This needs to be monitored for the NEXT time. I was great at water polo.'
'1','1686','We were available but did not get deployed straight away
'1','1671','Not politics

'1','1663','what criteria was used to make visial initial assessment that a body was a british national? which would then allow UK team access to same for DNA etc... was this done purely on skin tone?'
'1','1636','I agree - there was a degree of confusion as to who was performing what role. WMP are very short of SIM trained staff and as a result struggled to understand the issues and concepts of this area of work'
'1','1678','The media cover was helpful initially as information was quite slow coming through'
'1','1667','some of the fco&#039;s have no idea about evidential trails and continuity
'1','1669','The SIO worked extremely hard
'1','1671','We did well to get it down to only 2 lists. On Bracknell there were at least 5!  Nonetheless the FCO learned and for Op Dimension USA hurricanes) there is only one list
'1','1653','Making use of BCU media officers assisted with the liaison between the families and the FCO if they wanted to engage with the media.'
'1','1666','Very grateful for Graham LAWRENCE to be deployed to the incident room and provide us with expert knowledge re family liaison and assist us with the writing of the FLO strategy.'
'1','1667','and he cant hold his liquor'
'1','1661','some flo&#039;s were not aware that there is a national dental records office in eastbourne which has a data base of nhs patients
'1','1655','Yes he was supplied with tea and biscuits on an hourly basis'
'1','1678','the IT issues caused problems with the individual forces'
'1','1660','There was difficulty in keeping my family updated with critcal as information being sent by E mail was not being received by me for up to two days.'
'1','1636','Rock suffered as a result of Bracknell - there was a reluctance to deploy staff overseas when the RDT role was supposed to cover many of the functions that the police FLOs could provide. The FLO strateg was focused on avoiding multiple deployments to the same family hence a reluctance to send staff overseas as FLOs'
'1','1638','Could some thought be given to helping third world countries that are in the terrorist spotlight  and where Uk nationals flock in large numbers  making them likely targets
'1','1650','Coroners society have been aware of this issue for several years.  There is the expertise within the society to formulate their own emergency plans but it would appear no-one wishes to get going and make it happen'
'1','1652','shame he can&#039;t book a hotel'
'1','1675','All Police press need to be aware of what they release regarding families and should at least run it past their FLOs'
'1','1666','I think a Deputy should have been introduced earlier to ease the pressures the SIO was under'
'1','1657','it was difficult to inform the families what had actually happened in Egypt as flo was unaware and families were being told by all sorts of means. throughout this incident there has been an undercurrent of information passed to the families by media and other victims families'
'1','1685','The interps were very good out there
'1','1655','To be fair some police officers struggle with this!!!!!'
'1','1661','the rdt were great at sorting out the admin picking upcollecting from the airport
'1','1667','most of the body parts were too badly decomposed to be able to make any vu=isual assessment at all
'1','1636','The decision not to deploy more FLOs was made by the Police Gold commander and the FCO Gold owing to the functions of the RDT team in respect of the provision of short term FLO care'
'1','1638','This could not be done on skin tone as in the case of Chas jayawardena for instance  it was done on a combination of factors including hearsay evidence of where the person was mode of dress tattoes marks scars etc'
'1','1670','Very confused about need for FLOs in Egypt<br />- had to train 2  DVI staff in SeS to take DVI from family???<br />- surely there was only a need to complete DVI forms and familial swab?<br />- there were DVI staff there to take DVI from family and RDT staff to deal with pastoral family matters<br />- the decision not to send FLOs was a joint FCO and WMP Gold decision.'
'1','1679','not really
'1','1636','I agree - the team acomplished a tremendous amount in a very short time. The Operation was a real sucess and a credit to all those involved.'
'1','1674','Property from victims rooms
'1','1686','Samples were taken from every possible body part
'1','1636','Agree - there is a lot of misunderstanding in relation to DVI and the different functions within it. A national DVI cadre should be established that ensures suitably trained staff are deployed in sufficient numbers as quickly as possible.'
'1','1679','how big do you think our team was
'1','1620','I understand that under certain circumstances direct contact with the FLO will be quicker if coming from those in Egypt
'1','1685','Stop I&#039;m feeling sick now.  T'
'1','1679','Unfortunately some of the families kept in contact with each other and it was difficult to manage the information flow.  Where we were aware of the potential for information to be passed inter family we tried to manage this by arranging simultaenous meetings'
'1','1686','Andy and Don need some sort of award for their efforts.'
'1','1620','The FLC&#039;s who manage the FLO&#039;s need to appreciate that in these incidents the FLO have to gain all the Ante-Mortem data as soon as
'1','1653','I appreciate the &#039;care&#039; of the families is one issue
'1','1675','The FCO teams need an imput regarding exhibits to assist the RDT/DVI teams when next deployed'
'1','1679','We put ourselves under a lot of pressure as we were working long hours everything seemed to take a long time to achieve.  The reality is we arrived on the Monday tea time
'1','1678','My family were full of praise for the team out in Egypt.'
'1','1685','Chas was thought by the locals to be a local at first.  His tattoos were the best initial ID factor.  His final skin colour was bright red.'
'1','1655','I managed to get a parking space in Lloyd House Car park!!!'
'1','1679','Fantastic support from FSS DNA results were delivered on time enabling the ethical confirmation of all the identifications and the identification of 93 out of 96 body parts'
'1','1648','Perhaps we should all have a &#039;team hug&#039; in the car park.'
'1','1666','Hopefully West Mids e-mail system will improve when we transfer to Outlook in the near future.  We did have problems with Force &#039;Firewalls&#039;.  E-mail was good as it was auditable
'1','1678','We didn&#039;t!!!'
'1','1679','The initial response was excellent.Casualty bureau was established and A DVI team was ready to deploy within 12 hours however they were stood down and their deployment was delayed by two days
'1','1686','Dvi equipment needs to be flown over rather than a 4 man team humping 180 kilos of excess baggage during a 24hr journey.'
'1','1675','what is going to happen with the remaining unidentified body parts'
'1','1665','whats an exhibit label'
'1','1638','On arrival at shaarm we had to beg borrow steal equipment but when contacting west midlands for re-supply this was done quickly and efficiently thanks'
'1','1655','Don managed a full complete sentence without swearing. An achievement in itself!'
'1','1620','All flo&#039;s deployed in these types of critical incidents need to be protected if thats the right word to use. The flos&#039;s had to get the Ante-Mortem data asap
'1','1672','This Operation was a success even with the limited staff.  This was down to old fashioned policing and hard work.'
'1','1620','Did the flo&#039;s feel they were given enough info from the flc&#039;s to brief their families?'
'1','1653','I am conscious of the fact that this was not a UK investigation
'1','1685','FLO&#039;s in Egypt?  Of course they were needed.  There will always be families who will fly out to search for themselves

'1','1685','Anything from the Icecream box anyone???'
'1','1650','You have to be out of bed early to beat casualty bureau operators to car parking spaces...'

'1','1669','WMP need to keep a store of supplies ready for any future deployment.'
'1','1686','Getting info from egyptian authorities was like platting fog.'
'1','1638','agreed however the SIM was the person on the ground who should have been listened to'
'1','1675','continuity is vital as had this incident been on UK soil there would have been massive continuity and therefore disclosure issues had offenders been arrested.Some Police officers had not timed or dated seizure or movement of exhibits in UK/Egypt which then cannot be updated via Holmes 2 system'
'1','1652','It was an issue when delivering or collecting property.<br />Could it be possible for a space to be reserved in future when an FLO has given a<br />approximate arrival time'
'1','1660','Yes but I was still informed of the remains being identified by my family
'2','0','Exhibits'
'1','1667','Don was tremendous when it came down to knowledge of expenses...we renamed him &quot;arthur&quot; (skargill)'
'1','1669','Staff need to be deployed to UK airports that have flights to the effected area asap to capture DNA of any families going to find relatives
'1','1666','This was not an investigation in the Police sense we all know.  Our role was to identify and repatriate bodies.  I totally agree that FLO&#039;s need to be updated with correct information and as soon as possible.  A lot of what you are being told today is as a result of all statements being read (there were well over 100 witnesses to this incident) this takes time.'
'1','1663','deputy was very sucessful addittion who undertook the logistical &amp; personnel issues most diligently'
'1','1661','ask the familys in sharm if they  found the flo useful!<br />the rdt team are not cops- and were gratefulfor the info from the flo about body repat
'1','1648','I cant listen
'1','1666','This highlights the need to strictly adhere to the flow of information from Egypt to the Incident Room in order for the MIR to be the central hub which contains all information to be disseminated.'
'2','0','Welfare'
'1','1685','BA allowed that 180kg&#039;s to &quot;slip&quot; into the hold at no charge.  That didn&#039;t happen on the Sharm side.  We got charged for the extra weight.  It&#039;s a good job that a credit card was on hand.  GO bags are an absolute must for the next time.  Store them at airports (or better still each consulate) and regular checks on the use by dates.'
'1','1655','All survivors were given a pre-typed form to complete upon returning to the UK
'1','1663','selection of SIM would be worthy of more appropriate selection criteria
'1','1667','the snorkelling was fantastic'
'1','1663','regardless of inexperience in this field of work
'1','1671','Continuing complaints from families that they know nothing about the &quot;assistance package&quot;.<br />Is this because UK FLOs were not informed or didn&#039;t get the message?<br />Or was it because the families were either given too many different items of  information or because the information was not repeated often enough?<br />And was the information passed only orally
'2','0','Family expectations during and now'
'1','1620','I think this is a valid point
'1','1650','Despite the fact that the Casualty Bureau trained 25 MIU receivers to work in the Casualty bureau we were allocated an untrained
'1','1659','What assistance package.'
'1','1638','The cultural issues between the Chief prosecutor and the team was something that needed very careful handling this did result in tension at times however the skillful handling of this by Mr  Yousef FAOUD
'1','1650','Which IT issues are those?  How can we overcome them?'
'1','1666','All FLO&#039;s and Force FLC&#039;s were made aware of the after care package at the beginning of the enquiry.'
'1','1661','the flo in eygpt sholud have had a daily briefing with the flo coordinator back in the uk.<br />what about faxing the flo logs too back to the uk- if poss this would be a good idea - if the flo had written them up!'
'1','1685','The Scuba diving was.  Remember how the Red Cross lady was the only/first person who was concerned about the long hours and lack of &#039;play time&#039; we had.  She sorted a water polo session that really smashed the ice.  Warning for the next time that stress breaks must be added.'
'1','1663','attention to detail
'1','1641','Our family were aware that their plane home from Egypt carried bodies
'1','1667','and i was good at that water polo....'

'1','1661','these officers
'1','1663','incidents arouse whereby when callers were re contacted by NIR it was established that groups of families were outstanding
'1','1648','If I hear the word &#039;pudding&#039; again

'2','0','Briefing'
'1','1688','In the final analysis of the operation
'1','1653','Some of the expectations of families could not be met.  For example giving the family an information pack on their return to UK - this turned out to be the Homicide Pack and is not really suitable for incidents abroad.  May be we need to have such a &#039;pack&#039; which is generic enough to fit a multitude of incidents?  Bit difficult I know!'
'1','1648','Have any official &#039;thankyou&#039; letters been sent to people like airline staff
'1','1675','some of the body parts of family members were so small that they were placed in the same coffin.The thinking was that the families would have even more distressed if they saw one coffin containing2/3 persons being unloaded'
'1','1666','This briefing tool is an excellent idea
'1','1663','poor distrubution of workload &amp; deployment of staff in egypt caused unnecessary frustrations'
'1','1675','The FLOs when deployed to an operation should be seconded until completion not doing nightshift other duties as it is a hard enough job as it is.If home forces cannot agree this dont deploy'
'1','1651','ACPO Manual Of Guidance demands FLO&#039;s for all Fatacs. Investigating officers are kept separate. Not relevant but point needed to be made in light of comment.'
'1','1663','why does SIM believe DC&#039;s were required in preference to PC traffic officer
'1','1675','You have all done very well'
'1','1655','Fax not able to send international faxes. No TV in CB to monitor news. E mail problems. Not enough computer terminals for non CB staff to have access to.'
'1','1641','Seconded!!!! I was called by my Sgt to tell me they had a prisoner waiting in custody for me.... I was somewhat busy completing DVI forms/lifestyle statements/trying to collect DNA. Etc.'
'1','1655','Good point..its the same course
'1','1667','pudding....'
'1','1675','This is exactly what i am talking about'
'1','1663','He dealt with frustrations very diplomatically...he could have been better supported rather than dictated too'
'1','1650','A copy of this debrief would be welcome
'2','0','What specially trained specialists do we
'1','1652','I was accused by my division for taking the p--s because I worked rest days and hired a car and only calmed down when they were given a code to claim it back'
'1','1675','Shouldnt the FLCs manage this'
'1','1655','A number of survivors statements were required from people living within the Met. The requests were made from the West Mids and despite the fact they were stretched after the bombings all Stmts were obtained swiftly. Great team work and dedication'
'1','1659','Most Flos are experienced investigators
'1','1663','as per the DNA samples may be it would have been more appropriate to escort the property back when egypt deployed staff were returing ...putting them on the same flight would have been a suitable solution'
'1','1667','i havent heard anything from it....i keep calling but it never replies...'
'1','1655','A policy decision should be made regarding FLO officers to visit survivors who may not have lost family members but have lost close friends and have witnessed the incident'
'1','1685','I&#039;d like copy of please too.'
'1','1650','&#039;UK policing&#039; needs a national DVI team.  However
'1','1675','We as a Police Service need to have trained teams ready for rapid deployment now in each Force
'1','1653','Consideration of role of FLO and DVI.  Should this be a seperate function?  With the advent of strategic forces we have an opportunity to work out how we can best respond in the future to these disasters.'
'1','1659','Traffic Officers who deal with Fatacs  are usually supported by Family Contact Officers as it was recognised nationally that from a stress and wefare side the officer dealing should not be in contact with the victims family. This is not a new concept'
'1','1641','I&#039;m a shift PC and a FLO. The two can be mutually compatable
'1','1671','Exhibits officer (UK) needs locked store and a fridge.'
'1','1666','Does a strategy need to be in place as on several occasions the FLO&#039;s in the UK were tasked via actions from the team in Egypt regarding matters that the NIR had no knowledge of.'
'1','1650','All fax lines and lines into the casualty bureau are now international lines.  Despite repeated requests from CB it required an international incident before it was enabled!  It is established policy not to have live TV in the CB.  Callers to CB can hear it and it may appear unprofessional.  Also CB operators prefer not to be confronted with graphic images of what is happening at the scene whilst they are dealing with distressed callers.  Access to email can be facilitiated on request at any time.'
'1','1653','Future training - FLO logs should be in an electronic format (similar principle to HOLMES SIO log).  It would mean that there isn&#039;t the security issues of faxing these documents as they can be e-mailed within police secure network.  It would assist me as an FLC to have access to logs for monitoring/supervision purposes and early ID of issues within the family which are documented can be viewed by FCO etc.  It could be searchable as a document and could be sent anywhere in the world quite easily!!'
'1','1654','my family are wanting an update regarding the memorial service - since they were initially asked if they were interested and their reply was yes - they have not heard anything else from anyone - do we have any further information on this subject?'
'1','1666','Our understanding was that the families would not be given &#039;airside&#039; access so would not have seen anything.  The bodies were obviously taken straight to the mortuary and as a vast majority of you are aware they were not suitable for viewing.'
'1','1686','There should be no misunderstanding re the above comments.  Officers worked long hours in extreme heat and unpleasant conditions.  All of us were ill at some stage
'1','1650','The role of FLO in disaster victim identification is just one aspect of the process as are other aspects ie victim recovery
'1','1661','when/ where is this memorial service?? can anyone attend??'
'1','1655','Gold control was issued with 4 spaces....however this was a closely guarded secret and wasn&#039;t used therefore the spaces were taken away'
'1','1691','Session 2'
'1','1685','I think it important that the SIM is better supported when dealing there at the scene.  If the SIM asks they should get.  They don&#039;t ask for additional resources just for the hell of it.  By not allowing the extra FLO&#039;s the Egypt team were put under more stress.  Do we not trust the SIM out there?'
'1','1649','The FCO help with the passport checks re mispers was invaluable.  All the staff provided were friendly and helpful. An asset to the Cas Bureau.'
'1','1620','This lead by the FCO
'1','1679','all staff in Egypt were working long hours
'1','1675','I helped him?'
'1','1691','Not at all this is a significant reality of the tensions and the need to support officers who are delivering within a high stress environment'
'1','1650','Fab...that will help CB enormously
'1','1661','Great idea as long as you have access to the net! It was only because one cop took his own lap top with him we had contact with the MIR.'
'1','1655','I am a DC with many years experience investigating etc.....I know for a fact that I would not make a good FLO and I know that many of my collegues who are not from a CID background are great in this role. SIO&#039;s and SIM&#039;s need to be educated that being a DC is not the be all and end all in an investigation'
'1','1686','The SIM should make the decision regarding what staff are required.  The SIM should not be contradicted by people in the UK
'1','1661','Not enough briefings held in eygpt.'
'1','1646','basic exhibit handling is incorporated in the RDT training-along with continuity and integrity around exhibits.'
'1','1673','We do not think that we are experts in all areas but if you want us to do a job allow us to get on with it
'1','1679','The SIM doesnt believe this at all
'1','1655','One of the major problems in the incident room was the lack of info re the scenes. Some people believedthat ther was only 1 explosion....it was only after speaking to survivors that the scequence of events materialised'
'1','1649','Casualty Bureau needs to have hooked onto the IT a way of displaying level one mispers with ease of use to the FLC.   With a scrathboard so that messages can be attached re body repatriation times religious issues press interest.  Post Mortem date time. etc'
'1','1661','what assistance package are you talking about?? i am a flo and am only aware of the homicide package.'
'1','1636','The FCO assistance package has &quot;not for public distribution&quot; written at the top of it. This caused considerable confusion for the FLOs that impacted on the document&#039;s distribution.'
'1','1679','The criteria was a comparison of the Ante mortem forms against the post mortem forms
'1','1661','the admin support in sharm was great- but we should have had a briefing from them to tell us what they can help us with on day 1'
'1','1674','why a briefing - what did you need to know? Crack on.'
'1','1670','The terrorist support package<br />- funded flights to scene<br />-funded hotel accommodation
'1','1666','The After Care package was sent out via e-mail in the early stages of the enquiry to all the FLC&#039;s.'
'1','1679','The welfare of the families was left to the FCO and a strategy was written around that.   The ante-mortem data has to be gathered quickly as detailed descriptions were required to find the bodies amongst the total dead'
'1','1636','This was done. Survivors were met and identified as significant witnesses. A policy decision was made that they would be visited by an FLO trained officer to obtain the statement. The FLO was not a &quot;deployment&quot; but an opportunity to offer support in a sensitive manner and advise re support from other agencies.'
'1','1663','The understanding is that the SIM was to form part of the &#039;team&#039;
'1','1685','In the Tsunami callout I am aware that Occy Health were present and there role was just to monitor and look after the staff.  None went to Sharm.  Is this

'1','1620','V v v true'
'1','1661','Noone from the RDT came to the mortuary with any of the families. - in my opinion it should be the flo who does this anyway'
'1','1678','The FCO in general were very informative but were not very helpful initially when the families were asking for financial help'
'1','1663','valuable part of the daily briefings'
'1','1679','Unfortunately we had little choice of aircraft to get the bodies back home.  We were concious of the possibility of this and tried tom avoid loading taking place in public view.'
'1','1649','Briefings on a daily basis are inportant so that FLOs can update families otherwise you just look at each other!<br />You have got to be able to tell them something about what is going on in the disaster area.'

'1','1678','FLO briefing sheets were circulated on a daily basis during the early period of the operation. They represented the information that was comming from Sharm and the NIR. The documents were a summary of the daily briefings given to the NIR. There were a number of days when the information from Egypt was very confused and contradictory owing to the state of play on the ground.'

'1','1644','The Board should select me as I have showed again that I can work with families from different social and cultural backgrounds.<br />I  maintain a professional honest and open approach which  families appreciate.'
'1','1645','Being able to be honest and giving the family information even if it was not what they wanted to hear'
'1','1671','Contributed to breaking down barriers and thus to the success of a multi-party team effort
'1','1655','Prior to OP ROCK
'1','1678','I successfully acheived respect and formed a strong relationship with the family I was depolyed with as an FLO. I am now also competent with the completion of the DVI forms and the collection of Anti Mortem  Data. I have gained a great deal of experience from working on this deployment
'1','1674','This was the first time I have worked in a family liaison role. Much of this ime was spent with the Annelie Vickers mum and step dad
'1','1667','This was the first time I have had any experience as an flo<br />it was the first time i have completed dvi forms<br />it was the first time i have been deployed abroad<br />it was the first time i have done any mortuary work<br />it was the first time i have had experience of body parts<br />i showed great deal of versatility and flexibilty during my deployment<br />as i acted as a<br />flo<br />mortuary assistant<br />outside enquiry team officer<br />exhibits officer'
'1','1649','Op Rock developed me because I was able to adapt to various diferent roles within the Casualty Bureau basically being able to cover other peoples roles when required.  Utilising existing communication skills I was able to secure necessary essential equipment for other areas of the operation.  Having done the work as an FLO on Bracknell I was able to observe some of the difficulties from the Casualty Bureau side of things hopefully making me a more understanding FLO.'
'1','1663','The fact that I was a member of the west midlands police team
'1','1638','I was fortunate enough to have gained experience in the role I performed in Op Rock during a previous deployment
'1','1662','from evidence and intelligence coming into the casualty bureau
'1','1679','Flexibility<br />Upon deployment to Egypt I was uncertain as to what to expect and was nervous about the responsibility.  The team was selected through PNICC and I was working with total strangers who&#039;s skills and knowledge were unknown to me.<br />Its fair to say that whilst the skills and knowledge of the team did not cover the broader skills required by the DVI process they rose to the occaision carried out whatever role they were asked.<br />The training given is based on early adoption of systems of body recovery
'1','1653','Serious consideration has to be given to what the role of an FLO should be.  The basis for this is the fact that information coming from the Theseus and Bracknell feedback is the &#039;Gold&#039; standard is being set by the Met.  However
'1','1636','Who viewed the deployment as a jolly? The conditions in Egypt were appalling and the team overthere worked tremendously hard. I am staggered that anyone could describe the deployment in such terms and it sounds like someone is terribly missinformed.'
'1','1675','I have gained a vast amount of experience in dealing with an incident of International importence.Liasion with outside agencies such as FCO
'1','1665','you get the job'
'1','1636','What happened to the risk assessments that were prepared by the incident room for the Egypt team?'
'1','1685','With dignity and repect I processed the bodies and parts of the victims from Sharm.  The working conditioins were very poor.  I worked long hours in 45degrees heat to get the correct bodies and parts back to the families in the UK.  I requested to be on this team and am proud that everyone came home - it was all worth it. All 10 bodies home - top job  - can I go now?'
'1','1641','ta!!'
'1','1636','Please establish a common understanding regarding DVI work. There is a lot of confusion regarding this at all levels.'
'1','1678','Please give us more support next time.'
'1','1673','More support shown to SIM and their abilities to make decisions regarding what deployment is required'
'1','1665','lets get some uniformity between all the forces - its not bad but could be better'
'1','1657','A decision needs to be made quickly about DVI form procedure before we are confronted by another incident in the UK or abroad.'
'1','1636','A MOU should be established that recognises the demands placed on officers deployed as FLOs following mass fatality incidents. To have an FLO perform a role such as this on top of the day job is unfair.'
'1','1669','Each major force
'1','1661','what a shame the acpo officer couldn&#039;t be here at the start of the day. It would have been nice if he had also introduced himself to all those present in the room.'
'1','1686','Officers deployed overseas in these type of incidents are under extreme stress.  not only from the task in front of them but from being away from family.  everythin possible needs to be done to ensure that all reasonable requests from scene are granted
'1','1644','I respectfully request that ACPO learn very quickly to value their FLO&#039;s as most still see it as giving Tea and Sympathy when in fact the reality is that FLO&#039;s are dedicated to giving the best possible support in extreme/difficult and emotional situations which enables the main investigation to run smoothly and reach an early conclusion.'
'1','1672','A dedicated disaster team with all the training requirements available will have to be seriously considered now.  These types of incidents will become normal in the months/years to come both abroad and in the UK.'
'1','1659','It was not airside access that was required but to be there to grieve. as per Op Bracknell. a private area to view the landing not the unloading.'
'1','1685','Listen to those on the ground.  Listen to those at the scene.  These calls will only become common place.  LISTEN'
'1','1646','Having worked on op-Bracknell/Theseus/Rock.It has been a pleasure to witness mutual aid working succcessfully.(a credit to ACPO around the country)'
'1','1679','What is a DVI team?  Whilst DVI at home can be rolls royce
'1','1655','ACPO......You need an insight into the individual roles played by all staff involved in a mass disaster. You need to make yourself aware of how long it takes to fill in a &#039;simple&#039; DVI form when the family member is traumatised by the loss of a love one...and to be aware of the stresses it causes the officers on the ground who have to make life changing decisions whilst not in the comfortable surroundings of an air conditioned office!'
'1','1641','we are underpaid and overworked. it takes a special kind of person to agree to work with families who have been through this kind of trauma.Most people you ask say they couldn&#039;t do it. Please make sure command teams are aware this kind of deployment is difficult and stressful
'1','1652','Please pass on to divisions the role played by FLO&#039;s so that we do not get beaten up whist trying to do the job because they perceive we are not carrying out normal duties not knowing or caring about the additional pressures we are under'
'1','1668','Please give more credit to the Family Liaison system and to the officers who deliver such a great service to the people of this and other countries'
'1','1650','I would like to thank ACPO for the support they gave during the course of Operation Rock.  They asked questions
'1','1670','There seems to be an understanding that DVI - swabs
'1','1653','The role of the FLO needs to be re evauated in the light of these incidents.  It is imperative that the role of investigator is not underminded by the increasing expectations of families
'1','1638','There were a lot of negative aspects to Op Rock such as the working conditions hours lack of kit understanding of roles cultural differences etc etc however that the operation was a success bears testimony to the value of those involved in it.<br />YOU now have the opportunity to build on working practices and experiences learnt .<br />That we are here today is I hope an indicator that we will not squander this opportunity however<br />The proof of the pudding as they say'
'1','1675','Please treat these incidents with the seriousness that they deserve and provide your staff with the resources they need to acheive best results.An agreement must be reached regarding deployment of all staff via respective forces to enable them to do the job at hand not what is waiting on OCU'
'1','1674','definitely be led by the sio at the incident - if more flos are asked for
'1','1663','credit the difficult roles junior ranking officers perform in the heat of battle
'1','1685','I agree!'
'1','1671','Form a dedicated national DVI team.  Keep the team together for a minimum of 1 year as a team (not just a clutch of officers on call from their forces) to work through a strategy to cover incidents ocurring anywhere (UK or overseas).<br />Put even more effort into strengthening Interpol so that countries around the world will automatically call upon Interpol in the event of mass casulaty incidents (or certainly those involving foreigners).<br />Make sure CCS and DCMS push ahead with establishing a joint mechanism for dealing with those bereaved by (and with survivors of) mass casualty incidents.'
'1','1649','It is inportant that the IT (Hardware and Software)side of these operations are properly address.<br />Failure to do so will result in distress on the part of the bereaved/misper families and Police Staff.<br />Very often communications with a foriegn area in this day and age should be a little better than a mobile phone or an email with no &#039;confirmation&#039; of delivery system.<br />Families crave information and all the officers at the scene of the incident are engadged with the identifiaction/repatriation process.<br />There does need to be a factual source of information employed by the Police/FCO so that families can be kept up to date daily. Indeed so that FLO can be kept up to date as well'

'1','1717','This is a real problem
'1','1708','the fact that nationally it is recognised that we are doing a good job... is this message getting across?'
'1','1702','Their is a real need to close that gap between &quot;volume&quot; crime and the requirements of high level crime.  Not only does it require new traininf it also requires a change of mind-set'
'1','1707','I agree with all of the above. Not having clearly defined positions
'1','1705','sweeping statement - what is ridiculous please? Are you saying that anyone can be &#039;managed&#039; into passing an exam?'
'1','1711','big steps have been made by the Forensic Faculty with the changes in attitude and appoach'
'1','1703','all need a good level of arson training
'1','1697','the training is not as thorough as it used to be
'1','1698','But this is not available to all. The basic awareness course is just that
'1','1721','There seems to be a reluctance on the part of some people to relinquish or share their knowledge
'1','1709','WE HAVE GOT TO SWEEP AWAY THIS APPARENT DIVIDE BETWEEN SCD4 AND SCD20. We are ALL trying to deliver top quality training'
'1','1718','Yes'
'1','1703','yes but it is a big step from the basic theory only 2 day course
'1','1704','There is a negative view of crime scene training at the forensic faculty coming back from TP - it is worse now tp staff instruct - there is a lack of understanding of the roles CA staff carry out'
'1','1707','The courses that have been developed.'
'1','1713','This may need current up to date knowledge and wide experience which may not be available at the FF'
'1','1708','how about a lift at Rowan House?'
'1','1696','Many AFPs are waiting over a year to get onto a Photography course which means they are passed over to assist at more elaborate scenes due to lack of this skill'
'1','1712','this is interesting - what place does blame have in training'
'1','1718','Expand tyhe recruitment process. I know they doa practical now (which is a vast improvement on previos selection provcesses) but could we not do more to weed out those that will never make the grade- extended assessment centre?'
'1','1707','Our courses are recognised as good by other foces but not always our own.'
'1','1705','Explain how that works then'
'1','1708','we concentrate on what doesn&#039;t work well but fail to celebrate our successes'
'1','1713','That things are starting to change and that the future might be brighter (but not orange)'
'1','1709','We need an additional facility on the south. There is a belief tha getting to hendon is difficult due to the Northern Line. This last week has demonstrated this.'
'1','1704','why arent staff who are Centrex trained made to train to ease the burden on the present volunteers - TP managers should not protect them'
'1','1695','We should be proud of our people and not forget that they have to be onboard for any change to work - their ideas and concerns are frequently marginalised and they feel excluded.'
'1','1698','Good question
'1','1697','the training is too affected by who is the trainer
'1','1708','I was proud of the way we all pulled together for operation Theseus'
'1','1701','we all have an ieal for training but it has to balanced with the business need and operational commitments'
'1','1724','working towards corporacy so everyone is treated fairly'
'1','1710','The exam should be viewed as an initial assessment which gives a good indication of whether you are suited to this type of work.  If you can&#039;t even pass this
'1','1706','the  trainers need to be valued and treated as adults and professional when they come to Hendon.  Some good people will not work at Hendon as they don&#039;t want to be treated like children'
'1','1702','So why does it seem that the police officer training ie the Advanced Exhibit Officer course is so intensive on the forensic side when there are already hundreds of professionally trained forensic staff in existence already?'
'1','1716','that will be evident at next weeks 70th anniversary'
'1','1705','Still waiting'
'1','1704','It is basic only in that there is more to fit in and less time to do it!'
'1','1715','very unfair comment
'1','1714','Why not measures of performance for managers and Pdm&#039;s as they take over the continuation training after leaving the academy'
'1','1721','Some of the SCD4 SMT need to be dragged into the 21st century
'1','1711','we need to ensure that training standards are set to ensure that the spec of what is delivered is consistent to all.'
'1','1712','Is there a review group looking a forenic results and feeding back to managers/trainers ?'
'1','1696','Most AFPs learn more once out at Borough than at training'
'1','1703','should there be a selection process or protocol instead of just anyone who volunteers as we are desperate!! People do not like the travel or the way they are treated at hendon'
'1','1718','The fact that we have shown that we are willing and have been able to change to meet the needs of the MPS and London.'
'1','1697','people who mentoe on borough should be assessed for their ability
'1','1716','desire amongst staff to improve'
'1','1698','This alos makes the new team members feel devalued and also hinders there career progression.'
'1','1721','Then do we need to extend the training?'
'1','1709','Some trainers at Rowan House believe that we are the poor relative of the family and that the main building receives better funding and a more sympathetic response to requests for facilities'
'1','1701','sometimes the academy is just ssen as a booking service for the classroom facilities'
'1','1724','we should expect a high level of service and committment from new trainees but equally our experienced officers should be leading by example'
'1','1711','Are all SCD4 procedures documented? Do our staff mentor the AFPs to undertake their work following these set procedures. This doesn&#039;t appear to be the case.'
'1','1698','No
'1','1704','it is unfair to fail students because they cannot write up an answer in a specific way which has been arbitrarily chosen and doesn&#039;t have any relevance to their job'
'1','1707','Listening to people and making realistic changes and improvements and letting the interetsed groups know why some things are not feasible.'
'1','1696','Training which took place at Lewisham was very well received by those working in the South'
'1','1702','We should be removing the clips from peoples wings to see if they can fly not just stopping them. We should also be there to catch them if they don&#039;t!'
'1','1712','Has any one from the business group asked the Criem Academy to develope this'
'1','1697','the training needs to be the same for all boroughs after people leave hendon
'1','1701','smt fragmenting staff has caused some of these training issues'
'1','1717','could we possibly look at a training facility like a house? we could run real time scenarios and record the exersise
'1','1708','This was changed at the request of TP to make way for other modules within the same timeline'
'1','1705','Perhaps the interviewing stage is at fault - perhaps the MPS isn&#039;t targetting the right people'
'1','1698','Shouldn&#039;t someone have thought of this?!'
'1','1718','Poor Senior Management Team that does not corporately show good leadership. The culture is very much do as we say not do as we do. How often have any of the SMT walked the floor and met  /talked to staff?'
'1','1706','suggest madatory mentoring courses for all fp&#039;s and sfp&#039;s - i know its not the answer to everthing but its a start.  afps should make it known to their bfm&#039;s if they are not being supported by their Borough colleagues'
'1','1695','There is far too much learning &quot;parot fashion&quot;
'1','1703','there is an SOP on intranet'
'1','1712','Interesting Has SCD4 personnel considered rotation into training as  development tool'
'1','1722','yes please do'
'1','1707','Good communiction so that resentment doesn&#039;t build on both sides.'
'1','1714','Why do main responsabilities for projects etc always get taken from the Police staff and given to Police officers?'
'1','1704','There has to be a cost-benefit consideration here
'1','1720','design of a course to undertake obtaining finger/palm prints at mortuaries'
'1','1701','our experienced officers are being asked to support so much without any support themselves'
'1','1719','Why don&#039;t the FF have up to date knowledge and experience?'
'1','1694','This is essential to ensure the smooth transition from the Rowan House to the placement on Borough. Are the Mentors given enough guidance in the development of the AFP&#039;s to ensure that they are adequate support - it isn&#039;t all about the mentor&#039;s being good at their job
'1','1703','who QA these..........'
'1','1708','It is simply different levels of knowledge. The AEO course is very specific to very experienced officers. The AFP initial course is much more generic'
'1','1699','This is option that is worth considering'
'1','1718','I&#039;d agree.'
'1','1701','we should do more than just an application form and an interview perhaps an aptitude test should be re-introduced'
'1','1696','Yes
'1','1695','It is vital that trainees should have a deeper understanding of the subject.'
'1','1709','Consideration should be given to assess students who fail written examinations by means of a Viva. This could be a more suitable assessment than a 2 1/2 hour written examination'
'1','1708','this was much easier when we were all SO3.'
'1','1705','This may be because staff are being recruited in such numbers it is reduced to a &#039;factory&#039; process which can lead to lowering of quality'
'1','1703','Students are finding out from previous students'
'1','1704','why do senior staff seem to task police staff and then retask again to police officers when they havent given the staff the time to deliver - this is very demoralising and devaluing'
'1','1702','A lack of contingiency planning for when a large number of vstly experienced staff start retiring over the next 2 to 5 years'
'1','1701','we have to work together to overcome these people who have a blinkered view of development'
'1','1706','then document this so we are all aware of the CA&#039;s staff roles
'1','1724','I agree - we should keep the standard. But our teaching methods must reflect individual learning styles to be fair to everyone'
'1','1720','ditto fisc senior management'
'1','1697','the intergration may help the forensic training improve as the detective side seems so much better even though they should surely be behind the forensic side'
'1','1709','Every knowledge an reasoning examination I have ever sat was 3 hours long. The K R exams should be 3 hours long. It is better that students have too  uch time than not enough.'
'1','1721','Better planning with regard to numbers of students to be trained so that we do not find ourselves in the situation of suddenly having 60 new AFPs to train and having to shecdule in additional courses'
'1','1713','Core function is fine as long as it retains value and relivance - What if the core function dies.'
'1','1712','then they do not deserve to be a manager in the MPS'
'1','1705','Trainers should be based at the FF and not &#039;parachuted&#039; in to deliver a course!!'
'1','1697','trainers need to be assessed as well'
'1','1703','not from the students
'1','1695','Trainers should not be permament college staff'
'1','1715','i agree
'1','1713','Needs to lay out clear roles
'1','1695','The college should concentrate more on organising courses and not actually teaching.  That should be left to trainers seconded form their day jobs.'
'1','1695','This is in essance what they should be.  The training should be mainly carried out by staff form Tp
'1','1709','Encouraging staff to research training that is available to improve themselves. Getting them to realise that training is not GIVEN as a right but for staff who will benefit from it'
'1','1722','OK so now we have opened the box what would the SLA look like'
'1','1701','clearly defined responsibilities for maintenance of material'
'1','1702','Structured mandatory continual professional training at regular intervals that is adhered to'
'1','1704','timescales
'1','1714','A big piece of paper with writing on
'1','1703','agreed times for resits'
'1','1717','unified aproach to supply of trainers'
'1','1698','Deployment of trainers. Either TP or Faculty based
'1','1715','so cynical'
'1','1707','clear outline of roles and responsibilities for  SCD4 and SCD20 staff who are involved in training'
'1','1701','who manages the students while they are at the academy - is it the trainer or the academy training managers'
'1','1709','Accrediation for trainers which would have meaning for promotion criteria. This would recognise the very positive benefit that an individual has made to development within SCD4'
'1','1703','can be useful if agreed by both sides and meets the business need'
'1','1718','Establish a co-ordinating role for training taking an overview of who has done what
'1','1704','tp staff to commit to supplying trainers without development managers having to beat them up'
'1','1714','An agreement of commitment that MUST be adhered too.'
'1','1695','The college should concentrate on organisation of courses.  Delivery should be by people who come in from the different parts of the Directorate especially to teach specific things.'
'1','1712','Needs to cover the provision of experienced personnel posted or seconded to the crime academy for a fixed period say 12 months minimum. This would ensure that each course is delivered to the same standard and prevent the trainers becoming stale'
'1','1701','operational trainers have an important role to play in keeping the training &#039;real&#039;'
'1','1697','everyone to know what they are talking about. To give out the correct up to date information. For all included to realise they should be working together.'
'1','1717','who is responsible
'1','1702','The facility to refer under-performing staff back to the Academy for more training in he areas that thy&#039;re deficient in'
'1','1724','written feedback to be supplied via tdp&#039;s within a set time scale'
'1','1696','Agreed
'1','1706','suggest the academy'
'1','1701','i disagree you should have criteria that are manageable not infexible'
'2','0','Log'
'1','1716','need to agree criteria  for identification and appointment of pratitioner trainers e.g duration of secondment
'1','1711','SCD 4 define the current processes/procedures. CA design the training to deliver the learning. SCD4 responsible for informing CA of changes to processes.'
'1','1712','I like this'
'1','1715','very true - need an agreed amount on each of the 4 clusters or ratio based'
'1','1707','FF staff included in discusions on career pathways for TP and bureau staff.'
'1','1721','It needs to contain agreement about the number of courses that will be delivered
'1','1713','Perhaps individuals also need a &#039;statement of expectation&#039; which could out line their individual responsabilities. For example an associate trainer will...... or FF trainers will...'
'1','1710','I completely agree with this'
'1','1705','The current system with trainers coming from the workplace produces extremely variable quality of training from excellent to mediocre'
'1','1703','the trainers have responsibility in the classroom'
'1','1704','There needs to be an understanding on TP that there has not been any allowance made for CA trainers to teach - the people could not be attracted. This will prevent the griping that CA managers do nothing'
'1','1720','have you not heard
'1','1708','We should work in partnership for the mutual benefit of our staff. Clearly defined roles
'1','1706','operational trainers keep the training relevant and have recent expereince of the real world'
'1','1710','Why do staff from Fulham specifically need to get involved?'
'1','1714','TP fingerprint branch to commit staff and make sure they keep to thet commitment'
'1','1709','Shared training for both groups of trainers where there are common issues'
'1','1716','must be binding on both parties'
'1','1708','excellent idea'
'1','1698','Have them on a longer rotation. They are no use to either area under the current program.'
'1','1717','why is it that  staff are not attracted to training'
'1','1704','this needs clarification this should be CA managers to teach'
'1','1706','then honest feedback is needed to the managers - how can this be adressed if no one is aware'
'1','1702','The Academy to facilitate higher learning rather that outside agencies'
'1','1712','how you manage the situation when the person coming in was working the day before and picks up a comple job.'
'1','1718','Do you have any witnesses?'
'1','1701','no such thing as an associate trainer either a trained trainer or not!'
'1','1713','Perhaps FF staff could provide training and development to others'
'1','1700','This needs to be addressed. The current system of an e-mail to the borough based trainers results in the same old faces turning up. Some trainers put themselves forward for the CENTREX training but then never come up to the academy to teach. There needs to be a specific rota put out by the Developement Manager so that all do their share'
'2','0','10 days'
'1','1694','The appropriate support structure from a Borough level also needs to go with this
'1','1698','Shoudn&#039;t be passed out in the first place if they are not upto it in the college.'
'1','1716','trainers ought to consider themselves as part of the academy'
'1','1712','so do I 
'2','0','10 weeks'
'1','1695','Generic topics can be delivered by SCD20
'1','1715','allowing individuals to train should be seen as a reeward not a chore
'1','1704','This is okay if tp dont keep moving the goalposts'
'1','1705','This is the only benefit - otherwise training is a &#039;secondary&#039; role which leaves room for substandard training by a few'
'1','1713','You can&#039;t fill out the application unless you can evidence the experience and achievement.'
'2','0','10 months'
'1','1697','The recuritment process should be longer to weed out those who will not pass without too much help
'1','1712','can we have regular dialogue to ensure this happens - quarterly meeting maybe'
'1','1703','Why do the college input on TDPs when they have no dealing with the students
'1','1721','This is probably a verry silly question but why is SCD4 not part of the Crime Academy?'
'1','1709','Both visiting trainers and academy staff should be working as a team. Sadly sometimes this issue is seen as a power issue.'
'1','1715','line managers should assess the suitability'
'1','1724','the Academy can only teach the theory behind the skill. All practical learning can only be done on Borough and management must take responsibility for  on the job training'
'1','1725','What are we doing well?  Where do we need to improve?  This analasys will provide a reference for all.<br />One document to say what we work too for all to see.<br />What are the frustrations with this?  Senior management not buying in - wil senior management do what suits them.<br />There are evidently 2 cqmps that are not listening.<br />2 xcamps want to work as one however the communication is not getting through.  Having one doc as referral means that all will work as one.<br />Needs are different for each unit - need to ensure that what is being delivered is up to date
'1','1725','How do you build lost trust with SLA?  How would you regain the trust?<br />Lay out expectations - define what you are willing to imput into the relationship.<br />What mechanism is there out of the SLA to produce?<br />Support from above is key to moving forward.<br />Does your directorate understand what each unit is doing??  How do u get the shared mental model?  By working and negotiating with who will be responsible for certain elements of the training.<br />Do the courses link up - overview of other depts in directorate?  No<br />Review system needs to be built in with SLA.'

'1','1759','Agree
'1','1765','The supposed training we had undetaken was pretty worthless'

'1','1761','Proud to be associated with the good work achieved by the CoLP'
'1','1762','Working like crazy around the clock so that some of the Metropolitan Police photographers could leave and attend other scenes as a lot of things were going on whilst Theseus happened'
'1','1765','what like the birds nest and umbrella?'
'1','1769','Good humour was maintained'
'1','1772','The City of London Police team contributed out of all proportion
'1','1765','ditto'
'1','1756','Very proud of my family
'1','1768','city police did themselves proud during theseus as did officers from other forces. The integration of officers was essential as it prevented tribalism. My team became very effective and close knit'
'1','1758','worked because experienced detectives did a lot of it. theyre used to getting dirty and getting on with it'

'1','1766','Abstraction from normal family life for a long period
'1','1771','Yes
'1','1765','Confusion caused by crime scene managers who all had a different idea of what we were meant to do'
'1','1772','Insufficient clothes
'1','1764','It transpired that the SO13 badge was elite
'1','1759','bar prices at the hotel'
'1','1762','Carrying on working when we heard (initially) that another 4 bombs had gone off'
'1','1765','Apart from when it was baking hot'
'1','1768','absence from family<br />lack of clothing<br />too many briefings from city management some of which contradicted previous directions eg corporate card useage.<br />coping with smells during mortuary duties.'
'1','1762','Poor mortuary managers who did nothing'
'1','1756','Not sure what there role was
'1','1762','No accomodation provided'
'1','1770','It was the satellite SO13 personnel who seemed to become Pathologists and bomb making experts overnight. A guy from Nottingham springs to mind.TO/55/ER'
'1','1766','SO13 were quite obviously under staffed. Whilst there were a higher proportionate of &#039;i know what I&#039;m doing
'1','1763','Disappointment that a senior officer stated at a Team Leaders meeting that those who were dealing with the body parts were only doing so well due to being motivated by the team leaders. This was B***ll****s as everyone that was doing the work was self motivated. It worked really well without a rank structure'
'1','1764','sorry about the smell'
'1','1762','Being told pay would be different for some of us within the same Force'
'1','1772','Working practices at first reinforced the adage that &#039;repetition is the bedrock of the police force&#039;.'
'1','1769','Lack of preparation for such an incident in regards to kit
'1','1765','oh lardy da'
'1','1761','lack of resources utilised that were available in-house rather than reliant upon MET'
'1','1766','It&#039;s better than having trench foot!'
'1','1768','crime scene managers were inconsistent one inparticular gave no direction while others were superb'
'1','1771','Are we any further forward then now???'
'1','1765','lack of training and forethought by management as to how we would really cope'
'1','1772','An idiotic &#039;naughty boy&#039; briefing from a Met Inspector on day two or three
'1','1756','City management poor in the intial handing out of kit
'1','1765','to much waiting around'
'1','1766','Some of these were a bigger pain than the SO13 people'
'1','1726','do you want to expand on this?'
'1','1769','Lack of consistency in direction from COLP supervisory at time when moral was at its height and the main task was about to begin.'
'1','1761','lack of information in order to feed back to my Team as to how they could actively assist'
'1','1726','what should they have been doing'
'1','1768','complete pillock who should take a long hard look at himself'
'1','1763','good idea to have a god ideas book or books. Bad idea not to provide said books'
'1','1765','I had a nice room actually'
'1','1756','I know that the team leaders were seperately praised for there work
'1','1769','Learning curve was provided
'1','1764','i&#039;ve never known it to be different'
'1','1759','What are you on about? I don&#039;t remeber this'
'1','1766','neither do I
'1','1765','Nice one Colin'
'1','1762','Only ECD were looked after'
'1','1766','I&#039;d rather be cool/cold than roasting whilst doing this job'
'1','1768','he discussed things such as the press and your behaviour around the site and not taking phones into the mortuary amongst other points'
'1','1772','We were told not to read the Sport in public etc
'1','1765','Being made to feel that we were doing some really awful job when really it wasn&#039;t that bad'
'1','1771','Reporting for Mortuary duties in a suit!!'
'1','1759','that wasn&#039;t me...'
'1','1770','Er what did you expect'
'1','1762','Making it work - letting people know when the work would be starting and where and who was needed - this links in with &quot;too much waiting around&quot;'
'1','1756','Very angry at this idea that the Met were going to show us how to do it
'1','1770','Didn;t see you buying a round'
'1','1766','Kit is being sorted out
'1','1768','personal perspective differs for everyone'
'1','1772','Agreed but we&#039;re not twelve year olds.'
'1','1764','A &#039;good ideas&#039; book is not what i want. Too many de-briefs already.<br />Then will anyone brief us on what has been learnt after all this.'
'1','1762','What a hard life...some of us didn&#039;t get offered a hotel!'
'1','1758','poor food at hac. met girls did their best but officers deserved something a little more upmarket'
'1','1768','cant think of any training that would suffice'
'1','1756','It was clear that not one bit of thought had gone into how were to be initially deployed.'
'1','1769','Had typical COLP comment from supervisory officer that we would just be dealing with the &#039;City&#039; bodies. Heaven help us if we have a war  and City are assisiting.'
'1','1770','Sorry could you repeat that'
'1','1764','separation of building staff (scaffolders)from mortuary teams'
'1','1766','Too many times I was asked if I was Okay'
'1','1768','agree from the city viewpoint got the impression that the Mets knew what to expect which was a relief'
'1','1770','You could have gone home!!!'
'1','1756','He was very poor and may want to work on his future method of delivery.'
'1','1765','if they&#039;d done full PM&#039;s you might have a point but I didn&#039;t see the mortuary staff making a song and dance about the task in hand'
'1','1769','COLP Supervisory comment that we would just deal with &#039;City&#039; bodies. Heaven help us if there is a war'
'1','1759','you alright dick?'
'1','1766','don&#039;t start!'
'1','1765','it was only a little cut'
'1','1756','Arrogant  MET DI in the mortuary
'1','1772','Agreed my grandad was on the Somme before he was twenty
'1','1758','is it okay now?'
'1','1762','Surely not!'
'1','1770','you are fraud squad yu cook the books'
'1','1758','bad spelling'
'1','1756','so what'
'1','1768','dont try counselling'
'1','1772','Hate to say it but at first there was half an idea that there would be 4 separate mortuaries
'1','1762','No specific role for COLP Scenes of Crime Department throughout'
'1','1769','Was DVI TEAM not Team MET as stated on numerous occassions 
'1','1757','but they were meeting themselves coming on duty - too little and this made some jaded others were A ok.'
'1','1756','Like your old force would be better
'1','1758','inconsistence'
'1','1759','They did turn up and get the beers in'
'1','1765','how about as an observer at a real incident like Thailand'
'1','1766','Whilst staying away from home is the best way to get the job done
'1','1761','please clarify'
'1','1771','If there had been more bombs on the 22nd July would we have had to keep going.... Or would reliefs be drafted in. There was no exit plan.'
'1','1766','I&#039;m alright'
'1','1759','The massage went down well'
'1','1772','There was an assumption that none us would want to go home
'1','1763','just needed to put the money behind the bar for critical debrief.'
'1','1765','Can&#039;t fault the City but I don&#039;t think the Met got much assistance'
'1','1761','good point'
'1','1770','Did not need it They get in the way'
'1','1758','city have done well overall'
'1','1762','A day off during the work was most welcome and the 5 days after even more so'
'1','1772','Should I feel guilty about not being in the least broken up by what I saw?'
'1','1756','Welfare very good better
'1','1766','the teams worked well together and it would have been hard for a newcomer to get into the dynamics of an existing team.'
'1','1761','No'
'1','1771','With the tube messed up I found it hard to get home!!'
'1','1770','Sorry who are they???'
'1','1757','Once the team had entered the mortuary - some of those trained but left behind felt locked out and uninformed'
'1','1765','I think by staying away from home it made us more institutionalised'
'1','1772','We were and have been very well looked after.'
'1','1769','City were good on welfare. Helped with a domestic issue and couldnt fault them. Actually believed they wanted to listen and help rather than just saying they did. City supervisors take note!!'
'1','1768','welfare got their gradually. After a very poor start by City management it improved thanks to DCI Williams.<br />Hotel - absolutely necessary although rumours of using section house did not help<br />Food - good in the end<br />Time off - managed well within the dvi teams when required.<br />Overtime - managed well<br />HAC - Ideal location'
'1','1761','Further resources needed to support this vital role'
'1','1756','Very true
'1','1765','Surely we should have all had a compulsory one on one session with a counsellor'
'1','1766','A bit harsh. I think we probably need the Dept. to be available when we ned them
'1','1764','Not sure that the personal de-brief was effective'
'1','1769','No'
'1','1762','I have got to say again
'1','1768','tried to engineer reliefs via DCI Moore but was stonewalled on the basis that it would be too much of a shock for newcomers!'
'1','1770','My door is always open'
'1','1765','I can&#039;t fault the desire to allow us to earn as much overtime as possible but the reality is we should have had frequent rest days'
'1','1762','What personal debrief?'
'1','1763','At least they threw their voice behind not wanting us back at Bernard Morgan House to save money.!!'
'1','1766','On our course we discussed this and decided that we didn&#039;t want to have to download on the family every day. I still think this was the right decision.'
'1','1765','Thats not compulsory'
'1','1769','They sat in the bar and brought drink
'1','1761','Welfare unfortunately were not included from the off hence delay in response'
'1','1771','Why are we still having de-briefs three months after the event? We have to close the door on it I feel...'
'1','1756','was your grandad in the somme?'
'1','1757','its nice to know in advance who is visiting the site as I failed the Cardinal test on the stairwell to HAC rest room by calling him father.'
'1','1772','I think it all depends on what your family is like
'1','1768','worse for families in some respects as they can only imagine the worst.'
'1','1765','As long asyou are sure that sometime
'1','1758','we should not have been filling out welfare debrief questionnaires with your mate looking over your shoulder'
'1','1756','City response back in Force was excellent.'
'1','1769','And they knew what they were capable of.'
'1','1768','humbug'
'1','1761','Post incident support programme within the Force has been offered and is continuing to be offered
'1','1759','They did that letter sending thing though didn&#039;t they'
'1','1772','Compulsory
'1','1763','If you wanted days off you could have taken them'
'1','1766','No
'1','1771','Nice to know Welfare Dept is there if you need them.'
'1','1761','should be provided by trained debriefers'
'1','1758','no gladiator is a great movie'
'1','1762','I hope there was a lot of support for the body recovery teams at the scenes
'1','1756','Very dissapointed that the Occ health debrief onl happened two weeks ago and the operational bebrief is only happening now.  Should have been closer to the event.'
'1','1759','No I&#039;m not!!'
'1','1771','Are you still okay Dick?'
'1','1761','Each individual is different it becomes problematic if timescales are set in stone'
'1','1772','I&#039;m not sure if this the right section but from a stress relief point of view I was highly amused when were told to move from our seats as the Countess of Wessex was coming into the room.'
'1','1765','Don&#039;t you think your family have got a right to know what you are doing and how you feel'
'1','1768','i agree this should be the final say'
'1','1762','I was working a night shift..I think another date should have been made available'
'1','1757','There were some rumours that we were costing the job(?) too much being located in a swank hotel - is this so?  - are there plans to use these type of facilities in future<br />to hear rubbish like this 6 or 7 days in to the task
'1','1761','Useful comment noted!!!'
'1','1766','I&#039;m alright
'1','1758','some great things and then other little things that take the shine off. eg debate over accommodation'
'1','1768','I too met him and didnt know who he was luckily 6th sense kicked in'
'1','1762','Because we may well have another such incident and we need to learn what to get right next time'
'1','1756','I miss it'
'1','1768','if the job doesnt look after you it doesnt deserve loyalty'
'1','1766','DCI Williams was good
'1','1761','please expand'
'1','1764','DCI Williams was very good
'1','1756','Our leadership at HAC was ok'
'1','1762','It was such a rush to get the work done..there didn&#039;t seem much time for management in the photog dept'
'1','1765','Although his jokes wore a bit thin'
'1','1771','None of the COLP Management knew what to expect so it was good DCI  Williams got a grip!'
'1','1763','It was DCI Williams who stated that the troops are only motivated due to work of team leaders which was not true.'
'1','1759','Indeed
'1','1766','City supervisors
'1','1771','And you did not know whether he was looking at you or not!!'
'1','1770','Senior City Officers could learn alot from Graham Williams....suggest they contact him for a course in man management'
'1','1759','team leaders - not really needed'
'1','1766','What did Colin Cowan do at the mortuary
'1','1756','Met DI in Mortuary was arrogant and did not listen
'1','1763','DI Andy Manning was fantastic stating exactly what the hours claimed would be and that this was not going to be a penny pinching excercise'
'1','1765','DI downwards you mean
'1','1762','Perhaps the City needs to be swallowed up by the Met then!'
'1','1757','the pathologists nice bunch that they generally were did not appear to have had any consolidated briefing whether by meeting or written instruction and the first few days it was chaotic due to their bidding to re arrange the environment to what they each felt it should be - meanwhile the floor walker DI didn&#039;t appear to be gripping them.'
'1','1764','Who will be the one with experience when he has retired. No-one in the CoLP comes to mind.'
'1','1768','DCI Williams did a sterling job.<br />City management fledgling by comparison.'
'1','1759','Andy Manning kept nicking my smokes'
'1','1756','Could not say the same about the other two very unsure of themselves.'
'1','1772','DI Manley came through extremely well and should take charge of the whole mortuary response for the CLP. He is not a paragrph builder and should be with us a long time. Best man for the job
'1','1763','Many Team Leaders had no more experience than us mere mortals and yet were portrayed as being a wealth of knowledge. If they were so knowledgable why did we sort out our own system'
'1','1762','There was some variation on what was done with parts smaller than 5x5x5.  Each pathologist dealt with them differently - some didn&#039;t open the bag
'1','1758','who were they?'
'1','1756','Not sure many DCI&#039;s anywhere could match him.'
'1','1764','He could get an OBE hopefully'
'1','1768','Di upwards didnt struggleto get a coherent line they never got that far. Substitutes bench was their role.'
'1','1765','The problems with SO13/Crime Scene Managers stemmed from lack of management from above'
'1','1771','Tim Harvey never botherd to visit us.'
'1','1766','In addition
'1','1772','It wasn&#039;t a City led situation
'1','1768','he got some tickets for Queen'
'1','1762','DI Manning spoke up for us SOCOs and helped us a lot to get a fair deal in terms of pay and accomodation'
'1','1772','Didn&#039;t seem that way to me.'
'1','1756','DI Manley and DCI Moore'
'1','1759','he bought dinner once....no wait
'1','1756','Which was a positive really- well done him.'
'1','1770','Now we know what&#039;s to be done. No senior officers on site get the job done and go home.'
'1','1765','To be fair we had so many people visiting I got bored answering their questions'
'1','1762','What did the Crime Scene Managers do?  Any ideas?'
'1','1769','Top man DCI Williams
'1','1768','agreed DI Manley - genuine and an asset'
'1','1771','That we were volunteers'
'1','1768','everyone was equal
'1','1765','well i think we were actually press ganged'
'1','1761','Be cognisant of the legal implications and the impact on the Force following 7/7 and to refer to specialists in-house'
'1','1772','There is no need for the vast majority of mortuary staff to be called in for at least 36 hours-this has been said repeatedly but nobody listens.'
'1','1757','three months on and the seniors of the department we come from and the ACPO of CoLP have not revisited the teams on this incident and given out any guidance on how future incidents will be staffed
'1','1763','No need for rank structure in teams'
'1','1766','Get the kit and the training done ready for the next time.'
'1','1762','Can all COLP working in response to such an incident be treated the same in future
'1','1770','Graham Williams should be commended for his outstanding work at the HAC.'
'1','1726','how would this work
'1','1759','Overall I think theseus went well
'1','1772','Choose the best people for the job
'1','1757','and not just a silver QPM!'
'1','1771','That it took three weeks to deal with 56 bodies and parts
'1','1766','I am prepared to travel doing this job. Would it not be a good advert for the City to promote ourselves as an experienced DVI team
'1','1761','Training in dealing with these types of incidents should consider the police culture and taboo subjects that need to be considered and tackled in a training environment'
'1','1768','DCI Williams enjoy your retirement you earned it'
'1','1764','Does the impact on the way Stat Priority Payments are spread?'
'1','1762','Can SOI3 and DVI teams meet prior to the work in future so anunderstanding is found for one another - everyone needs to get a job done- we don&#039;t want &quot;us and them&quot;'
'1','1766','No we weren&#039;t. Quite a few dropped out at one stage or another from the team. I refer you back to the comments about what makes you proud.'
'1','1772','What&#039;s taboo?'
'1','1756','On a whole they were excellent
'1','1757','Please pass my thanks to Karen Cattermole &amp; John Hussey of CoLP Welfare'
'1','1769','You have some great staff and this identified the same. Careful on who you promote though!! Make sure we are ready next time by supporting those who are trying to ensure we are.'
'1','1762','I don&#039;t think so'
'1','1770','Been there done that
'1','1763','it worked well as it was with rank not being an issue anyone of us could and on occasions were team leader'
'1','1768','volunteers only - Im not interested 
'1','1761','Feedback from debrief to be used to learn and apply lessons for tfuture EP and CBRN types of major incidents'
'1','1765','why does this burden fall on the Economic Crime Department-why don&#039;t we train officers who are actually willing to do the job'
'1','1764','If CoLP are to continue as a Force
'1','1761','red mist and excessive risk taking'
'1','1772','We&#039;re all volunteers.'
'1','1757','why is it a secondary role in today&#039;s environment?'
'1','1766','Wasn&#039;t it a kind of perfume'
'1','1768','yes - yes - yes  fellow team members were astonished that we from colp had not been volunteers in the true sense of the word. This type of work should only be for those who want to do it.'
'1','1765','No it&#039;s a core responsibility of the post and as such we aren&#039;t volunteers. If you are a transferee you would have been asked if you were prepared to do this job and I suspect if you said no then you wouldn&#039;t have got in?'
'1','1764','This role can&#039;t really go to those on shift work as they are front line for incidents like 7/7. Where is there another pool of staff'
'1','1770','Minus
'1','1756','Yes please
'1','1771','Surely Uniform are busy doing other important roles out on the streets. We are a pool of 100 staff.'
'1','1762','Do SOCOs need to be &quot;GIS&quot; trained to assist at scenes?  City SOCOs/photographers  were told this and were turned away at Aldgate.  Two people are GIS trained now and it does not seem to bear any relevance to such a scene.  It seems COLP just weren&#039;t wanted there.'
'1','1770','At least we knew the test score'
'1','1765','I didn&#039;t see 100 ECD officers at the HAC'
'1','1763','pay those who want to be on a call out register a retainer. May sound mercinary but not meant to be'
'1','1769','How can this be a minus!! How can any body be in front of us. Have they done it in practice??'
'1','1766','I agree
'1','1770','Burden!!!! you&#039;ve done one job'
'1','1766','Only those that volunteer
'1','1756','Yeh what a winner'
'1','1769','10 days to identify all. Thats some going!!'
'1','1758','Thats not fair and quite misguided'
'1','1768','True - job done - reserve the right to refuse the next one.'
'1','1756','was you grandad in the Somme?'
'1','1772','When joining ECD it&#039;s part of the package-or is it OK for some but not special people-obviously this excludes those with good reasons not to take part.'
'1','1762','Very good comment
'1','1757','That most of us were woefully pre-trained but through no fault of departmental staff.'
'1','1757','dealing with city casualties only'
'1','1758','just what has been said'
'1','1765','That we couldn&#039;t cope on our own'
'1','1772','Put the best
'1','1759','That early on it must be established who is running the show
'1','1771','To take on board our comments before the next bombings... which are bound to come'
'1','1756','The CoLP were fantastic throughout Op Theseus and I a m proud to say I was part of it.'
'1','1762','That no where was there a specific role for Ciy SOCOs...and we really do want to be involved and have a lot of every day exposure to dead bodies..surely it would make sense to use us?'
'1','1757','Milton Ct isan unsuitable venue for similar future events'
'1','1726','how do you know they are the best and most capable'
'1','1768','Ensure that only true volunteers are involved'
'1','1770','Beg to differ... refresher courses were run last year by the Met and the City declined them'
'1','1764','The experience that has been gained from Theseus must be available to the next generation'
'1','1766','We were better trained then BTP'
'1','1759','certainly not determined by rank!!'
'1','1771','Surely the HAC will be used each time now for London.'
'1','1769','It must learn to appreciate and trust its staff more. There can not be a much bigger test of those who are prepared to stand up and be counted whatever the duty
'1','1726','so how do you know who to deploy'
'1','1765','Did Winston Churchill say that?'
'1','1769','To use Milton Court will show the COLP have learned nothing from Theseus.'
'1','1759','We were better trained than any other dvi people
'1','1771','We host the Olyimpics in 2012!!!!'
'1','1761','Yes'
'1','1762','I am bored of reading stand up and be counted'
'1','1766','Are we suggesting that for the purpose of a temporary mortuary that a new management structure be put in place so that and experienced DC supervises an in experienced DI because they have differenrt levels of experience.'
'1','1768','the package needs to be reviewed its unacceptable to do this line of work because you are told to. Its not fair on theindividual or the victim'
'1','1756','Contray to what we sometimes think
'1','1765','but that we have the staff who can be part of the Operation'
'1','1759','By making sure it is recorded somewhere who is experienced'
'1','1764','I don&#039;t think that training can prepare for the real thing
'1','1770','Call out list....simple. The Met have one . Are you on it???It&#039;s not rocket science'
'1','1757','I heard that the Inspector (N Yorks) who had lectured us and given rudimentary training on a number of ocassions was not allowed in to HAC to see the Mortuary in progress
'1','1759','no
'1','1766','I don&#039;t think any amount of extra training could prepare anyone for what we did.'
'1','1771','Yes I agree not bad for a bunch of volunteers who have never done anything like this before.'
'1','1768','I have no problems with this and dare i say it IM a Supervisor hiss spit'
'1','1765','and he&#039;s no longer a POlice Officer'
'1','1769','Would it matter.'
'1','1756','Why dont wwe use thee same systme as public order where an experinced officer acts as the tatical advisor regardless of rank.'
'1','1757','thats not a benchmark!'
'1','1756','and the Met'
'1','1766','On any future courses
'1','1770','I&#039;m in the 100 metres'
'1','1762','Well said'
'1','1772','So its fair on some other Johnny?'

'1','1775','why? when if you use the profile manager to cut down hydra.'
'1','1785','develop a hydra coding piece of software where exercise coding can be written using click boxes and option selections instead of remembering arcane coding as elitism'

'1','1790','We currently have Hydra
'1','1776','Who decides whether or not hydra is the best tool to use for a particular course.  Should it be driven by the demand of the &#039;business&#039; or should it be driven by those writing the exercises'
'1','1780','a week long or longer course to introduce Hydra and the methodology underpinning it would be useful. It would ensure consistency of initial training and bond users together. But how to fund it?'
'1','1775','duel screen for vide play/replay'
'1','1774','The &#039;changed world&#039; we now live means many others need this sort of facility. Who determines who has what?'
'1','1784','A simple system would be nice but would the time/effort/resources/money needed to achieve this be justified. At the end of the day
'1','1789','Some subject matter experts do not seem to grasp the hydra system and their facilitation works against the exercise they need an input before being let loose on the students'
'1','1792','The important issue with IL is the Immersion not the technology
'1','1782','It is important that the staff at each site follow the ethics we have always used and control their own quality'
'1','1779','Agreed - and the needs of the various users may be markedly different; this also links to the inter-agency partnership issues.'
'1','1785','on message centre
'1','1774','How do you assess in a syndicate?'
'1','1787','support (telephone) from NCALT - more formal process - call logging/responses etc'
'1','1782','Who will smack the hands of the naughty boys and girls who break the rules'
'1','1781','Pro - This can be an ideal tool to enable facilitators/assessors to monitor the progress of a student. They can identify an area which a student might need further training in.'
'1','1796','Would this require agreement at ACPO level
'1','1790','They would be easier to write and run so perhaps there would be more/better courses available.'
'1','1775','the same for facilitators and team staff'
'1','1783','The Police Service nationally has created a monster searching Income through generation to fund short falls in budget.   We have created a world where we talk about collaboration and sharing of materials and good practice
'1','1776','do you try and &#039;sell&#039; hydra to agencies that are not currently utilising it'
'1','1780','Training of facilitators depends on the exercise
'1','1777','Managers who have had hydra training have commented it would be a useful method of training to use during a team building event could it be used in this way?'
'1','1778','Might be quality assurance rather than control. Is the quality of the experience of immersive learning of a consistent standard? Could we describe the ethics and key aspects of best practice?'
'1','1791','I&#039;d like to see the creation of international exercises (not soley for the travel!). We&#039;ve now got several sites around the globe
'1','1779','That should be down to the choice and training of the facilitators
'1','1789','often rushed due to time constraints
'1','1781','Con - Student/Users will or may change the way in which they make decisions during an exercise in fear of making the wrong decision.'
'1','1785','use of rtf files instead of txt files for tasks to enable formating of feed to inprove readability and presenation'
'1','1775','who will decide if the exercise meets the standard?'
'1','1774','This will be the downfall and damage the reputation irreparably if not &#039;gripped&#039; - in the nicest possible way.'
'1','1794','Is it time to have management group (verifcation team) drawn from this group and others to carry out QA of material and delivery at various sites.'
'1','1778','Who would provide this?'
'1','1790','Have a one click button for replies to messages rather than clicking the message
'1','1775','list of played tasks'
'1','1775','cia viewer'
'1','1776','Would assesment lead to students making decisions or taking actions that they think the assessor wants to see rather than what they really want to do'
'1','1780','make the syndicate end look more up to date - that 1990s VB look belies the sophistication of Hydra'
'1','1774','Just because it exists it doesn&#039;t mean that Hydra has to be used. The appropriateness needs to be determined by the Hydra team not the Sponsor.'
'1','1782','There will have to be a number of changes to Hydra code to allow it the flexibility of Minerva and MinervaFire'
'1','1789','more realistic allowance for this by managers upgrades rushed and not fully explained'
'1','1775','task unfreeze button on server'
'1','1783','You can&#039;t inspect Quality into a product...You build it in in the first place...Quality is a measure of the staff
'1','1779','What about the non-police organisations who are now users - how does this translate across?'
'1','1781','Con - By introducing assessment this will destroy the &#039;Safe learning Environment&#039; theory which hydra is built on.'
'1','1790','Full screen video in syndicates'
'1','1792','We could also ruin the reputation Hydra has as a safe learning environment. Do we fully explain what the purpose of an immersive learning exercise is about. Taking the tools given in a formal educational environment and allowing the delegates to practise their use of the tools in a way which is not life threatening or career limitating'
'1','1785','use full screen video display and get rid of context and information
'1','1775','who controls exercise development and standards'
'1','1786','could Forces include 360&#039; appraisal into Hydra.'
'1','1774','Anyone facillitating a Hydra exercise needs training in the system but must also have an understanding of adult learning. It is apparent that many do not.'
'1','1792','Surely small potatoes as opposed to having to maintain and update 2 seperate technologies. Learning the intricasies of one system is enough.'
'1','1783','Its the pressures placed from on high that lead to poor and rushed courses
'1','1775','whos role will this be the mets or centex'
'1','1794','If we have expections of students/candidates in relation to professional competence
'1','1779','HR and management need to assess anyway - is it not time that
'1','1795','who are these loggist
'1','1778','Would we be assessing individuals against the competency framework or outcomes of the exercise or
'1','1774','CEPOL already use Hydra for disaster training and there is a huge market of CEPOL training that could be &#039;tapped&#039;.'
'1','1783','Should it not be driven by the demands and the need from a TNA...Maybe there nees to be more of a research group in this area...Some Blue Sky thinking'
'1','1791','Instead of time consuming syntax columns to complete

'1','1784','I believe that it is our job
'1','1792','What about integrating Video conferencing facilities into a suite
'1','1776','What is the standard in the first place'
'1','1789','how will the disappearance of centrex and the emergence of NPIA affect the hydra world? Will the same/better support exist?'
'1','1775','not just using the log viewer as a get out of doing any work option and not being a facilitator and becoming a cognative machine'
'1','1779','Are SOCA going to be Hydra users? If so
'1','1791','Absolutely agree. Let&#039;s make it easy and fun for us as well......'
'1','1774','The major shift needed is an understanding of what Hydra can and cannot do in terms of it&#039;s appropriate useage.'
'1','1781','Managers or major stake holders of hydra within a force don&#039;t always fully understand how Hydra works. Therefore you have the misconception that anything and everything should be delivered through the system.'
'1','1792','Or wider for marks air miles'
'1','1782','There are problems in some institutions that require them to make money to survive. NSLEC has to make money sell bed nights and charge for training Hydra has always been free or no added cost to NSLEC courses. With the changes in Centrex and the future organisation will this be allowed to continue'
'1','1779','....and how do you faciltate it effectively??'
'1','1780','Expansion needs to include expansion to different police audiences. Pressure is on for the use of immersive training to others
'1','1775','there is away around this think outside the box'
'1','1783','I&#039;m fed up with the lack of direction within force...The overuse of tick box training and the real issues are being swept over...There is a lack of engagement in quality training and the answer
'1','1785','enable streaming video and live video feed box'

'1','1796','Tricky one to adhere to when instructed to create an inappropriate exercise...'
'1','1784','I disagree. We don&#039;t need Hydra Thought Police

'1','1775','compresion of stored-arcived databases'
'1','1774','Exercises can and are mapped through learning outcomes to the competency framework. This allows effective evaluation of the training. Then consider the recipient of the training which is a wholly different area.'
'1','1795','Debriefs are often done where the facilitator/debriefer is of a lesser rank or position than students.<br />this seems to skirt around the real issues brought up in the exercise. 10k would be an asset in this instance.'
'1','1790','could 10kv be permanently incorporated within hydra?'
'1','1789','10
'1','1796','Does immersive learning have a &#039;definition&#039;'

'1','1784','Surely it is our job to educate them and assist them in the use of the tools which we provide.'
'1','1781','There needs to be two distinct routes on this subject. 1. If a course is not assessed and is a &#039;safe learning environment&#039; then the students should not be assessed or acredited in anyway. 2. If a course is &#039;designed&#039; to be used for the assessing of students then it must be made clear from the outset that this is the case.<br />Problems will occur when these two points are not clearly seperated and students get confused as to what they may be there for.'

'1','1775','can we link hydra to a web browser'
'1','1781','This would also give the opportunity for facilitors who want to be more hands on in the creation of a course to be able to do this

'1','1782','The approach should be carefuly co-ordinated
'1','1795','pseudo pods have been used for years in the military environment to great effect but due to the physical size and structure of such a facility they were not useful for trainer facilitation

'1','1778','Probably the most efficient also but does the immeriev learning team want to become part of the Training Needs Analysis team?'
'1','1791','1000% agree'
'1','1776','True but who should actually make that decision'
'1','1775','or will it be npia'
'1','1780','If the facilitators have the appropriate experience and credibility they could prevent someone who has demonstrated a lack of understanding or poor decision making in Hydra going out to make those poor decisions on serious investigations. It&#039;s an assessment or judgement call on their part
'1','1779','Why?? That&#039;s what we are there for'
'1','1783','Some great ideas here
'1','1796','What are the differences  between the 2 for the student.'
'1','1794','Would this also enable students to &#039;self reflect&#039; or I hate to use the word &#039;self assess&#039; various elements of the exercise. I know that some would use 10kv for this purpose!!!!!!!!!!!!'
'1','1792','Self assessment with a final meeting with a mentor/course facilitator that recommends further training if needed without sanction to the persons career or post would be difficult and costly to administer. NCPE have tried it out
'1','1791','The &#039;A&#039; word and Hydra should never be used in the same sentence - its that simple.'
'1','1785','if we generate better service to the public by improving the intangables such as attitude
'1','1774','Utopian ideal which may lose sight of how appropriate is the methodology for what I am trying to train?This loops back to exercise development and a thorough understanding of adult learning processes. I have run immersive learning exercises on a &#039;paper feed&#039; only.'
'1','1778','Are we making enough/any use of the learning from debriefing?'
'1','1795','the use of real injects ie telephone calls into the syndicates eg. press officer

'1','1775','trained support staff who assist in the delivery of short hydra exercises where time can not be spent traing the students to use the system'
'1','1791','wasn&#039;t this why centrex was formed?'
'1','1776','The hydra team can advise on the appropriateness but if the bosses want it done.................'
'1','1785','ah
'1','1775','should facilitators be trained trainers?'
'1','1778','Only matters if you want to get an NVQ'
'1','1781','More specific training in areas of creating material for a hydra exercise. What is the best video codecs to use? Are jpegs better than bmp files? What are the limitations. What shouldn&#039;t be done and what is best practice.'
'1','1779','and a print button for the photos. BTW can we have intelligent windows for photos and maps to re-size rather that having to fiddle about converting original images??'
'1','1796','Do we need a better central register of exercises
'1','1792','The methodolgy if run correctly is totally different. They both require the same degree of attention to realistic detail to ensure immersion
'1','1785','there appears to be air miles here'
'1','1781','We have a manual on how to use Hydra
'1','1784','&#039;most effective tool&#039;... surely it will not cover every training need! It is another tool in our box and we need a range of spanners for all the different nuts out there.'
'1','1783','Then the problem should be dealt with not compounded....Charging for the use of facilities is fine and a reasonable decision
'1','1773','remember the ownership of Hydra and Minerva is the Met. Police
'1','1782','Who evaluates the ntof the home office and its self appointed quangos.Are we trying to please a master that doesn&#039;t know what it wants. It is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of Hydra training through the usual (cost effective method) Try following a student for 6 months after a course and see if they demonstrate a number of cleverly created and justifyable tick box emotions and actions'
'1','1795','how would this improve the experience for the student. or are you trying to overwhelm them.'
'1','1775','you have lost the point of the boxes'
'1','1780','This goes to the key area of committed facilitators who have credibility in their field - ideally designing and leading exercises
'1','1774','If that is the case why hasn&#039;t it done so already?'
'1','1784','Never entered my head. Just thinking about preseving the ethos of immersive learning and gaining expertese myself. I don&#039;t care where i do it.'
'1','1779','Not neccessarily - I think it&#039;s a personality thing
'1','1773','this is a feature already in the system please ask JJ to explain how to use this'
'1','1795','nearly every graphics card out there will only support video on the primary monitor
'1','1781','All courses will eventually be backed by Universities as NVQs etc. This is part of the governments idea of gaining qualifications whilst in the work force'
'1','1775','with a single comunication print'
'1','1783','Point well made and why the Centrex QA process should be put in the dustbin...Why did Centrex build a QA model when BSI had one on the shelf in the first place...Empire creation!'
'1','1773','not the resize though - that is true'
'1','1782','What would the techies do then to make themselves feel more superior'
'1','1787','surely it can be left up to an individual site to make the most of it&#039;s Hydra investment.  Will it really reflect nationally on the Hydra brand if there is a (unintentional) less than perfect use by someone&#039;s standard ?'
'1','1784','I was thinking more about QA the implementation of the methodologies rather that the course material.'
'1','1775','when will there be a hand book'
'1','1785','you can lead a horse to water but cannot force it to drink
'1','1779','The reference point is increasingly Skills for Justice I&#039;m afraid'
'1','1782','I agree that paper feeds are not irrelivant in training
'1','1778','But lots of learning will always be developmental rather than specifically assessed'
'1','1774','We cannot avoid the fact that we are in a world and a future where YOU will have to justify your Hydra training and &#039;prove&#039; it is effective in competing for funds and resources. To deny this is sand and head burying. We need to be more open
'1','1791','Come and see the Negotiators siege exercse at Hendon for immersion using &#039;live&#039; inputs!'
'1','1784','But do you know why?'
'1','1783','ANYONE USING HYDRA FOR ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE USER GROUP AND HAVE THEIR LICENCE WITHDRAWN...ASSESSMENT WILL BRING DOWN HYDRA! (yes I am shouting!)'
'1','1789','according to Jacques Yves Cousteau it means jumping in and not being afraid to get your feet or hair wet !<br />anyone who has seen the most cynical of students &quot;sucked in&quot; to a hydra exercise the moment the first information comes up on the syndicate sceen will not worry about definitions'
'1','1786','does it capture emotions ?'
'1','1781','The &#039;A&#039; word being? Assessment? Accreditation? Analysing? Surely there is different levels which need to be fully explored. Nothing is that black and white?'
'1','1773','this is a key question and we need to think of ways to get analysis back into design JC'
'1','1776','The difficulty with self assessment is the requirement to be honest with yourself and we all know that there are many people who think they are doing just fine when it is blatantly apparent to all around them that they are not.'
'1','1780','Hydra would be such a useful environment to highlight individuals who display poor group-working
'1','1784','Yes
'1','1779','No
'1','1794','I would suggest - No. When do the teams from across the country who actually run the exercises get together to debrief a case study. We are all doing it a different way and to differing standards. Effective case scenario bebriefs would also contribute to the overall enhancment of HYDRA.'
'1','1778','Perhaps you are shouting because this matters and whatever the outcome needs a more informed debate?'
'1','1792','And Video conferencing
'1','1783','Hydra is about an environment where...&quot;I can try something and if it works talk about it...as well as...Trying something
'1','1787','also - make the number of syndicates dispayed configurable.  Half of left screen is wasted if only running with 3 syndicates'
'1','1781','What about the different areas of assessment
'1','1774','There should be no confusion. Hydra should not be used as an &#039;assessment centre&#039; this will irrevocably alter the students perception and &#039;skew&#039; any so called &#039;findings&#039;.'
'1','1778','How does/ can the MLE support Hydra for forces?'
'1','1775','then put hydra on the second screen
'1','1791','Presumably you&#039;ve seen SMoCIT?'
'1','1783','If they don&#039;t they need to wake up and smell the coffee!'
'1','1789','only if they are based abroad and Ican fly from Stansted (easy distance from Newmarket)'
'1','1779','No
'1','1785','firstly thsi methodology has not been explained   secondly this should be automatic not optional to increase the oomph of a feed.   By asking someone to actively alter the presentation you surely pop the bubble of immersion'
'1','1775','we do that any way not quite the same as having a full screen view'
'1','1796','Its just a case of using one system in different ways
'1','1779','It can do - is that a bad thing?'
'1','1774','Students are &#039;observed&#039; in a non-threatening and &#039;remote&#039; way so it is possible to give personal feedback on what was observed - not an assessment or conclusion of what they did
'1','1795','the creation of an exercise is down to supply and demand but how are other Simulated Operations units to be made aware that an exercise is currently being produced by &#039;X&#039;. there is currently only a small number of cross unit traffic.<br />are commanders aware what is being created in their own force let alone externally. it would appear not!'
'1','1791','and Jim&#039;s!'
'1','1783','NO
'1','1775','use dual screen'
'1','1779','It should be business driven
'1','1781','And this will form part of the overall training of an induvidual who will eventually achieve some sort of qualification. Whether they realised at the time that it actually is helping them achieve that. On this basis Hydra training/learning will need to bear that in mind.'
'1','1791','Far better than &#039;threads&#039; on a web site - more interactive
'1','1782','Fortunately there are people with vision and guts that can see that something is right. They don&#039;t need a finacial breakdown or cost per student. They can see the value in Hydra by watching it and appreciating the learning that takes place. When the person with the vision is a leader
'1','1773','lets have some honesty here! who is using Hydra as an assessment tool
'1','1776','I like this idea
'1','1778','Is the trick is to make evaluation and quality assuarnce quite light  touch but systematic?'
'1','1794','A great idea
'1','1782','Yes we need one'
'1','1785','the point of the boxes is to tell the students where they are and who is talking to them and why
'1','1779','So why not have a HUG list of &#039;approved facilitators&#039; across the board. Is there any reason why a Met DAC can&#039;t facilitate a Customs course (please?) or vice-versa? Facilitation is as much about people skills - JC&#039;s emotional intelligence - as it is about intimate subject knowledge'
'1','1775','we turn prospective customers away who whant assesment
'1','1776','It&#039;s arse covering - which is what 90% of training seems to be about these days'
'1','1784','If you understand the methodologies of Hydra and Minerva you would not consider using them for assessment in the same way that you don&#039;t apply the brakes when you want to move forward. That doesn&#039;t mean that assessment can not be used on a course in which Hydra is a part.'
'1','1782','Agreed
'1','1774','You don&#039;t need to shout but a reasoned debate about and understanding of what is and is not being &#039;assessed&#039; is needed. Observed behaviour brought to the attention of a student is developmental. Surely that&#039;s what we are trying to do? Hydra and Minerva&#039;s origins are in &#039;games playing&#039; but it&#039;s a bit more serious than that isn&#039;t it?'
'1','1792','Then apply the same evaluation techniques as ordinary boring class based learning. Provided that it is more than a check test examination which generally only test the students ability to regurgitate written word
'1','1779','No. You&#039;re thinking with your pointy hat on again. There are other users apart from the police - are you confident that you can accurately and meaningfully assess their methodologies
'1','1780','It is naive to expect Command Teams not to want to ensure that an expensive facility like a Hydra suite isn&#039;t used as much as possible
'1','1775','view
'1','1796','Yes
'1','1791','good one'
'1','1783','Why do we have to prove anything...Is it not about providing quality effectine learning?...I (we) don&#039;t have to do anything...The purpose of quality systems is to ensure that the product that was design meets its specification
'1','1792','Bit simplicistic i believe'
'1','1778','Who should be having this discussion? Are we the right people to make this decision?'
'1','1785','ensure the jpg / mpg window is always a standard window size not a jumble of numbers picked out of the air'
'1','1795','the light has come on'
'1','1781','Again thats black &amp; White. What if an induvidual clearly needs further training in a certain area that may have become apparent during a hydra exercise. Could a facilitator not monitor that (gives them a &#039;heads up&#039; so to speak) so that later on when that induvidual is still undertaking training within a different area that is not within hydra. The facilitator can help focus the training for that induvidual into the key areas which need improving?'
'1','1794','If people are complying to the concept of the new SIO development programme. The workplace assessment should be completed before then attend the HYDRA simulation. This would ensure that HYDRA is NOT USED for assessemnt purposes.'
'1','1773','this is a little patronising! the philosophy is based around complexity &#039;games playing&#039; belittles that complexity and deisgn a lot of thinking has gone into self assessment and not turning hydra into a assessment centre'
'1','1782','I like happy sheets they make me feel good'
'1','1774','If we can&#039;t discuss this then who else is qualified to?'
'1','1773','no no no no'
'1','1784','The fact that this question has been asked absolutely justifies my arguement that we need to fully understand what we have got before we try to use it. We need to understand the methodologies. I think the number of people who really understand is very small (possible only one if you really think about it - has anyone read his thesis???)'
'1','1775','if hydra gets over used it will become like &quot;death by powerpoint&quot; has become a turn off'
'1','1773','leave assessment centres out of the equation altogether Assessment is not learning Hydra is'
'1','1795','the minimum specifications for hydra upgrades needs to be looked at.<br />are all components of windows xp
'1','1779','I agree but I am a realist. All of our organisations need assessment for various purposes. Hydra is - or could be - the best way of doing it. If we don&#039;t let them use Hydra they will use something not as good. Is that what you want? I also think it is naive to think that students perfomance on Hydra will not be revisited in the event of a Public Enquiry or simiar where the competence of a student that had attended a Hydra event became an issue'
'1','1785','think outside the box is not helpful
'1','1791','I can understand JC wishing to be careful how/where/when 10KV is used - but perhaps a &#039;10Kv lite&#039; version (say
'1','1782','Agreed - I will run the project can we be based in Las Vegas
'1','1778','The SIO Programme incorporates Immersive Learning and other types of learning but SIOs are then assessed later against NOS in the workplace as result of the overall course. Thus th I/L is allowed to be developmental but still linked to assessment'
'1','1776','For the students it all centres around the  credibility of the facilitator - this approach may work but there is a large probability that students will not take to being facilitated by someone from outside the job'
'1','1781','Your last sentance here I think is very true and where people are getting confused about assessment. Using assessment on course which includes Hydra (but the induvidual is not assessed on the Hydra Exercise)

'1','1800','In this case the truth of what happened seemed obvious from the video.  What we never learned
'1','1798','Political considerations drove only the speed of the case Not the outcome BUT many people will not believe that.  Thus

'1','1815','Much of what we (LAPD) hold as `truth` amounts to verbal accounts of what happened. This often bears little or no resemblance to the truth and is filled with subjectivity and bias.'
'1','1798','Trust is elusive in these events.  The community is not one set of answers or opinions.  Rather
'1','1810','thoroughness and need to act
'1','1800','I think we did a lot of things right and can take what we learned to the next major case.  Videotaping of interviews should be the rule
'1','1809','But for the video
'1','1811','We need to remain removed from any pressure or perceptions on the part of politicians.  We need to remain an independent investigative body who seeks out the truth of what happened regardless of what might be the wishes of the politicians for the results'
'1','1808','Interesting trying to balance what are obviously conflicting demands.  There will always be those outside the org that will seocnd guess us no matter what we do.  We certainly have the ability tto heave more impact on the trust of our own people.'

'1','1798','The discipline was tailored to the various parties very carefully BUT there are very few people involved in this case or that look at this case that see that.'
'1','1810','Too many times I suspect that the &quot;organizational learning&quot; that takes place occurs within divisions or bureaus - there is much to be learned from sharing this learning outside of the workgroup immeidately affected.'
'1','1801','This case was the first time we had an associate advocate involved (monitoring) interviews of accused officers at the front-end of the investigation.  I think we could have done a better job of identifying roles and strategy.  Specifically

'1','1808','If you lose your objectivity in these casesyou are toast.   But there were times in this inv where the objectivity of some of the players was impacted.'

Interesting because this was a &quot;defense&quot; board.<br />No one expected the first officer to be fired but that outcome should have been expected IF you listened to the testimony of the Board and the rationale.'
'1','1801','Because the joint interview was a first
'1','1808','When management looks at a case of this magnitude they have to recognize that there will be consequences for what ever the outcome is.  In this case people recognized early onthe high visibility of his case andstayed true to the mission:  the truth of the matter.'
'1','1811','Actually
'1','1815','Timeliness does not necessarily imply that the investigation must be `rushed` in a fashion that detracts from the quality. We are so urgency driven in our organization that we believe we function at our best when we are driven by extremes and not by our own sense of diligence.'

'1','1801','Those involved in this (in any role) must remember that the Chief of Police is the ultimate disciplinarian
'1','1808','Well many people within the Department think that the outcome was predetermined.  We know it wasn&#039;t
'1','1810','Investigators who are not aware of their own emotional reaction to cases run the risk of being unduly
'1','1815','Objectivity is a worthy goal that tends to fluctuate during the course of an investigation. A good investigator keeps checking himself for unintended bias throughout the investigation and asks other to help him in this regard.'

'1','1809','The community should hear that the officer&#039;s actions were excessive.  But to what degree
'1','1816','how does he or she know that the advice they are getting is unbiased?'
'1','1800','We actually did that in the second round of interviews.  But it was a challenge to balance the rights of the officers with the feelings of the investigators.  In the end
'1','1810','We have to be honest here - are we talking about discipline or punishment? If we mean discipline
'1','1808','But was this case handled correctly by the division from its inception?  Was it truly a categorical UOF or was it a non-cat?  What type of learning took place on that isue.'
'1','1798','A core learning was that perception is more important than reality.  Many of the investigators with the greastest knowledge of the case felt that Hale was the worst guy
'1','1808','Did that happen here...I don&#039;t thinkso.'
'1','1811','At some point yes but with the way things are in LA with some individuals in the community
'1','1797','When the dept becomes involved in a highly publicized incident
'1','1800','With no video
'1','1801','Investigators and advocates need to understand each others roles and recognize that at different points of the investigation and/or adjudication ownership and roles change.  During the investigation the advocates role is to support via advise and assistance (framing questions
'1','1808','How did that happen?  With all fo the meetings we held and the belief that we run an open shop why wasn&#039;t this concern addressed'
'1','1809','The level of courage necessary to stand up to vocal elements in the community is sometimes rare.  We all know that telling the truth concerning the force officers use is a dangerous political trap.  The safe play is to avoid the issue
'1','1799','Keep the officers and the community informed of the investigation.  However
'1','1808','We may have missd the boat on that but who did we need to tell?  We had the LAPPL in early on and shared as much as we could have without compromising the inv.'
'1','1800','There was pressure
'1','1815','No one in my 30 year history with the Department has done a better job than the current COP to mitigate &#039;perceptions&#039; by heading them off with the truth or at least bits of truth interspersed with direction and leadership objectives. Whatever fallout comes from the Miller is bound to be far less than it was with any previous COP.'
'1','1801','This is an area were we all need to be careful.  When we become actively involved in cases
'1','1798','And isn&#039;t that the core challenge?  How to change the public perception of the LAPD?  How to change the public&#039;s idea about the investigation  How to change the public&#039;s perception about the incident?  About the department?'
'1','1808','The COP kept now president of the Police Commission John Mack apprised of the status of the inv.  WHO ELSE DO WE BRING IN...dANNY bAKEWELL
'1','1815','At what point can a confidential (personnel) investigation become an open book learning turtorial for others to use in a learning mode? There are considerations for privacy and protection that often stymie the best learning experience. Even if PSB members working here now learn something valuable
'1','1799','Making sure all involved Department investigators and managers keep an open mind to suggestions no matter the rank.'
'1','1808','This is about noth.  Modifying behavior is the discipline piece and firing or suspension days is about the punishmnet piece.'
'1','1797','The decision on the type of UOF category had not been decided until the UOF was written almost a yr after the incident.  We had a UOF system in place and at one point because of the high profile incident
'1','1808','How do we do that?  If there is so much pressure how can we control negative responses to it?  Didn&#039;t we fall victim to that ourselves?'
'1','1801','If our goal remains to focus on the &quot;process&quot; and not the &quot;outcomes&quot; then transparency in the investigation in more important than advisory
'1','1809','If that is true
'1','1816','do they have a place to ensure that the investigation remains objective and unbiased?'
'1','1808','We have an obligation to share what we learn.  PSB is more that just IA inv.'
'1','1815','I think our Department could benefit from the experience of connecting employees to their roles as community members and citizens with an expectation of responsiveness from their City government. So few Dept. employees live in the CIty that they don&#039;t experience it at all as citizens (or customers).'
'1','1799','Yes there is
'1','1800','I struggled to find the right word
'2','0','communication between the department and the wider LAPD'
'1','1808','Yes there was a lack of knowledge about what was happening.  Most C/Os did attend roll calls and discussed what happened.  But we at PSB can&#039;t share details while the case is active
'1','1801','The COP recognized the importance of this issue and he immediately prepared a Code 20 video that was broadcast to the rank-and-file the same day.  Additionally
'2','0','Racism'
'1','1808','I must have missed that one'
'1','1809','The loudest message heard by officers who are out fighting with criminals today was that if their actions result in political pressure
'1','1801','The COP was thoughtful with his remarks to the press
'2','0','Impact of the Media'
'1','1808','As soon as it was shown I knew it would have racial overtones.  That is one of the reasons it was so high profile so quickly.  Then add the Devon Brown shooting to the mix and the rest is history.'
'1','1811','This is very important especially after the impact that past high profile cases such as Eula Love and Rodney King have had on the workforce.  Some portion of information needs to be disseminated to the rest of the Department
'1','1800','The community has its role as the civilian representative at the board.  When that started the officers thought the civilian board members would be the harshest.  Just the opposite proved to be true.'
'1','1801','The issue of race did come up during the issues raised between the advocates and the investigators
'1','1808','Ah yes our friends in the media.  It certainly was interesting that we needed a subpoena to get the video from both stations so we could get to the truth of the matter.<br />Never lose sight of the fact that the media will do everything it can to kep an item like this is on the front page.'
'1','1810','Just look how we were hesitant to even suggest that this might be an issue to discuss in this format'
'1','1811','This became a very important aspect of this case due to the increased accessiblity of not only Department personnel but community groups and activists.  The media tends to not report facts or reports them with a spin and that has a huge impact on the workforce and its relationship with the community.'
'1','1801','By continually reminding the community that this was about process
'1','1808','Why was that the case?  The quick response was good but why did it get to that point?  Were we insensitive to that fact?'
'1','1808','Who was responsible for brining it up?'
'1','1801','I don&#039;t think we are as insensitive as we have become hyper-sensitive.  The reality is that we all have our own perseptions surrounding race
'1','1808','Who was responsible for bringing it up within PSB?'
'2','0','if this inicdent was to occur tomorrow what needs to be different?'
'1','1801','Better communication and role defining for those involved in the investigation and adjudication.'
'1','1810','Communications from the dept (&amp; cop) to the community that we are working the case
'1','1808','Need to be more sensitive to who was assigned to assume inv responsibility. Due to the pressure that was put on all of the involved parties more discussion about it.<br />More inclusion of all of the players in debrieifing.<br />HYDRA would be helpful through out the process.'
'1','1799','Immediate communicaton between investigators and management to determine the direction of the investigation.'
'1','1800','This snowballed from the beginning
'1','1809','Perhaps a definitive decision
'1','1808','Provide better updates to the COC C/Os on what we know so they can address the issues within their own commands.'
'1','1810','With the many references to how &quot;emotional&quot; this case was
'1','1801','Thoughtfully design the investigative team
'1','1808','Assign a BSS psychologist on these high profile cases.'
'1','1801','The COP should not have made the comments about removing the flashlight publicly as he did.  He should have taken the emotion out of it by advising the rank-and-file of the reasons why prior to stating it publicly.'
'1','1800','There was one assigned - to the accused officers.  The emotional well-being of the investigators was not considered.  And I doubt any of us would even entertain the idea that we could use the help.'

'1','1810','this is critical.  There is a need to rotate members of the lieutenant rank or captains within commands to provide greater experience levels'

'1','1807','This is a historical problem within the Department and many believe the current CEDP mandated type training is less than valuable. Much of this is mandated and therefore a moot point.  To make training meaningful for a large organization it should be de-centralized

This system would have a great application in many areas of our department.  There is a fear to say the king is not wearing any clothes
'1','1808','There needs to be clear guidelines and expectations as to what is required learning during the promotional probationary periods.  For example there are those that have passed detective probation that have never been to trial or written a search warrant.

'1','1806','The Lieutenant rank is the important transition between the cops and management.  There has to be a by-in by Lts.'

This Department tends not to look to outside resources for training and as a result we are not taking full advantage of learning from the experiences of other departments.   We should implement more training opportunities outside our organization to broaden our perspective.'

'1','1807','The police deparment is driven by what the community wants.  This is inevitable but we have to be responsive.  The difficult road is recognizing what the community

'1','1807','Those persons that are afraid to make decisions should not be decision makers.  We must hold our subordinates accountable if they don&#039;t have the guts to stand up and take a side on an issue.'
'1','1815','Yes
'1','1801','trng shouldn&#039;t last for just a couple of hours and then be forgotten.  There needs to be some type of opportunity to keep it fresh in the supervisor&#039;s mind so he can draw upon it when needed.'

'1','1811','Disagree.  I see more creativity today than in any years past.  In past
'1','1801','teach them its okay to make a decision and not fear reprisal from the top.  Many command staff decisions seem to be made or not made because they fear they will be disgraced

'1','1806','There is a tremendous shift in thinking in the organization.  The new Chief and the upper management for the most part have become key in creating a forward thinking management team.  We are not there yet

It needs to be rewarded and sought out agressively at all levels of the organization.  We have a saying in this organization .... We do it this way because we always have..... THat should never be repeated'

'1','1850','Lack of inspiration/lack of commercial awareness'
'1','1845','Walking the Talk - I don&#039;t believe people go out of their way not to do something. There are clearly barriers stopping people responding to others.'
'1','1843','Do the MPA know where we are wishing to go as an organisation as this will need funds that they are unwilling to provide'
'1','1853','How many times have I seen our leaders nod their head to an idea and the do nothing at all? How many actually take action? How many say &#039;well done&#039;?'
'1','1859','i think the public response to how we acted on 7/7 shows that we do still police and we have the backing of the public.'
'1','1851','I think the organisation is in danger of losing the respect of the public it serves because of endless discussions/programmes of this nature. At a time when we are at a heightened state of alert I think the people of London would view this process with a great deal of cynicism'
'1','1850','Values shouls carry equal importance as performance ability at PDR'
'1','1852','Lets get rid of the dead wood and &quot;old values&quot; and start working together.  There is a solution
'1','1861','performance data
'1','1853','Police staff status? What status?'
'1','1865','this is ok
'1','1860','did you paid for the 12 hours if not why not'
'1','1854','Where do Govt turn to when they need to kick ass?  Immigration? Do they turn to IND? No
'1','1849','Itis interesting that your comments about hours worked are raised in connection to Police Staff.  What happened to team met?'
'1','1845','Sometimes &#039;politics&#039; is used as an excuse for inaction. Assumptions are made and not challenged.'
'1','1859','why do we still make the distincion between police oficers and police staff and why do we continue to require police officers to wear uniform inside offices and when not meeting the publc?'
'1','1852','Supervision is too laxed
'1','1843','ACPO ranks have achieved success by transactional leadership so will they support the signigicant change in leadership style or will they just protect themselves and talk the talk not walk the walk'
'1','1848','This organisation has a presentee culture
'1','1854','We&#039;re unbeatable at the big stuff...It&#039;s the day to day bread and butter we need to improve on.'
'1','1840','Too much change when new senior managers change and impose their bright ideas'
'1','1839','stick to plain english'
'1','1859','you make me want to come to work guv!'
'1','1851','I don&#039;t think the MPA live in the real world. They are politicians who are there purely to pursue their own careers/re-election. I don&#039;t think they have a very good grasp of reality'
'1','1847','Thank God that now
'1','1860','I think we are still supported by the silent majority and do the job very well'
'1','1856','value performance
'1','1852','Very few have pride and passion now in the Met.'
'1','1844','People in this room are now transfixed on the computer screens......not on the speaker...........so what is his value ?'
'1','1856','This is not working.'
'1','1853','We seem to do the big &#039;front page&#039; things extremely well. The normal day-to-day business sems to get forgotten. Look at the Constabularies performance figures. We are close to the bottom of the league.'
'1','1845','What are the reasons for people losing that &#039;drive&#039; that they started with?'
'1','1857','Consistency between managers! whatever next????'
'1','1859','Why has it become necessary to spell out our values? Does society need to be taught values?'
'1','1850','when police staff are subjected to the same operational pressures and stresses as police officers and when they are subject to the same discipline code as us
'1','1865','this is ok because the speaker has set up the session to deal with the issues
'1','1864','Performance indicators that do not measure quality and focus on short term crude measures without acknowledgement of the complexities of policing will always be barriers to living these values.'
'1','1849','Font too smallto read from here'
'1','1848','Are people afraid to challenge behaviour because they feel they will nt be suppoted?'
'1','1851','I think the performance figures are a little unfair
'1','1856','Sorry.......never experienced this from senior management'
'1','1859','when you have to state what we will not do you creative a negative aspect to this process.'
'1','1839','stop moaning and get on with the job like the rest of us'
'1','1852','Instead of giving in to public opinion
'1','1858','We can&#039;t expect the public&#039;s perception to change until we deal with internal issues.  The answer comes from within.'
'1','1843','I have had bitter personal experience of challenging.I have had my legs done. I will never do it again.'
'1','1861','Sorry
'1','1860','why should we'
'1','1855','I agree.  There are still to many dinosaurs out there who cannot bring theselves into the 21st century'
'1','1852','Any change that goes against the &quot;norm&quot; gets challenged or stopped.  No one is listening.'
'1','1865','why shouldn&#039;t we?'
'1','1859','good luck on making an impact on command level'
'1','1854','Challenge upwards?  Do they still summon SMT members to TPHQ for a bashing up - COMPSTAT?  How about a Supt giving the AC some feedback at one of those meetings.  Do you think it would be well received?'
'1','1841','Happy with values
'1','1852','There are over 13
'1','1858','There are only very few bad apples.. most people I have worked with have the sames values as me ..'
'1','1855','Don&#039;t we have the &#039;sir&#039; and &#039;madam&#039; because the MPS is still supposed to be a disciplined force?'
'1','1866','little people management skills provided'
'1','1856','If you respect and value your staff and give rewards along the way
'1','1860','are we not working well..............'
'1','1839','The service needs to maintain discipline
'1','1845','I have only attended courses that are compulsory for all
'1','1854','Until they get GATSO&#039;d'
'1','1859','if you come to work because of the people you work with you must have a masocistic streak.'
'1','1840','Bashed to of them by poor managers.  We need some leaders who inspire!'
'1','1855','totally agree.  I do it and it works'
'1','1856','I think I need 10
'1','1841','Perhaps not equal
'1','1843','How can you control and regulate 30
'1','1852','Why do we bother with PDR&#039;s if a person is under performing then sort it out when it&#039;s happening 
'1','1846','The change from a force to a service should be about the way we relate to each other and the public
'1','1851','I very much agree with this statement. I don&#039;t think police staff are valued highly enough by the organisation. The service is still highly officer focused.'
'1','1845','Why do we go external for faciliation/consultants? We have 40
'1','1842','why not consider that you may never get it right? an organisation of 40
'1','1866','too Rank Band driven - lack of equality in the workplace'
'1','1849','more external consultants will just soak up vast amounts of our limited budget and what extra do they bring?'
'1','1839','Why have we all of a sudden become &quot;Cops&quot; instead of police officers???'
'1','1852','Why bring in external consultants (at a massive cost to the service) where there are peoplem within the Met that can assist and give you the benefit of their experience from within.'
'1','1859','lets stop trying to re-invent the wheel and look at oher successful organisations
'1','1851','Because this system never worked
'1','1860','evry thing going really well
'1','1850','funny that! Police service that focuses on police officers. whatever next?'
'1','1841','Agree with external accreditation.'
'1','1852','PDR&#039;s maybe required - to monitor an officer/staff&#039;s peformance.  BUT they are never done on time
'1','1847','You&#039;re understanding of the PDR system is wrong. It is a &#039;living document&#039; and performance issues should be dealt with at the time. It is not like the APA procedures!!'
'1','1845','I agree. I&#039;m sure Met people will understand the issues much better than external consultants
'1','1849','Many staff have already gained these qualifactions but are ignored in favour of External Consultants.  This is a double waste of money.'
'1','1848','Peolpe will put themselves first and the organisation second until the service recognises people in a tangible way for delivering a quality of service to the public.  Currently your earnings are primarily effected by promotion or the amount of time you are &#039;booked on&#039;.  What rewards do we give to people who provide a very high quality of service in their current role during their rostered working day?'
'1','1860','but where is the uniform officer on the street  where the PUBLIC who pays us wants to see us dealing with THEIR problems'
'1','1854','Time for a bit of honesty.  There&#039;s no such thing as altruism.  We&#039;re all come to work for what&#039;s in it for ourselves.  If you want me to buy in - tell me what&#039;s in it for me.'
'1','1844','Sat in this room being asked to think outside the box !!!'
'1','1859','this process should have a degree of professional academic phrases as we need to become a part of the dialogue which occurs across the professional development community nationally and worldwide.'
'1','1842','Are u talking to the Crime Academy - they are also developing external accreditations and conducting on-line training?'
'1','1852','Why after twenty three years service are my details still being inputted incorrectly?  TOPSY/PIMS/MET HR.  the system do&#039;s not work
'1','1861','Web forums???  aware is too restrictive with its firewall if you have the word bum deal it will pick up the first word and block and send a report to the firewall manager
'1','1858','I don&#039;t think this applies to everyone.  Certainly not my personal experience...'
'1','1853','PoliceStaff are still second-class citizens. The Met talks a good talk but has never delivered on this major issue
'1','1855','will we go back to a single training department.  I work in training but even I can&#039;t get to grips with all the different units/academies/silos
'1','1854','Well done for standing up there and giving it your best.  That was a thankless task and you did it well.'
'1','1840','Can we get rid of the Old boy network
'1','1861','have tried for 6 months to get officers on a course'
'1','1866','great ideas but with the size of this organisation how long will this take to role out to everyone?'
'1','1845','If we introduce the Leadership courses as well as the management courses
'1','1852','You can provide all the development training tyou want for band D and Sergeants.  B ut a the end of the day
'1','1860','whats wrong with disipline'
'1','1840','No one will give Police staff status
'1','1861','can the phrase
'1','1842','i agree i think people need consistency from the mps - this leads to confidence in the organisation and therefrom loyalty'
'1','1858','get some glasses !'
'1','1852','Grevience and other processes takes too long!'
'1','1859','I disagree that leadership begins when you first join. I believe that those selected have the qualities to take control of a situation but do not begin to lead until they enter the promotion arena or supervise others'
'1','1845','I think this is a good idea
'1','1854','What get measured gets done.  Whether the public like it or not.'
'1','1850','Senior managers do not recognise the expertise held within their depts - all too often technical people are forced into doing Admin roles and not utilising their core skills. Overall provides a very poor allocation of scarce resources.'
'1','1844','No.............we work for our own self gains not for the good of others.....that is the culture this job breeds........change that and we may have a fighting chance.'
'1','1853','What do we do to consult our customer THE PUBLIC? The people who we are supposed to protect and serve? When they are asked we don&#039;t like the answers!'
'1','1864','first line managers may benefit from contacts with forward thinking private companies .'
'1','1845','So
'1','1860','whats COMPSTAT'
'1','1861','no officers have the Queens Commision like Army Officers
'1','1859','why do staff think it is appropriate to attend events like this in jeans
'1','1846','How can people work to common goals when so many are worried about their jobs with the service review and budget saving exercises?'
'1','1839','It will not improve until the new breed of senior officer emerges'
'1','1851','This is exactly the sort of thing the service needs to overcome if it is going to recruit highly trained/motivated people as staff. The officer first culture is extremely damaging to the service&#039;s ability to recruit appropriately trained people.'
'1','1843','Surely with a change of culture you could feel confident to try again otherwise this whole process is worthless'
'1','1859','i agree with you
'1','1864','Each Borough or OCU must have a champion that moves these issues on or they will fail'
'1','1840','Too many levels of management that all seem to have diffirent messages to send out'
'1','1845','external mentoring is very useful. It takes you out of the situation and gives you a very different perspective. This would also enhance relations with outside organisations. However
'1','1853','This Commissioner is trying hard to achieve change but it is like steering a battleship thro&#039; heavy seas and trying to turn without capsizing. There is too much cynicism in the Met.'
'1','1858','I second that !'
'1','1841','I think this comment unfair.  Many people do see the value.  The sample size is sufficiently large to indicate what MPS staff think and that people care enough to complete the survey in the first place.'
'1','1843','That champion must be the OCU commander otherwise destined to fail'
'1','1867','another new set of clothes for the king.  The fundamental problem remains.  Insufficient budget to provide a professional response
'1','1859','i think no disrespect to the values was intended only tha manner in which they have not been effectively communicated and intergrated across the mps.'
'1','1868','Most people I have spoken to think that we&#039;re doing a great job.  We should build on our successes
'1','1856','Great....please encourage more managers to follow suit'
'1','1861','I agree to a point mandatory training is easy to get on as it is a statistic of perfomance management and OCU commanders dont like explaining why their Offciers are not up to date
'1','1858','They do
'1','1844','Yes.........he will get all the support he needs........I think not...........history just repeats itself in this job.'
'1','1842','why do different people join the mps? some are officers
'1','1860','Theres a lot of big words in the police service what do they mean this squad and hat squad lets get the officers back on the street with support be it help with paper work transport etc etc'
'1','1866','any comments/grievances made to your line magr are not private - they have to be rpeorted'
'1','1859','nothing were it is appropriate but a lot of damage has been done in the past.'
'1','1855','not in my experience they are not.'
'1','1854','That&#039;s what the CCRU do now
'1','1866','PDR rubbish - comments I made were never acrted on. Your our not rewarded for good performance'
'1','1859','i do not mind what you call me as long as my rank is shown on my pay packet
'1','1857','Fully agree
'1','1859','respect and support has to extend to when errors are made
'1','1857','Support in terms of training also needs to be available and timely.'
'1','1859','Be flexible and make differences work for you'
'1','1857','Time needs to be available to be able to provide support.'
'1','1858','I agree .. but some people just don&#039;t listen'
'1','1842','Encourage positive thinking and provide training for the individual'
'1','1873','Everybody has a skill
'1','1842','Thinking outside the box and willing to look and explore new ways of looking at experiences'
'1','1845','The course would have a coaching element to it. Team members will be trained to coach each other
'1','1842','Provide training for the individual to enable them to deal with negativity and &#039;anti&#039; mentality in a &#039;team&#039; situation.'
'1','1840','We need some good examples of listening and responding
'1','1859','when a challenging mangerial issue occurs leaders need to be given time to devote to solutions
'1','1855','We must learn to acknowledge positive and developmental experiences before we can learn from them. Any training must start from here.'

The course would incorporate role play exercises that would maybe include a demonstration of a poor interview and include feed back. There would be a large focus on freedom of speech. There should be an obligation for senior management managment to actively participate. There should be a section on the roles and responsibilities of line managers.The course could also benefit from a view of management from outside the service

'1','1856','Group to agree what the statement at the top means by quality policing.  Perhaps explore how it can mean different things to different people
'1','1851','Roleplay exercises would form a perfect basis for the course this would be a matter that would underscore service policy. The exercise should include a demonstration of something or a situation being done poorly. Attendees would then be asked to comment on what is being done. A scenario could be devised where someone has come up with an alternative way to do something
'1','1876','In terms of training product
'1','1875','Give me Churchillian envagelism!!'

'1','1852','Maintain and promote a career/skils  promotion pathway.  By encouraging people with the right skills to stay in and develop into a chosen pathway.  although a ubiquitus officer helps the met as a whole specialists in the role would achieve more results of a hugher quality.'

'1','1859','team working is more achievable when you understand the role of others.
'1','1851','An exercise could be included where the group can create the perfect manager/leader. They would discuss the principles of leadership. Look at examples of good and bad management. How have people been inspired in the past

'1','1922','Support this but we are getting close to having a decision log being the only thing Gold would be doing
'1','1913','There is a danger of not listening enough to each answer while composing your nest comment. However I feel the benefits of he exercise outweigh the risks.'
'1','1917','This needs to be an active not passive role. Are ACCs sufficiently trained &amp; experienced to to do this effectively'
'1','1909','This is a job for a senior and experient police officer
'1','1911','Ownership of the investigation
'1','1908','lack of commitment to deliver a good service to individuals and communities.<br />not recognising and understanding difference'
'1','1929','Senior officers need training or issues to consider when dealing with multi cultural families'
'1','1921','Which gender is that?'
'1','1915','Cultural change must be led by the top team'
'1','1916','The police needs to adopt a strategy of &quot;co-operation by confrontation&quot;. That&#039;s the only way to avoid taking the blame for the absence / failure of other agencies and local government.'
'1','1919','Yes-I think this is the case and consequently institutionally racist'
'1','1908','an awareness that the buck stops at the top'
'1','1920','to genuinely seek their views and listen to community concerns<br />to allocate geographical based officers to various wards within snford'
'1','1911','Family not seen as important'
'1','1908','that strategy and tactics need to be linked. head in the strategy/feet in the tactics'
'1','1907','i have no doubt that the police could have done more to interact with the community and the varying groups within it - but this really is not just about the police
'1','1918','The lack of scnning systems to id race/hate crime issues means that no connectivity is identified and incidents are dealt with in stand alone fashion
'1','1921','a keyboard errer in typing?'
'1','1925','The Police response has a critical component;  to respect the family.  The primary role of the Police is to  investigate the cause of the tragic deaths
'1','1908','champions at all levels of the organisation.<br />a clear commitment from the top to walk the talk'
'1','1924','Isn&#039;t there an issue about taking an appropriate level of responsibility - but not allowing others to dump all the accountability at the police&#039;s door.'
'1','1908','to make decisions and be accountable for them'
'1','1933','the leadership appears not to recognise the scale of what happened in Sandford
'1','1922','I do not think that there was any evidence for this assertion'
'1','1913','All potential ACCs need to conside ow best to involve the Police Authority in organisationally threatening events  as represented by the weekend exercise. They have not been talked about a great deal.'
'1','1926','The service still has not acheived cultural change - I would question the real commitment of managers to it'
'1','1908','be careful about using the gold/silver/bronze system. It is not readily transferable out of the public order arena'
'1','1916','Look at the make-up of IAG'
'1','1917','Once a Critical Incident is declared ACCs have a resonsibility to consider the suitability of the SIO. Is this a &#039;tick&#039; in a box or a real consideration.  What effect on morale of removal of a SIO'
'1','1923','why are all the comments under this question about arrests rather than about institutional racism?  Looks like avoidance of the issue - instituational racim is alive and kicking and this needs to be acknoweldged and more importantly understood - eg the lawyer yesterday made the classic mistake of equating institutional racism with the racism of individuals'
'1','1913','Unfortunately that is how inquiries go.'
'1','1929','What was the strategic intelligence on linking these issues for presentation to divisional operations'
'1','1918','Does the emotional response by officers when meeting family members ensure that we are seen as unresponsive and out of touch? ie as we weigh every word before speaking it to ensure we cause no offence.'
'1','1911','labelling the force in this way may prevent action due to the magnitude of the changes required'
'1','1907','it may not be perfect
'1','1922','accept that but in a real one you should know the history'
'1','1908','good introduction by ken. shows good emotional intelligence and responsibility'
'1','1916','Lack of effective co-operation with other responsible agencies and local government'
'1','1913','If witnesses offer personal responsibility they need to understand th potential consequences. The facts of the events hardly matter.'
'1','1906','The importance of clear and unambiguous decision logs.'
'1','1926','How do you deal with the internal implications of an admission of racism. Do staff and the wider community understand the institutionalised racism'
'1','1923','i think it works - the problem seems to come when you have multiple silvers which muddies the waters between strategy and tatics/implementation potentialy confuses the role of Gold as wellas encouraging silo working at the delivery end'
'1','1911','Apologising repeatedly does not get over the fact that the force failed - you can apologise too much.'
'1','1925','Ken&#039;s introduction set the parameters and his opening statement took control of the meeting
'1','1924','A valuable step by Ken - to pre-empt this question and answer it before it gets asked'
'1','1912','Strong opening statement model of leadership by Ken of apologies
'1','1916','Based on my own experiences
'1','1923','why do we have so much trouble acknowledging institutional racism?  we still need to get over this initial barrier to adressing what we then do about it'
'1','1935','The majority of the wider community and roots level of staff would not appreciate the difference between racism and institutionalised racism. Hence why many colleagues may have felt sold short by senior officers in admitting to being institutionally racist.'
'1','1922','Good apology to family and community'
'1','1918','Not sure that the failings were institutionally racist
'1','1924','... But arrests wer made for this. And for the BIP demo. The lack of arrests is surely referring to the fire. And we never established that the fire was a crime
'1','1926','the drive to make early arrests where there is no evidence just because of community/media pressure lacks integrity. Arrests should occur at the earliest possibility but we must do so lawfully'
'1','1907','Ken gave a good response to the opening salvo from the panel. His acceptance of what standards should have prevailed was well said and thought out.'
'1','1911','Institutionally racist is a term we use within the service sometimes without knowing the true meaning or its implications.  Could it be perceived as glib use of complex language to deflect from individual failures'
'1','1906','We should not use arrests as the measure of success.'

'1','1918','What do the officers consider in relation to this implicit criticism when they have been injured etc when doing ther job
'1','1908','how visible was the acc to staff on the front-line during the time these incidents were happening. What support was being offered to staff during this difficult time?'
'2','0','Ron Cuthberson'
'1','1934','More linkage of preceding events and a beter response to them and better consequence management could have prevented the situation deteriorating as it did'
'1','1912','Structured response from Sapphire
'1','1929','There is no common platform which provides critical incidents with a check of what needs to be done in a uniform manner.  To undertake what needs to be done was from experience rather than a structured approach'
'1','1933','admission that police were slow to pick up the tensions
'1','1906','There is no incentive for partner agencies to contribute to the intelligence picture.'
'1','1915','The community has a perception of the quality of service it is receiving. Staff must be made aware that the way that they treat members of the community impacts on that perception. This fact should not affect the morale of staff as it is a truism'
'1','1924','The answer needs to be converting strategy into something practical that makes a difference'
'1','1911','Community impact assessment needs to be linked to the on-going evaluation of community feeling/sensing.  Routine activity we could have picked up the signals earlier'
'1','1907','The use of multiple silvers is more about a lack of understanding of the system. there should ideally only ever be one silver
'1','1922','how much can gold assume when setting strategy
'1','1908','What intelligence was available to assess what policing presence was needed at the vigil. What contingency planning had been put into place to police the vigil? If the policing had been at an appropriate level the riot would not have happened.'
'1','1918','Agree that systems and processes inhibit our officers from being fully aware
'1','1911','could we have better located the vigil and protected the participants better'
'1','1922','systems and processes have been driven by public enquiry and scrutiny'
'1','1931','Think this is fundamentally because we don&#039;t face into the emotional response people have to change.  Current change planning is a classic case in point - as far as I can tell the whole subject is being avoided - there isn&#039;t even an admission that there might be an emotional response that requires management. If we can&#039;t grasp this basic point at that level
'1','1907','....and it cost nothing'
'1','1926','We are meant to be leaders - it needs an author with morale courage on the basis ofshared experience'
'1','1908','What does this meAN?'
'1','1916','No intelligence led policing'
'1','1922','Good avoidance on the five mistakes question
'1','1907','But will it &#039;cost&#039; more in the long run???'
'1','1911','apology does not always equate to liability -'
'1','1932','to get grip'
'1','1923','we do not as far as I know do the research to establish the truth or otherwise of this assertion - has anyone for example analysed recordings from call centres to establish whether there is any identifiable difference in the response to peoplewith different levels of english/different accents?'
'1','1924','slow response
'1','1924','Ken&#039;s right to highlight some positives'
'1','1915','Excellent answer by Ken acknowledging opportunities to improve but balancing these with some good work done by the force'
'1','1926','Good answer re PPA - need to manage morale and internal relationships'
'1','1935','Surely the law is an incentive - partnership as expressed in the Crime and Disorder Act?<br />Part of the problem is that other agencies are not held to account in this as the police service.'
'1','1918','1. Failure of Community Tension analysis at any level.<br />2. No Hate/Race Policy apparent.<br />3 No Repeat Victim policy.<br />4 No link to incident history from same address etc.<br />5 No multi agency meeting to put all race/hate incidents into joint actioning.<br />The result was a total superficiality in managin any incident reported to police at Sandford.'
'1','1921','we ALL need better cAsE control'
'1','1908','That the organisation needs to  be much more diverse and include people who can relate to all communities. Not only is the police authority mainly white men but so is the service'
'1','1912','Goes with the territory
'1','1933','poor police response to a series of incidents can be seen to have generated the riot but the ACC does not seem to recognise this'
'1','1923','the most significant mistakes happened before the fire and are policy/leadership failures in not ensuring that WPS were engaged with the community and effectively identifying/acting on significant issues eg rise in racist incidents
'1','1906','The support of the family is crucial to the wider community perception of the police response.'
'1','1929','Turnover in police forces is about 10% per year and recruitment of police officers is from communities
'1','1916','Invest in community relationships in times of &quot;peace&quot;.'
'1','1911','Ken has put the family at the heart of the investigation - the language he has used will reassure'
'1','1918','Response by Ken is caring and sensitive in style and seeks to explore his decision making and rationale
'1','1925','Ken is using very positive language which is constructive
'1','1919','I think the FLO element could have been spelt out more broadly with action points'
'1','1923','this comment sounds like institutional racism is equated with individual racism - which is not the case'
'1','1921','What does this mean?'
'1','1919','Not sure that I understood some of the answers that came back'
'1','1923','they have been sold short - but by the failure of too many senior officers to understand institutional racism
'1','1911','Building the relationships before the critical incident happens'
'1','1916','So... what did we do to influence this?'
'1','1921','Okay.'
'1','1924','Some ACCs in my experience haven&#039;t got a clue. And you don&#039;t need to have necessarily been an SIO yourself to understand the ACPO role - but you do need to get out to Major Incident Rooms and develop an understanding'
'1','1926','Good to be able to operationalise the critical incident definition'
'1','1911','There is a desire to do this - untapped potential in thias area'
'1','1918','The response by Ken is considered and relective and his explanation of Steeples was logical and attempted to contextualise how difficult decision making was made using a structured model.'
'1','1906','The vulnerabilities of the situation require constant review at each decision.  It would benefit from the use of the 3PLEM model.  Steeples is an inapproriate framework.'
'1','1921','Have you read the Stephen Lawrence inquiry? Failure to make early arrests without any media pressure at that stage.'
'1','1922','Steeples model ensures consistency of approach
'1','1929','We have 43 different ways of dealing with call handling as we do of many other processes in the UK.  We need to have a national platform of standards for managing call handling etc to provide a UK excellence model for policing'
'1','1935','Officers on the ground do not appreciate being bombarded by computer based taining packages designed to &#039;train&#039; them in these complex issues - everyone inlcuding the public must be prepared to accept that it will take a long time and more than a few quick training courses to change attitudes.'
'1','1924','I don&#039;t think this is a fair comment. Both groups placed a high value on family liaison'
'1','1907','1. No real sense of who was in charge
'1','1921','That&#039;s why its a strategic command.'
'1','1908','Please explain 3PLEM'
'1','1926','How do you define success and failure - should we define it or should the community'
'1','1921','Semantics?'
'1','1916','Why is this 3PLEM model a better one?'
'1','1911','It appears that the police only believe its important after there has been a death - not regarded as high risk/importance until then'
'1','1906','Exert control.'
'1','1934','Both did verbally and particularly after the family meeting but there are no strategic and or tactical decisions around these issues documented'
'1','1906','Take ownership when things go wrong.'
'1','1931','Agreed and it starts with a visible demonstration of changed behaviours at ACPO level.  We will need to be brave.'
'1','1907','I suspect the issue will be like painting the Forth Bridge
'1','1918','This answer reflected acceptance of the failures of Sandford Police leadrs
'1','1919','Considering the reality
'1','1908','Well done Ken. You demonstrated personal responsibility and resiliance!!!'
'1','1909','Agreed
'1','1907','Corporate manslaughter????? If this is a serious connection
'1','1911','Death should not be the factor which initiates a police reaction and exploration of a set of incidents.  Risk assessment needs to be more sensitive and action oreintated - i.e. the risk assessment process is a means to prioritising actions and not justifying inaction.'
'1','1922','we talk alot about this but do we understand what it means.  Do we know what the culture is?  There are some really good things about &#039;police culture that we should not be changing.'
'1','1929','If there is continual scrutiny then it is only correct to continually endorse the empathy of apology'
'1','1908','Leaders responsibility to address the training
'1','1911','How did we use intelligence to guide our actions?  Few links to NIM have been seen throughout the incident.'
'1','1908','Was it declared as a riot or is that a use of the term in a non legal sense'
'1','1906','No actionable community inteligence.'
'1','1922','no it will save in the long run'
'1','1933','ACC has indicated that all the necessary systems were in place; the role of a leader is to ensure the systems are meaningful by providing the vision of how and why they are to be used; to give the people of Sandford an excellent service'
'1','1911','Cost to whom?'
'1','1918','I suppose  we each need to know what we are responsible for 
'1','1907','By making an &#039;apology&#039; the possible links to a later payout for some people may be raised?'
'1','1921','Local authorities are.'
'1','1922','Issues should not be linked
'1','1935','Absolutely agreed. This should not be conveniently forgotten in times of a shortage of officers.'
'1','1922','Become a learning organisation'
'1','1918','Took the moral high ground'
'1','1911','This is more useful than labelling as institutionally racist.'
'1','1909','I am going to take my learning back home (International) and mix it with our best practices.  It will take me 10 days to recover so its a case of internalising  &amp; processing it.  In the 10 weeks

'1','2049','deadly'
'1','2033','This was a very difficult area to control. It is my understanding that the relatives of deceased persons were naturally prioritised. Those persons severely injured were not automatically allocated FLO&#039;s and initially this caused some family distress.

'1','2067','The police authority composition is a matter for the governance arrangements for the local area etc. I/we cannot comment on this
'1','2069','Is the uncertainty with the community impact assesment symptomatic of a failure to take the requirements of the Race Relations Act'
'1','2058','there were arrests and 3 persons charge with incident one the attack upon the taxi driver'
'1','2059','Yes we accepted there were racial overtones in some of the pre cursor events lading upto the vigil. An appropraite response was put in place to police the vigil
'1','2073','You clearly did not enagage a member of the community in that cukture to advise.  Why not?'
'1','2068','how will you determine whether this learning has changed attitudeand culture within the organisation'
'1','2061','What has your learning told you about the contribution that BME staff casn make to your performance in this area?'
'1','2067','There are valuable lessons to be learned from this set of incidents and is it your intention to take the issues foward? What level and character of training do you envisage?'
'1','2070','How did you demonstrate grip'
'1','2089','Surely you cannot provide a whole answer to this
'1','2077','Maybe the community should have some say in whether this has made any difference?'
'1','2057','Carry out effective research into the B I P'
'1','2059','the possibility of public order was considered
'1','2071','lack of police response - graded response policy being reviewed<br />lack of customer care from control room operator - training analysis being undertaken<br />too little community intelligence at the outset to form an accurate tension indicator'
'1','2067','Visible leadership is essential to the delivery of any solutions to an issue or problem.  As senior officers we are all trained to recognise and deliver the appropriate structures and action to command and control such incidents.'
'1','2072','this calls for real soulsearching for each and every officer supported by the force in delivering informaion and training to our staff'
'1','2059','If you look at our policy log you will see our clear consideration of this issue and the need to support communication between the police and family by an individual with appropriate knowledge of both cultures'
'1','2069','What exactly were the risks of this incident and what does the document say'
'1','2070','Established by statute - depends on view of representation versus delegated
'1','2058','the remaks of the detective where his remarks and not those of the police service. It is apparent that the timing of the speach is evidence of the mischievous behaviour of that individual and it should be seen as remarks being made by someone who had clearly come to the end of their time'
'1','2068','surely you were aware of these views of the Det C. Supt.  Has he been challenged in the past.'
'1','2089','No - we need more representation here not just of people from BME communitiesbut also those who are active and can support progress.'
'1','2070','debrief feeding that into policies and training'
'1','2059','Because the have suffered a tragedy with the loss of two young children. That is not to say that their death was the responsibility of the police.'
'1','2069','Where is the document'
'1','2072','how do we check our intel on the make up of our community on a regular basis'
'1','2089','They can make a huge difference but must not be used just to deal with BME issues
'1','2067','The family may feel let down.  This incident was not necessarly a crime and could have been a tragic accident. We endeavoured to make good judgements based upon the individuals and the unique circumstances of their plight. We had to keep an open mind as to the outcomes but recognised that we had not even made a positive ID.'
'1','2059','These are the comments of one retiring officer not my views nor the views of the force. I find the comments made by the officer personally offensive'
'1','2067','What is the stength and reactive capability of the local CDRP? Can it reflect positively on these issues?'
'1','2057','A problem occurred because the family did not directly meet the Senior Investigating officer into the fire incident
'1','2067','This is not the case. We gathered together all interested and influencial parties. We reminded all about our service delivery intentions.'
'1','2068','Have you instigated a structured de brief around the police response to the situation.  How was this de brief managed and what has happened to the outcomes.'
'1','2059','There was no intelligence to make the bomb threat a serious issue. And there is a misconception that the death of the children was as a result of a firebombing!!! this is not the case
'1','2077','This support should continue as long as is necessary and is usually determined by the SIO.'
'1','2059','we have apologised for certain issues but not the whole'
'1','2058','attendance at a public meeting with a view to answerr questions and address public confidence in the police'
'1','2068','How effective has the Police respponse been to BIP.  How hAS THIS ORGANISATION BEEN ALLOWED TO SETTLE AND DEVELOP IN Sandford.  What has been the ongoing response by Special Branch.  Have security services been involved.  Do you know the leadership  etc etc.'
'1','2059','Yes and that will continue for as long as is necessary'
'1','2072','the police service/ criminal justice / partner agencies are not sophisticated in their preparation for community/ family support their is no central point of contact for cultural breifings / on line translated documents etc'
'1','2067','The issues regarding the retired senior detective as totally unacceptable and are subject to an enquiry. Any arrest are subject to the requirements of evidence and liasion with the CPS. We will pursue what evidence we can and are inviting people to come forward to assist. These are serios issues but we can only work with the co - operation of the public.'
'1','2075','What ever we did or did not do will not bring the children back. The parents are completely devestated by the loss but our actions or  lack of actions did not in any way lead to the childrens deaths.'
'1','2077','It is not always practical to meet with the SIO. Bearing in mind the meeting was impromptu
'1','2057','Set up an intelligence cell to collate all intelligence'
'1','2059','Community intelligence will improve if we learn and change'
'1','2067','The apology was on a persoanl level and not to any suggestion of collective failure. This was a gesture of common humanity.'
'1','2061','Was it a failure of risk assessment or a failure of leadership?'
'1','2070','egaged protocols with Loca Autority.  Slso established multi agency gold group.  Acknowdged and took account of impact on business.  Not only used these to gain understnading of local community but also to understand responsiblity of other agencies'
'1','2058','by ensuring that all partnership are engage with the community issues
'1','2089','There may be no evidence
'1','2067','How strong is the CDRP? Is it a talking shop or capable of real acion and intenrvention? What is the relatiuonship of the Diviisonal and the local CE under the C and DA?'
'1','2069','It seemed to take a long time to contact the family in Turkey. Wasn&#039;t this considered to be a priority and is this an example of institutional racism.'
'1','2067','That is beyond my control and is a atter for elected decison makers.'
'1','2057','A profile of the BIP was requested at an early stage'
'1','2059','This is an issue for the community as a whole and all our partners not just a police issue.'
'1','2083','did you learn anything from this meeting?<br />did you use what you learnt to revise your vigil risk assessment?'
'1','2067','No we are a pro -active organsation able to develop and reflect on our training and disposition. We will develop from this incident.'
'1','2068','what efforts have been made to identify whether these views of the Head of crime have resinence within ares of his responsibility'
'1','2061','How do you assess the effectiveness of your leadership?'
'1','2083','how have you missed the imam&#039;s warning of violence?  is his risk assessment less valid than yours?'
'1','2072','our training has to make a diffenece not to cover backsides or blame junior ranks the victim / community hasd to be the fucus'
'1','2071','At the time of the riot there was little evidence of the community tension over a period of time being evident'
'1','2067','Were the wider issues subject to abrogation of leadership and structure?'
'1','2067','No we are not institutionally racist.'
'1','2075','What do you mean by the &quot;incident&quot;. If the question is the public disorder then the main lesson learned is about getting community intellligence?information about the intent of the BIP'
'1','2059','There is a need for the police to provide timely and accurate information. we took steps to minimise the impact of misleading information at the public meeting.'
'1','2077','Need a broad base of community contacts within a range of faith groups to understand the issues and bring forward to the police. We need to make sure there are recognised routes for information.'
'1','2057','If it is not representative it is a matter for government to ensure that it is representative'
'1','2061','So how did you do it?'
'1','2067','Collectively we need to analyse the incidents'
'1','2070','This might be the case but given the history of immigration in this country how long will it be until we do get the necessary sophistication????'
'1','2072','is the police authority  proceess sufficiently supported to be an informed and effective body to police the police'
'1','2059','To the family for  their loss to the wider community for shortcomings where we have identified them'
'1','2058','it was neither
'1','2073','Potentially that we do not care/racist/different service to white people'
'1','2067','Was it both?'
'1','2081','a key component of leadership is surely the ability to acknowledge shortcomings when they occur'
'1','2091','When was the decision to make apologies made
'1','2073','Review of incidents with a view to identify learning and better practise.'
'1','2077','This applies to all public authorities.'
'1','2067','Make arrests for what? Not certaina this stage whether the fire is a crime or not?'
'1','2091','Where did you record the shortcomings for which you were making the apologies?'
'1','2069','Consider market research to be commissioned to discover true nature of learning process.'
'1','2067','What is the &pound;&pound;&pound;&pound; position of the authority under the Riot Damages Act????'
'1','2059','The fire is not being treated as a crime the cause of the fire although not known for certain
'1','2057','There was insufficient weight given to the vigil and the local intentions of the B I P'
'1','2091','Not sure what that means.  Were you personally sorry
'1','2059','The document is available and is clear as regards the intellignce available at that time'
'1','2057','I think it was both'
'1','2058','should the police authority be sellected by the local authority or elected directly to the authority?'
'1','2059','Not at all we are prepared to accept our shortcomings where we have found them and our policy logs support that theme as does the evidence we have given today'
'1','2077','I think we need to look at new ways of finding out about community tension. Do we have good intellugence links? How do we build these links to make sure we receive and share timely information with our local communities?'
'1','2058','should all elections be on porpotional representation so that each vote is of equal value?'
'1','2071','Whilst initial training is given
'1','2067','There will be a training intervention.  OK but when will it be completed and tested?'
'1','2072','how do we prepare for such multi agency crit incident working other than produciing policy'
'1','2059','there has been no blame of junior ranks
'1','2075','Arrests were made. The force along with other institutions MAY be institutionally racist. I do not hovever believe that the totally unacceptale comments of a retired officer is evidence of institutional racism. I also do not accept that our treatment of the family was racist.'
'1','2057','There is a large financial implication in translator services both with the spoken &amp; written word'
'1','2067','The organisational integrity is at riskj. What reasurrances can be given to immediate service delivery??'
'1','2059','all our training needs are constantly evaluated as a result of learning. We continue to review and test performance in those areas'
'1','2059','This is not an issue for the police'
'1','2077','I think we needed to know more about this local branch of the BIP. What has attracted a rally of 600 people to the area? Does the fact that there are high deprivation levels
'1','2067','These 5 incidents will be subject of a review. How they are linked and how they could be linked on the evidence available will be analysed and any lessons learned.'
'1','2058','by undersatanding that incidents can esculate and by early intervention taking ownership and responsibility
'1','2072','this is a mutli national issue and may have mutli national not unilateral solutions . How many traslators do GCHQ and the military employ considering current deployments.'
'1','2067','How will you bring to &#039;heel&#039; and staff who do not &#039;tow the line&#039;?'
'1','2067','Are you going to review the issues with the local chief executive? (He is on the panel!!)'
'1','2073','Training
'1','2057','training is of real importance to the Police service especially into new issues. However the perception is that training is not high on the agenda of the force'
'1','2089','Should this not have been done after the linkages were made in the first six incidents reported?'
'1','2058','surely all issues that impact on our community are issues for the Police.Perhaps all sections of our communities should have proportional representation within all aspects of local and national government!!'
'1','2077','I think we can be stronger than mischievous! Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Had the officer still been a serving officer then there would have been a thorough misconduct enquiry.'
'1','2076','The Police response on the night of the disturbance could have been more robust when the potesters first arrived.'
'1','2072','what is the organizational memory of the service .how as he new div commander how do I know of previous decisions which I should be aware of and be able to review.'
'1','2089','Were any police officers present in terms of attending on a personal level?  Was this looked into?  Should this make a difference when investigating the incidents which rollercoasted out of control?'
'1','2069','If people were arrested unlawfully the confidence of the community would be undermined.'
'1','2083','where were the family getting their perceptions from - the force
'1','2059','Elections to the police authority are not an issue for the police nor should they be. We are charged with delivering a service without fear or favour'
'1','2067','The meeting was attrended only by the police? Why? The LA owned the property. Could the Fire and Rescus help with their attendance?'
'1','2077','Locally I would expect that they have a significant role to play here. They
'1','2073','The mistakes formed a series of events which themselves individuallymay not appear to be wholely significant. However
'1','2072','failing to plan is planning to fail so did our strategic assessment recognise the race issues and recommend strategic solutions 
'1','2057','How do you measure how effective this is? Do we just put it in place without any effective means to ensure it has been effectively delivered?'
'1','2058','there were a number of incidents that clearly showed community tensions
'1','2067','What about PS Simmons?? Panel to ask a question re this please??'
'1','2081','this reads like a threat - does the force have underpinning values and behaviours that provide a framework for learning and finding ways to do things better?'
'1','2069','Do you intend to increase the availability of crtical incident training to other more junior ranks in the Force and of course including the control room.'
'1','2077','My experience of joint agency public meeting is that there is a more united front presented and the demonstration that this is not only a Police responsibility
'1','2078','significant
'1','2073','A general apologise for the riot taking place to the community would be appropriate but yet not necessarily an admission of guilt.  Any Borough Commander/CC would clearly not wish a riot on their patch regardless of what intel did or did not say.'
'1','2067','Panel please ask:-  What about the current status of Miss Gaynor? Is it a personal failure?'
'1','2077','This is fine
'1','2075','A small body can never be totally represntative of a community. It is an ideal that needs to be striven for. Representation should always be kept under review.'
'1','2073','Yes it is.  Members are elected who represent the community.  They provide and independant and critical eye of police whilst complying with legisation.'
'1','2067','I am taking all issues forward. We have to react in the immediate term but leadership requires I address all further issues
'1','2091','Actually events leading up to the vigil DO give the violence an air of predictability.  The Rally some days previously and the appearance and ejection of a member of the right-wing organisation the BIP from the public meeting.  This was something that should have appeared on your radar as &quot;reasonably foreseeable&quot; and provided for an effective response placed on standby ina discreet by appropriate distance from the vigil.'
'1','2067','The vigil disturbances are regretted and shows the absolute determination for many in this community to wreck the high standards we all aspire to.'
'1','2073','The role of the leader is to lead-make both fast time and slow time decisions based on a rational and documented process
'1','2077','There were agreements made with the family to make whatever contact was needed to make sure family in Turkey were sensitively briefed on the circumstances of the tragic deaths. There was no delay. Where is the institutional racism here?'
'1','2072','for sapphire we can see a change and develpoment of our recording processes and team maagement from day 1 to 2   but I amnot confident we would have the leadership when faced with a sin=milar incident and no clear management structure'
'1','2061','Are you satisfied that you have an effective proffessional standards regime?'
'1','2057','This is of vital importance. The initial action/inaction is paramount and a bad decision or no decision to deal with an incident may never be recoverable.  It is vital that Control operaters are trained to recognise major/critical incidents and to insigate the correct response.'
'1','2077','Does it matter?'
'1','2067','ON what level is the apolgoy being given? Personal? Private? Collective failure? Admitting total fault?'
'1','2089','What else was done to respond to the other six incidents?  Were they ever resolved?  All of these still needed investigating and he families supported to deal with their issues?'
'1','2069','Private apology to the family but also prepared to give fulsome public apology which was meant to  be given at time of public apology'
'1','2075','How can we ever be that certain or sure - we reflect society.'
'1','2091','Do you consider that four hours was a reasonable time for a readily-prepared standby force of trained public disorder specialist police officers to bring a total of 60 rioters under control?  Or is it a symptom of inadequate preparation
'1','2083','prioritising police reputation over community protection'
'1','2071','The decision to apologise was made prior to the public meeting. This decison was not recorded. But unfortunately due to a bomb scare at the meeting the opportunity was lost. Lessons learnt to deliver such messages at the earliest opportunity.'
'1','2089','Is staff training in need of a serious review - in terms of police resonse and the delivery of service amongst the whole of Sandford Police Force?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
'1','2072','did we make efective use of intelligence processes and resources as a force in recognition of the escalation of incidents'
'1','2058','it was clear from the meeting that there was some public disquiet about the policing response to the tragic fire.As such this reinforced that the operational plan  needed to be sympthetic and not heavy handed but with the capasity to respond positively and effectively to any esculation.'
'1','2067','Is it? How are the authority being advised themselves?'
'1','2083','if a vicar rang warning of violent disorder would you take note?  would you meet with him / her to talk about his concerns asap?'
'1','2068','the Organisation&#039;s response to the Race Relations Amendment Act  has been widely commended.  All our policies have been reviewd
'1','2089','This is a very confident remark and I can only hope that this can one day be true!  It&#039;s time to be honest instead of simply being defensive all of the time.  Should we not be working together to eradicate racist staff by acknowledging the problem instead of hoping it will go away?'
'1','2083','what difference does it make how much all this ened up costing.  two kids are dead well before the riot.  what price on their lives?'
'1','2058','Community Intelligence was available
'1','2067','Arrest or real probability of conviction?'
'1','2083','how often do you refresh it?'
'1','2073','My leadership has reassured both the police and community.'
'1','2075','We should take note of all community intelligence.'
'1','2058','are the police not part of the community and does that not allow them a say'
'1','2081','the comparison between sapphire and emerald logs showed the values of the systems approach (by sapphiree) as against the bullet list (by emerald)'
'1','2070','what on earth did I apologise for??  Should have prepared a specific response - thought it was clear in my mind but  CRAFT!!!'
'1','2069','Ensure staff associations are also involved in process.'
'1','2076','But not beyond influence'
'1','2083','are the political parties represented on the authority representative of the community - does this creat an inbuilt imbalance?  should you act affirmatively correct this?'
'1','2057','effective horizon scanning may have made an early idetification of the BIP problem'
'1','2077','Similiarly our Inspectors are our Bronze Commanders
'1','2089','Are there the resources for continual support?'
'1','2091','Perhaps the question should read &quot;How will you identify and then deal with those people who disregard the training and continue in their old ways?&quot;'
'1','2083','do you have a sense that the police are the primary organisation in any (partnership) situation?'
'1','2084','and to identify them early and react to them to prevent reoccurance'
'1','2058','how do we then promote diversity is the small bodies are ignored?'
'1','2076','World Politics shows that proportional representation only leads to stagnation and centre ground politics'
'1','2073','Consider reassurance and support by introducing personally traiming programmes.'
'1','2083','where was your sense of customer focus?'
'1','2059','The apology was for their loss and yes I was personally sorry'
'1','2083','do you personally really care?'
'1','2059','Yes'
'1','2083','are you racist yourself?'
'1','2075','How are really small minorities represented'
'1','2076','I think the evidence on this occasion is that the force is institutionaly racist'
'1','2083','can you follow leaders who do not have pips?'
'1','2073','The situation became beyond my control following the arrival of actvists.'
'1','2069','Which family - the family responsible for the deaths or the actual parents'
'1','2070','what is the community intelligence gathering process and how does that feed into the NIM and our t and C process'
'1','2089','How many of these are told to the community to help increase public trust and confidence - to show them that you do not tolerate any form of racism within the force?'
'1','2083','is there deep leadership in your organisation?'
'1','2091','If there was sufficient weight given to the activities and threats to the community of the BIP (who had a local meeting place and were able to attract six hundred to the rally)
'1','2081','you need to look again at the definition - &#039;seen or detected in processes attitudes and behaviour&#039;'

Good job done by the speaker.'
'1','2113','countries must cooperate with others inorder to collect ideas and information to achieve results. If a problem stay in a particular country it is very difficult to be investigated. Terrorism is an international sort of crime that requires international cooperation'

'1','2107','Undoubtedly

Vehicles  were being set ablaze just a few streets from the station.'

'1','2167','Ownership of  incidents reported by the public to the Police via 999 system and other methods during the Saturday and Sunday was lost in not having an effective linkedcommand structure for both incidents of disorder and usual business calls.'
'1','2159','The brief stated that no &#039;organiser&#039; had come forward and therefore Section 14 PO Act orders were not applicable. It seemed later in the day that everyone knew who was &#039;incharge&#039; the route and anticipated numbers. More advanced planning could have kept us in control'

'1','2182','This event hi-lighted the fact that Key Individual Networks across the Force Area are not fit for purpose and comprise

'1','2172','The gold group meeting included partner agencies for much of the time. This was very useful. However
'1','2181','In hindsight it was the worst location to have it - considerable resources had to be deployed to secure senior police officers and it became a site of disorder.'
'1','2165','It seemed strange to me that a DSO was required to deploy Batons Guns in public Order situations but not a Firearms deployment. Why do we need a DSO. It wastes time waiting for them to deploy and is another Command level to deal with. Would they really overrule a Bronze asking for the assistance of Baton guns/Firearms.'
'1','2171','On the Saturday night it appeared that no consideration was given to implementing an exclusion zone around the localised are of disorder in Handswoth and Lozells. Many innocent motorists were entering the area and being attacked by those involved in the disorder.'
'1','2159','decision to keep level one trained staff on standby for so long. It was not until they were deployed that the violence was quelled and youths dispersed. Could earlier deployment have had same effect?'
'1','2169','there was no link into gold for he intelligence for example the commander would find out at the 5pm meeting that a demo was planned but this was too late for gold controls/ coordinators who were not informed and were being questioned by acc&#039;s and above as for the resourcing implications required for the demo'

'1','2181','The change over from &quot;event&quot; Silver to &quot;disorder&quot; silver was prolonged.'
'1','2155','Did Gold know the true picture of what was happening during the critical period of disorder.  Silver had no resources to use when AO was tracking a group &#039;looting&#039; and Gold still refused to utilise the Gold Reserve.'
'1','2180','Gold and silver were underresourced-people worked too long.'
'1','2175','The F3 bought everyone a MacDonalds and that was much appreciated!'

'1','2183','I dont believe we actually understand what we mean by community intelligence? It requires defining. It is community information until such time it has been evaluated and provenanced'
'1','2159','Common standards of post incident appreciation/recognition. Some OCU&#039;s have already awarded staff with bonus payments whilst others have gone unrecognised. No consistency across Force.'
'1','2177','The change from functional to territorial bronzes was not well planned for.'
'1','2167','The initial electronic debriefing was available for two days immediately after the conclusion of Javari at which point
'1','2176','The pressure on local staff (D1/F3) was PHENOMENOL. They had to stand by while others made operational decisions that would affect their local policing relationships for years to come. It is right to have outside silvers
'1','2160','There was an apparent breakdown in he quality and quantity of intelligence that was available and how it was being fed into the operation.  At one point we were presented with a list of some 70 to 80 vehicle registrations

'1','2159','Use of AO1... officers changed to ground to air channel but this effectively became self deployments outside of Bronze control.'
'1','2154','lack of spare protected vans
'1','2181','Silver&#039;s capacity as the single point of decision making during disorder is questionable.'
'1','2177','We must get away from the &#039;usual suspects&#039; doing all the command roles for firearms
'1','2180','This is a good point. We need to work out how we feed intell into Gold and Silver without causing confusion or delaying decision making. This needs some work'
'1','2169','officers to ensure next of kin details on the oasis system are upto date this was a huge problem when officers were injuried'
'1','2182','The different Bureaux within Force Intelligence combined to provide the first  Joint Intelligence Cell (JIC).

'1','2183','Gold control were being dynamically informed of critical intelligence the failure was to process manage that within gold with caller takers not having a structure with which to take the information to'
'1','2159','Excellent idea to utilise this facility wher an archaeic system would inevitably mean pats on the back and promotion when lessons could and should be learnt.'

'1','2177','I find it hard to se how we will ever use baton rounds. When the threat is from a mobile crowd armed with conventional firearms
'1','2154','force intel poor.....did not update the op enough'
'1','2180','IPCC support after the shooting was critical - that could have turned nasty for us if rumours had perssited that this was a police shooting.'
'1','2159','However no veggie option!'
'1','2165','The firearms capability was stretched in providing 24 hour cover to the disorder so that normal force firearms commitments were very limited'
'1','2169','a real problem was that on the weekend of the disorder the helicopter did not have a pilot until 3pm this was an importent tool that could not be used by lack of thought on the helicopter department'
'1','2154','fully agree'
'1','2167','Public Order Overalls were inappropriate for the length of time officers were deployed. Two piece suits are both more practical and comfortable'
'1','2170','I think they have a positive influence but probably a little too much'
'1','2173','Press office need to take a firmer control of press conferences. Employ a system of taking names of all those in attendance
'1','2172','I disagree. As soon as the officer had been shot
'1','2177','I disagree
'1','2167','Vehicles unable to carry numbers of staff and equipment necessary if a fully deployed PSU with medics EGT  and PSU commanders'
'1','2180','Good question and one that troubles me even now. At the time we needed to find a way to &quot;close&quot; the demo - Derek Webleys offer seemed like a sensible/sensitive way forward.'
'1','2161','In hindsight yes- better contingency planning
'1','2154','no it wasnt every one should have 2 piece suits...supplies unit should have addressed this x2 years ago when identified!'
'1','2171','On the saturday lunchtime there were major problems with Airwave and this left commanders and officers on the ground particularly outside the hairdressers feeling exposed. For over an hour communication was intermittent at best having to resort to the use of mobile phones and officers being used as `runners` on the ground. If this problem had occurred later in the day when there was real disorder many officers could have been exposed to lethal force without support from colleagues.'
'1','2175','It was considered and the first judgement call was to leave the station front office open. It was only members of csb who raised this issue
'1','2169','fit teams used at g8 were found to be over whelmed by the crowd in scotland things were not as violent and there were not the firearms fit teams at night in handsworth following the trashing of the public orde vans and the level of violence would not have been safe for the officers'
'1','2177','I suspect we focussed too much on the black community
'1','2154','no spare vehicles again!'
'1','2166','Until there is some central control over the shift patterns this force works
'1','2183','Why did silver need an intell cell along side them? The intelligence was flowing out of the SPOC and required people to make decisions. Not realistic to expect an intelligence officer to do that. There was evidence of a comfort blanket factor in having intell staff present in Silver. Utilised to photocopy and make tea. Best use of resources?'
'1','2173','Fully support this needs to be a priority!'
'1','2180','Council&#039;s response throughout has been disappointing-we cannot afford to be resigned to this situation
'1','2175','Yes I saw on CCTV a number of lucky escapes for motorists.'
'1','2181','This is the first major disorder we have had in the era of mobile phones - information overload was a critical issue due to numbers of calls.'
'1','2165','Neither were the FOU. We need to keep FOU/OSU trained up in these tactics but need the appropriate vehicles too. I believe that most future large scale disorder will involve criminal use of firearms and we have a duty to unarmed officers to be suitably trained and equipped to assist them'
'1','2157','PSUs kept o/s church on Lozells Rd &quot;guarding&quot; two vans that had been attacked and damaged.Kept there for hours when could have been deployed elsewhere.  Requests made to get vehicles moved remained unactioned'
'1','2172','Agreed. This needs some fast work and they need to be held to account. However
'1','2170','The Bronze Commander could have directed the staff to get hold of Silver or called Gold to resolve the issue'
'1','2167','The idea that only a certain percentage of the force should be trained resulted in the same officers being required to perform roles continually. Review training needs both in general public order training but also the specialist roles.'
'1','2161','Dnamic risk assessment at F3 was that it was unsafe to send unprotected OCU resources. A clear message not sent to Silver that response here was expected from resources under silver control. Consequently did Silver fully understand what was happening on the ground'
'1','2177','I suspect it precipitated something that was likely to happen. We knew early on saturday that there were asian shops closed and asian youths out on the streets. I suspect the die was cast by then.'
'1','2171','Totally agree and as a bronze i used this method to self depoly to Newbury Rd where disorder was taking place. prevented McDonalds being looted at Newtown shopping centre by a group of around 30-40 hostiles.'
'1','2180','We do need to rethink who is on our KIN&#039;s and what we share with them.'
'1','2170','And on occasions put themselves at risk'
'1','2166','ACPO Guide to Keeping the Peace determines the use of a DSO'
'1','2160','PSU supervisors should have told oficers to remove reflective jackets'
'1','2153','That is a good point that is continually pushed within the office and is being put into place where we can. I think the press officer dealing with the conference and the SIO have to agree clear boundaries beforehand so we both know when the point comes to stop the conference.'
'1','2181','As someone on the OSU  the ground in 1985 Lozells riots this went a whole lot better!'
'1','2173','Crime Support are attempting to put together a de-brief booklet for use on all critical incdents.  This has come from the &#039;Stanstead&#039; de-briefs

'1','2169','this has been an issue fr at least 3 years ocus are not taking this seriously as for normal saturday night van patrols this event highlighted the problem now lets address it'
'1','2177','In their defence they are trying to. The latest product on trial burns - that&#039;s no use either.'
'1','2172','Its time the force invested in video conferencing...which has been available for some years now..this would have prevented silver commander being at HQ and not in command of the incident.'
'1','2181','The Force is set up to deliver Sector Policing but is vulnerable at times of crisis.'
'1','2161','Organisational knowledge of applying trained tactics at a critical time. Tactical plan for creating a sterile area around the key seat of disorder in Lozells'
'1','2173','The quality of footage from AO1 is not particulary good was there a EGT deployed in the aircraft?'
'1','2167','There is a need for a cadre of specialist roles to maximise effectiveness and  experience with a training and shadowing policy to provide resilience.'
'1','2171','There were vehicles being burnt out in Radnor Rd less than five minutes walk from the station. maybe those in the front office were not as aware of what was actually taking place as those working within the intel function in the CSB.'
'1','2174','Agreed  -Gold need to stay in role &amp; not get involved in tactical decisions.  Continuity &amp; consistency of command will always be an issue in incidents that run over several days.'
'1','2154','i agree certain senior managers looked at jobs as rank specific not role specific....lot of experience not utilised'
'1','2177','Transport office had real problems getting vehicles from other forces
'1','2181','There were immediate attempts to get the Vans moved as there was with a dog van that broke down but it didn&#039;t happen.'
'1','2174','Force should agree a standard deployment that is approriate fto provide Bronze support (&amp; indeed Gold &amp; Silver support).'
'1','2161','No risk assessment of polce atending the church event.'
'1','2173','Fully supported the concept of a JIC worked'
'1','2183','The intelligence products that came to be relied upon by the strategic command were only as good as the response to the intelligence reqirement that was set. Intelligence that came from sensitive intelligence assets had significant impact on the strategy to reduce the threat from Urban Street gangs who were using the scenario as an opportunity to exploit and expand their theatre of operations'
'1','2170','The change from public meeting to public disorder was gradual - If we had moved from one to the other more quickly the police would have been blamed for inciting  the disorder by being heavy handed'
'1','2176','Many people worked very long hours indeed. I only hope that they would have been supported by the force if they made a mistake due to exhaustion!'
'1','2153','Force needs to invest in a comprehensive media monitoring service rather than relying on staff
'1','2159','This was done &#039;in house&#039; and was in depth and suitable with the correct people involved.'
'1','2182','Dedicated cell worked 24/7 and handled all intel relevant to event. Dynamic intel was fed to silvers immediately and intel summary docs provided twice daily for Gold meetings.'
'1','2177','Not fair. The only problem was gold commander getting sucked into brieifngs at height of disorder.'
'1','2169','we did not have a paris so we did well well done f3 management'
'1','2161','Yes- had a significant impact upon reducing scale
'1','2173','The IPCC present at the press conference was a good idea and worked well'
'1','2166','There are sufficient numbers trained

'1','2165','Thats true but with all the other new commitments such as Suicide Killers
'1','2170','Who knows - I think it was a sound decision at the time'
'1','2174','Should be an SOP for the Force in these situations.'
'1','2180','There was a delay in Gold being fully aware-not sure why this occurred. In every major Gold/silver I have worked this happens at key moments - fog of battle? - not a good explanation and uncomfortable to review but this does happen.'
'1','2167','Who is trained to conduct this type of risk assessment and which role  is best suited to carryout such a task????'

'1','2170','The numbers of trained officers in different disciplines should be considered across the force. and allocated to staff who are available. This was an issue due to the front line policing staff not being trained
'1','2166','It might be helpful to understand clearly the communication processes between Gold Silver and Bronze and to have back up communication systems.'
'1','2169','Composition of Gold group (the presence of non-Police participants) was not condusive to open discussion regarding sensitive issues.

'1','2186','Considering the staffing levels within out Press and Public Relations Department I think you did very well'
'1','2166','Agreed and staff should be volunteers who have been assessed as credible'
'1','2174','and having heli-telly working will mean that silver and gold can have a much better perspective on what is happening on the ground'

'1','2169','Pro-active strategic deployment of ANPR would add to the intelligence picture and assist the investigation process. Strategic points should be identified for dynamic ANPR deployment during the planning stages for any future Critical Incidents'
'1','2166','Yes - and do they test the right things - how about some Gold - Silver refershers?'
'1','2171','This is right. We need to hold a Gold &quot;Core Group&quot; where we can share everything and then bring in other key partners later.'
'1','2174','must avoind the &#039;usual suspects&#039; doing all the jobs - it resticts resilience and deskills those who are not part of the inner click of &#039;glory boys&#039;'
'1','2163','Yes agreed. -reality is that the rumour and identification that it waas a &#039;critical incident&#039; was only effectively known on the Tuesday before the disorder.'
'1','2178','Additional central support should be provided to an OCU planning team in large scale events such as this at the earliest opportunity. In this event too few staff were left planning the response too an event which had enormous potential to impact of the integrity of the force.'

'1','2174','It seems bizarre that out of office hours the most senior officers on duty are currently acting inspectors for much of the force. This was a planned event and by no means spontaneous - had it been the response would have been dire.'
'1','2183','while the force need to look after its staff there is a need for staff and supervisors to think for themselves. You know you are going to be in a van for hours so plan to have emergency rations in your bag
'1','2159','Inter Force aid - yes we are a big Force (and getting bigger) but it is not an admission of failure to request resources from elsewhere. We supplied to G8!'

'1','2186','All events of this nature should be owned by HQ Operations

'1','2177','There are over 2
'1','2172','Mobile Phones: if Airwave goes down so probably will mobile phones. Not suitable for public order deployment'
'1','2182','HQ ops could assist OCU planning teams in a consultancy role to advise around force/resourcing/planning issues....inc in HQ ops are OSU
'1','2178','Many F3 staff still feel threatened after the disorder. Force resources have left and returned to their own areas. Consideration should be given to the option for F3 staff to move around the force and for opportunities for staff from other OCU`s to taste the F3 experience. Op Strikeout provided good evidence that many officers fro across the force would like the opportunity to work in a demanding environment experienceing serious crime on a regular basis.'
'1','2186','Support would be useful but following the build up of community tension we should have had HQ Operations involved at a much earlier stage.'
'1','2182','review of airwave..does it work in the world of public order and fireams......we dont think they do!'
'1','2170','Quite often supervisors are asked to switch channels to monitor other situations however this impacts upon airwave and excessive use of a channel can cause it crash......or so we are lead to believe.'
'1','2166','The force has recently reviewed the structure and considered dedicated force out of hours supt cover for the force and decided not to proceed as I understand'
'1','2172','Review of Airwave system particularly handsets in wet weather which appeared to be very impactive on the quality and ability to communicate.'
'1','2183','good to see him in gold with the rest of the staff the times he went to briefing of officers could have been more this would have increased moral'
'1','2159','There needs to be a contingency plan that is mobilised by Silver but not dependent upon Silver having to prompt everything. Some sort of IT support for this would be appreciated.'
'1','2163','See previous comment about interference of F3 management in Force Strategic Plan. There is a lack of clarity here
'1','2155','I agree DSO adds an additional tier of command which would slow down decision making  &amp; our response.  A public order commander on scene should have the appropriate ACPO authority to deploy baton guns against lethal (non firearms) riot - the firearms threat is a separate issue
'1','2171','I am not sure it is about the numbers of trained officers so much as their availability. We need to build in and then enforce minimum resource levels at any given time for all key roles. This needs to be proportionate to the threat/risk'
'1','2165','Force Intelligence provided the intelligence flow and process is adhered to.'
'1','2159','I know that the leter he sent to an OSU Inspector and his staff thanking them for their work on the night was very  much greatly appreciated.'
'1','2177','I think it&#039;s reasonable to expect at least one meal to be provided within a 17 hour tour of duty'
'1','2182','please review the use of the Airwave system'
'1','2166','The incident was managed well.  In a situation like this there will always be opportunities for learning - we have some.'
'1','2170','Review of the levels of recognition that is not consistent across all OCU&#039;s for staff that were deployed to the same incident.'
'1','2171','In many forces the Chief may not have been around at all.'
'1','2171','Thank you for dinner last night'
'1','2153','Shouldn&#039;t it be obvious to Switchboard not to route them through to silver/gold. In future the press office will attempt to let Switchboard know our statements but when the likelihood is that there is one or two press officers in handling hundreds of media calls
'1','2159','As Silver the opportunity to speak to him in the early hours of Sunday was useful in order to convey what had happened and the good work that had been done by officers &amp; staff.'
'1','2170','It photocopied very well for 24 personal files!'
'1','2174','I think we have overcomplicated &#039;critical incident&#039; in this force which is why nobody uses it. ACPO needs to sign up to wanting to be a &#039;risk averse&#039; force - then drive forward the policy.'
'1','2166','The timimg of this de-brief was about right - sufficient time for people to reflect - it worked for me'
'1','2183','we managed the incident without the need for mutual aid. Other forces would not have been able o do this'
'1','2155','Insist on this debrief being followed up with vigour - pledge some resources to implementing the main recommedations that the Force develops from this process.'
'1','2180','WhAT DID YOU HAVE?'
'1','2182','Have your officers got the best possible public order equipment...No they havent'
'1','2162','Consider training the some of the OSU in Baton gun in public order tactics and may be AFO&#039;s thereby releasing a number of firearms officers required in disorders. They would then be available for core policing firearms roles and spin off investigations from the disorder.'
'1','2178','I would like to see the Chief Constable follow through on his commitment to review the force resilience in responding to such disorder. This debrief event is an excellent starter but I hope we act on the considered feedback ti improve things for the future.'
'1','2163','Overall Force dealt with incident remarkably well.  Always areas of learning
'1','2175','Overall the operation was a success and the force should be justifiably proud of that. However
'1','2153','His interest in media issues and press office welfare was welcomed.'
'1','2182','pie and chips and a can of coke in his car'
'1','2170','You head a force that abides the best traditions of &#039;getting the job done when the chips are down!&#039;.'
'1','2169','He provided strong leadership at Gold meetings but was absent from officer briefings and media events'
'1','2165','Intelligence is the treasure of the ruler.... it must be adequately resourced to deliver'
'1','2166','But what we have is pretty good'
'1','2155','Need more OSU (please Sir)'
'1','2159','Thats why they are reducing the number of Forces.'
'1','2178','If this is true then I must say there were many other staff involved over the weekend of disorder that should expect such recognition.'
'1','2174','Dont be too distracted by the strategic force discussions
'1','2171','I endorse views about Hydra as a debrief model. It has worked really effectively in allowing everyone a real say without some of the vulnerabilities that open and honest feedback can raise.'
'1','2172','With the exception of the DCC&#039;s effective briefing message
'1','2163','Resist temptation to jump in and lead the &#039;recovery plan&#039; within the community. This was not disorder about policing or authority and although a key stakeholder we should not lead the recovery. That is for others'
'1','2181','Overall Op Javari was a sucess and the majority of staff know this. However there are serious issues raised by this debrief that need to be addressed. Once resolved all staff need to know that things have been taken seriously and that maybe the same mistakes will not be made again.'
'1','2166','The press office did a very good job in supporting the force'
'1','2170','Operations Department is under rated and under resoursed. Every OCU benefits and for the sake of loosing minimal staff
'1','2159','That applies at all levels - senior colleagues may be in the invidious position of awarding themselves something - should be some central recognition.'
'1','2169','Rather than waiting until the next vent that we have to
'1','2183','there are many people who worked behind the scenes that would benifit from a word of thanks at the end of the year this has been a heavy year on the force with general elections g8 terroism
'1','2182','Your OSU are now to specialist..cbrn moe
'1','2158','CC and all senior management very supportive in allowing the post crime/disorder investigation to progress in a methodical manner without any pressure for quick results - much appreciated'
'1','2178','Please implement a tenure policy for OSU sgts'
'1','2159','The OSU in insufficient in size to effectively support the Force in the event of major disorder.'
'1','2180','tWO MANY OF YOUR SENIOR OFFICERS CARN&#039;T SPELL!'
'1','2153','Can the press office have some more press officers so they can effectively staff the office 24/7 for major incidents?'
'1','2174','Agreed again
'1','2165','We need to make sure that we know what we know in terms of information and intelligence and once we know what we know take the high ground'
'1','2167','The Chief made several visits to the refreshment area and ate the meal!!'
'1','2170','Too much emphasis on visibility. No one wanted hi vis jackets in disorder...but this was insisted upon. Corporate image has its place but maybe not during a riot.......it did look good on the telly.'
'1','2175','In the true sense of the role of gold
'1','2155','Structure  Gold so there is no doubt if asked the question about &#039;who is in charge of this incident?&#039;'
'1','2166','The Command Team did a good job - we all worked hard and there are lessons to be learned at every level'
'1','2171','Need to hold the Council to account now. If they see this as a one off public order issue and therefore a police matter
'1','2159','They should already be subject to management review.'
'1','2170','Set at 30 years!!!!'
'1','2174','bless'
'1','2173','The MIU were set up following a business case around murder investigation. The investigation of disorders on this scale takes this role into a new area.  The support from OCU&#039;s has been superb and we now need to look at how we would cope the next time.  I agree that the MIU should be involved from an early stage with guidance and support around EGT&#039;s and obtaining of exhibits'

'1','2303','So much of what we do is dependent upon the community having confidence in our ability and professionalism. If this is lost we struggle to deliver our service.

'1','2303','Balance is about trying to walk a path of accepting and respecting the needs of individuals and groups

'1','2302','Sometimes people are forgotten about both internally and externally when a critical incident has occurred.  Considerations such as litigation
'1','2296','I assume this relates to a more loose interpretation. ie sometimes to lose but learn in the process is a win?'
'1','2314','Organisations do not love - they just are.'
'1','2311','It is essential that from a very early stage we identify those involved and if they are a victim. This will assist in obtaining a win win and provide us with the basis for our strategy to deal with the incident'

'1','2314','Critical incidents by their very nature need to be dealt with speddily and effectively - money should not come into it.'
'1','2318','Sometimes maintaining the confidence in individuals or organisations is more important than on other occasions. The belief and confidence that the Justice system is fair is  and just is more important than the the confidence that there are no &#039;back handers; in Premiership Football for example.'
'1','2329','Treat each victim as you would the other. People will include everyone involved in the incident from staff to passers by.'
'1','2311','In all critical incidents we need to be aware of other organisations roles and powers i.e. IPCC'

'1','2302','Do we really learn from past incidents?  We conduct debriefs and then the valuable information gleaned tends to be forgotten because we move on and time is a great healer.'
'1','2300','Given that critical incidents are by definition &#039;important&#039; events in the lives of people and organisations it is fundamental that we do the right thing. Without integrity we have no respect and no lawful mandate. Integrity protects our intentions.'

'1','2310','it is at times of pressure that we all show clear commitment
'1','2292','Learning is often an objective but not supported by processes and resources to enable it to happen and measurements to evaluate the success of the learning.  All these need to be in place for the learning to truly stick.'

'1','2314','You are only here once - do something you enjoy or move on'
'1','2313','My view on this is not necessarily about the compensation issue but the tremendous drain on resources that occurs when such incidents reach the litigous stage.'
'1','2300','you get paid the same whether you are enjoying yourself or being miserable. Whilst you are at it
'1','2318','The organisation needs to allow people to learn but on occasion mistakes are of such importance that the need to punish or dismiss outweighs the need to leran for individuals but not for organisations'

'1','2301','it
'1','2309','should not be measured in terms of hours spent in the work environment'
'1','2329','You don&#039;t have to treat critical incidents as a &#039;panic button&#039; but take it stage by stage and you will enjoy the end result if you have applied all the principles of handling critical incidents'
'1','2310','to be a true learning organisation we must be in a position to challenge
'1','2324','is it punishment or is it putting right all the wrongs'
'1','2308','Respect also means respecting and listening the views of those within your organisation and the wider community who have expertise in dealing with different aspects of incident management. Rank does not always mean that you are right.'
'1','2302','What does this mean?  What are we trying to balance?'
'1','2300','General practice seems to dictate that we only learn from the error not the success. &#039;Learning&#039; has become an urban myth and we have perhaps forgotten what we mean by the word.'

In the weeks to this stage I would have looked at some of the issues raised from the exercise started to make some changes in the way that I would handle a critical incident.'
'1','2326','10 weeks - will no longer be part of the GMP family but before then will seek to add value to CC&#039;s vision and his plans to get a ticket to the party.

'1','2316','10 weeks<br />As I now run the force policy unit - I will consider if the appropiate guidance is appropiate for the task and whether it needs revising. As I am scoping the whole of force policy I will have to prioritise - however this day has certainly raised critical incident guidance up the list.<br />Linked to this issue is the role of Independent Advisory Groups - do we use them effectively or are they just another tick box - I may do some analysis in conjunction with diversity command. At present we are rationalising strategic groups are these just token groups - how do they affect performance'
'1','2299','Ten weeks:<br />Actively seek colleagues from different backgrounds than myself and have honest conversations whereby I could check my perception as to what their experience in this organisation has been like. The challenge would be in building the right relationship that enables honesty

'1','2325','over the next 10 days I will be continue to do my best in my role in support of all Police Staff in GMP and will possibly enter into discussions on the possible effect on Police Staff of the reduced budget and in the hope that it will not be a critical incident.'
'1','2312','3) I dentify and link causes to critical incidents(in my area of work) and circulate disseminate any learning to force.<br />4) Look at management information provided to force to identify what
'1','2315','10 weeks - Become actively involved in supporting the Diversity Command and not focusing on my own &#039;silo&#039;. Doing this in such a way that supports and does not interfere.'
'1','2324','10 WEEKS<br />Over the following 10 weeks I feel I would be more alert to the issues that I understand to fall under the label of diversity without having to make an effort to think about it.'
'1','2303','10 day<br />Review current operations for their impact binternally / externally - what is transferable from today?'
'1','2336','10 weeks - I would reflect on these issues and any personal issues or fears I might have in dealing with a critical incident and seek advice and share best practice from colleagues.'
'1','2301','10 months - To be in a position whereby we can tangibly measure some degree of success in the way we approach and deal with issues of race - we might do this by benchmarking where we are now and where we are in 10 months'

'1','2333','10 weeks - Discuss with staff
'1','2335','10 days - I will have met with members of the GMPA re a stop search information campaign we are taking to the public. This is already pre-set. I am now conscious that during previous planning meetings we have discussed all manner of issues around stop search and not ONCE referred to race or racism. I intend to raise this issue constructively for a meaningful discussion before we go public.'
'1','2312','10 months<br />1) review work completed have we identified anything?<br />2) what feedback has been obtained.<br />3) what have i done to improve understanding of staff? has it had any tangable improvement.'
'1','2317','In 10 months if I am still here
'1','2334','10 weeks.<br />I will seek to ensure that the revised approach is discussed and shared with my team and that we discuss how our own individual approaches and attitudes to race and diversity are impacting on HR systems

'1','2326','10 months - to still care about GMP and help if asked (but not as a consultant).  Success could mean I won&#039;t be asked - that would be great.  To take the lessons into whatever I do in my future be it in a work or private life environment.'
'1','2296','10 months:Given the internal impacts on the external
'1','2329','Ten Weeks<br />Consider how we ensure that issues of proportionality are considered in future technology provision - e.g. considering issues of proportionality in all encounters and how we report on these.  Seek to include within revised management information framework.'

'1','2299','Ten Months:<br />Identify a person from the group with whom I engaged at the ten week point who I could develop a longer lasting and deeper reaching relationship to act as mentor or coach.

'1','2410','Have we approached school re sharing their facilities or to share ours and share in cost?'
'1','2390','must remember all teams

'1','2417','instead of word of mouth can we advertise in local papers for players'
'1','2407','Lewisham council? Are we the only rugby club in Lewisham? If so we have no competiition and this must be a plus point - why are we receiving awards form Greenwich?'
'1','2394','do we pay players...sorry'

'1','2396','There is no need for a bigger ground - 2 pitches should be enough'

'1','2394','should we be a feeder club to Blackheath?'
'1','2395','but we were lucky to have 22 players that hit their peak at the same time will we have that again'
'1','2400','no'
'1','2397','What about web site enquiries?'
'1','2414','we certainly need to attract new players. to do this we need to offer incentives'
'1','2404','not relevant to club spirit'
'1','2400','do they want us to be ?'
'1','2394','what happened to the meetings with the player coach at Blackheath...four players were supposed to come down.'
'1','2387','This sort of club is always going to go in peaks and troughs. Especially if we do not pay players - which I don&#039;t think we should.'
'1','2400','what is a feeder club ?'
'1','2411','realistically I think we should be competing in london 1 and challenging for some silverware in perhaps the kent cup'
'1','2407','possibility of dropping the &#039;old&#039; in old colfeian - it implies that we are closed and must be an ex member of the school and resticts opportunity for lottery funding etc.'
'1','2394','all about training at the top end of the club...need more players training'
'1','2397','Set objectives'
'1','2410','We should determine what balance is between league position and values of club.'
'1','2417','whilst players enjoy playing some of us just really enjoy being spectators'
'1','2388','Will you get the players we need to stay in London 1 without banding money about?'
'1','2400','we must always try to improve'
'1','2407','eg Dartfordians used to be &#039;old&#039;'
'1','2411','no'
'1','2404','no way
'1','2397','Paying players can be at many different levels - the cricket club can manage it on a more limited budget - advantages and limitations'
'1','2409','We already need at least 3 pitches
'1','2414','there needs to be a designated member of the committee to be the club&#039;s link to the school'
'1','2393','Varying social events'
'1','2415','all the club can do is help the players achieve the best of thier abiliaty
'1','2390','I would think that the profit made from the bar means subscriptions would have to increase'
'1','2411','advertising has rarely worked unless we&#039;re willing to pay players - which we&#039;re not'
'1','2393','What about a website?'
'1','2396','Why is there a need to stay in London 1 at all costs?'
'1','2388','Lack of transparency with regards to selection discourages people from training.'
'1','2400','and Askeans used to be a decent club !'
'1','2391','Whatever the rugby club does we are still in the hands of the CSC and the contributions to it from the other sports sections - or rather the lack of them. Other sections can sometimes feel like a millstone rather than a benefit.'
'1','2408','what about having a development officer - part-time and mabe paid - whose task would be to recruit from local colleges etc and keep in touch with the rugby boys when they leave school?'
'1','2395','we have a very good website'
'1','2407','lottery funding - the name old colfeins implies a closed club  - must be seen as more open to the community'
'1','2387','We must find ways of increasing sponsorship/advertising money to put back into the club - Richmond for example
'1','2397','Lot of people outside think that they can&#039;t apply!'
'1','2410','With challenges we have is it realistic to add another dimension particularly given our female facilities.'
'1','2394','yes but it is important to draw new players by having a successful 1st xv'
'1','2400','its been tried'
'1','2387','It&#039;s already 50/50 isn&#039;t it?'
'1','2394','we can have that again'
'1','2391','Does the CASC status the CSC has applied for - Community Amateur Sports Club - mean we couldn&#039;t pay players even if we wanted to?'
'1','2390','definatly not'
'1','2411','then why not breakaway - is it essential we are linked to CSC?'
'1','2404','additional space can be found for playing
'1','2388','If we keep the ground
'1','2419','bland statement how can we improve'
'1','2387','There already is. It is Haggis. Not sure what he does to improve the link.'
'1','2400','I thought there was'
'1','2390','It is good but mant of the pages are out of date which is dissapointing'
'1','2404','yes
'1','2415','never'
'1','2395','how'
'1','2400','Do not under rate its importance to the club'
'1','2407','totally agree - no tenant can be expected to improve facilties with no certainty of lease'
'1','2408','probably yes
'1','2396','A big challenge is the 3 years that 18 year olds disappear off to University
'1','2397','School is a great source of talent
'1','2415','in papers and rubgy world'
'1','2411','we cant pay players at present so stop talking about it :)'
'1','2394','it wasn&#039;t luck...it was hard work...it took 5 seasons to get to that point. I think people expect to get there without the work. Young players think that they are owed their position in the leagues. They owe it to the club to stay high in the leagues.'
'1','2388','Below 1st XV level there is never one captain from one week to the next.'
'1','2417','surely hot showers should be a necessity not luxury'
'1','2400','??????????'
'1','2404','yes
'1','2398','for this club to survive we need to strenghten both the playing staff and the coaching staff.  Canterbury have a five year plan with generous sponsorship to attract players - look what they have achieved this season.  No 2nd XV bothering to train means no pressure on 1st XV players - do we want to be a social club or one with real ambition.'
'1','2414','we don&#039;t have the facilities to be able to cope with 40 players training'
'1','2416','do we advertise more/'
'1','2397','if they ever come back - might go anywhere - want people moving into the area'
'1','2387','Agreed
'1','2392','Why are Westcombe Park so much more succesful as a club - apart from paying players - what is the model for their success?'
'1','2407','this bowls club house is quite nice???'
'1','2391','What about keeping older players as members and involved after they finish playing? If Sidcup and W Park have successful events like dinner dances because they have so many older members and alicadoos perhaps we ought to put as much effort in to retaining our members as recruiting new ones. We have 100 player mebers a year and only 65 former players as members. What can the club do to retain their interest and support and involvement?'
'1','2410','Could we sell ground and share Leathersellers facilities?'
'1','2400','who said we can&#039;t'
'1','2395','no it should not be entertained'
'1','2411','players must be allowed to enjoy playing rugby at all standards - and consequently should have a say in what team they play in'
'1','2393','It would ruin the club - a team built out of people who are here just for the money and not because their friends/family play here!'
'1','2397','Lewisham and Greenwich very promising - in cricket we have district committees sitting above the clubs'
'1','2404','having the kids playing in our minis for 10 years and more
'1','2397','web site wont be found unless it is regularly updated with good content'
'1','2391','We often hear the sad news of old members and former players passing away. Can we encourage people to put just a little bit to the club in their will?'
'1','2390','a vital part of why the club is what it is
'1','2396','There is no reason why we can&#039;t organise a good profitable dinner/evening - Previous bad experience shoudn&#039;t be a reason not to try again'
'1','2415','It would ruin the attmosphere of the club
'1','2392','If general apathy sets in then this is what the club will be known for and we will always struggle to attract the quality of player we want and need.'
'1','2400','a lot ?'
'1','2395','this is not necessarily true the captains are there they just haven&#039;t been available'
'1','2387','Blackheath hadan unforseen amount of injuries - 20 1st team players - just before christmas which meant Harvey Biljon (Blackheath player/coach) would not release any players. Conversations continue between OCRFC and Harvey Biljon'
'1','2407','events such as dinner dances are fantastic opportunites but must be fun and in house - why have dinner dances in Swanley? A marquee on the pitches is much more profitable and keeps funds in house....'
'1','2414','i&#039;m constantly hearing about how successful old school boys are in their jobs
'1','2410','Do we really understand what they have done thats different? Could we ask them to allow one of committee to be silent observer so we can properly understand their success?'
'1','2400','that has also been tried'
'1','2398','that is a ridiculous comment - W Park and Blackheath manage it - as a coach I would love to work with those numbers'
'1','2395','They are only successful in the first team we are better at 2nd and 3rd team level'
'1','2415','Yes but you still need the right players to work with.'
'1','2407','other facitities - tennis for the ladies and all ? encourages more memebers and more diversity'
'1','2397','No
'1','2404','lets keep it to friends of friends rather than recruiting for players. Otherwise our spirit will be changed fo ever. If I wanted that I&#039;d go to Blackheath!!'
'1','2393','Promoting the facilities to city firms.'
'1','2387','How do we know this - where is the evidence?'
'1','2408','can wenot have use of the school pitches - perhaps do a deal with them?'
'1','2413','How do we make training &quot;fun&quot; for the less able players that they don&#039;t feel they are just cannon fodder for the firsts'
'1','2417','mini&#039;s- other schools in area could be advised of old colfeans as a lot of local schools say in Blackfen are already involved with Sidcup'
'2','0','Values
'1','2394','what about links to greenwich university?'
'1','2387','Old Patesians don&#039;t have any obvious problems'
'1','2397','school has a directory of members which tells you how successful they are and where they work'
'1','2388','Events are limited at the club because of the state of it.'
'1','2393','Create a visual identity. Sponsored leisurewear/playing kit/matchday tracksuits'
'1','2408','it could be by the end of the year
'1','2391','The school charges all parents for their kids to be life members of the CSC
'1','2404','The minis will create a 2nd stream of colfeians even though they may never have gone to colfes as about half the minis are at other schools'
'1','2411','this goes back to recruiting the right players who are willing to train regardless of work/girlfriend/wives commitments'
'1','2410','Can we approach local scool senior sides that dont have obvious old boys or senior club connection?i'
'1','2398','they dont train because they have no ambition'
'2','0','What would make for a great club night and bring in the money?'
'1','2393','Good idea!!'
'1','2414','the club may suffer if it is a closed shop there are many comments to that affect already'
'1','2407','regular contact is a great idea - e-mail lists should not be too difficualt to achieve'
'1','2397','Easy to spend a lot of effort on events which only raise a few hundred quid. Better to concentrate on projects which raise at least &pound;10k'
'1','2388','If there is a worry about 2010 what are we doing about looking around for other facilities?'
'1','2414','for that you need a larger coaching set up/space'
'1','2411','agreed thats a shocking comment - i&#039;d love to train with 39 players and the facilities are more than adequate to manage it'
'1','2396','This is a highly valid comment especially for Thursdays - When more than 20 turn up - so B4 November'
'1','2397','No
'1','2394','Each generation develops their own identity but I think that what is missing is the cavalier spirit that I associate with being a colfeian. Teams such as the 4th team and vets play in different kit...?????'

'1','2387','ery important and this is one way to keep people coming down to the club both while playing and not playing.'
'1','2404','never ever ever'
'1','2407','we are a rugby club - ergo we have lots of males - ergo why not events such as speed dating
'1','2409','The minis and youth just pay subs but are not members of the Club. They should be encouraged to join early - poss include membership in subs and give membership card. This is a resource we are mising.'
'1','2391','Unlike Richmond and London Scottish we can&#039;t attract people to events at the club in the company of former international players so they are keen to book tables and invite their friends and work colleagues/contacts'
'1','2388','If you play against semi professional sides this is will what happen. There are not many people who will play for free when they can get paid elsewhere.'
'1','2415','We have contact with the last year of school who will be leaving this year
'1','2394','Yes...the club!!! not just different teams like the 4&#039;s and vets who are like seperate entities.'
'1','2410','Should we subsidise tours for key players at university to encourage them back to the club?'
'1','2397','If they have a history of playing here for many years it will be easier than if they have&#039;t ever played here
'1','2396','Never never'
'1','2400','these are the same choices as there always have been'
'1','2397','Because they stop when they are busiest at work
'1','2400','I think thats why we are here'
'1','2411','thats true - from what i&#039;ve heard there is no team spirit amongst them'
'1','2418','ok fair enough but how do we make the nights fun for them?'
'1','2397','Can get loads of funding for girls sport'
'1','2395','totally agree but we need support outside of the players'
'1','2387','What constitutes a young player? 28 young or is 19 young? I don&#039;t think anyone takes it for granted
'1','2404','No way
'1','2394','concerned about the lack of youngsters who believe in the spirit of the club...that takes time and investment and commitment.'
'1','2398','have you ever been to a training session - if you had been you would know that is never geared to the elite.'
'1','2391','Local firms perceive the club to be the exclusive reserve of people who used to go to a fee paying school
'1','2390','I do not think they are as successful as is thought talking to them the 1st team are very much a club within a club'
'1','2393','Using children from the school/local youth clubs as ball boys and girls'
'1','2407','surely within a london borough with 2012 Olympics looming there are funds to be tapped into and councils willing and eager to sponsor succesful clubs in their area?'
'1','2411','its been proposed we have a poker night with some alternative entertainment
'1','2404','most school players are aligned with a minis section at a club already
'1','2387','Agreed but the lower sides also need to get more involved socially
'1','2404','this should be done with flyers and direct mailing
'1','2394','more attractive bar staff'
'1','2400','its only the money and the good time supporters that some success attract'
'1','2407','waste of time and effort - they never have and never will seek to assisit local clubs - always a one way street'
'1','2395','what are they lets hear them'
'1','2402','the bar needs to be more comfortable
'1','2411','one person cannot be expected to write articles / match reports etc as well as uploading the data its all time consuming - its always been the case that if someone writes an article it will be posted'
'1','2414','that&#039;s great but is there anybody tapping into this resource. i know the school is so should the club not be aswell'
'1','2387','No ambition or do they just not like training.'
'1','2416','necessity for keeping closer ties with players at college and university'
'1','2411','its about getting several players from each team to throw there 2pence at it and write articles'
'1','2395','why do we want women at the club'
'1','2404','no we dont and no we shouldn&#039;t
'1','2407','invite the coaches and 1st team cpatains of the local rugby playing schools to the club suppoer of other events???'
'1','2396','Pretty much every Tuesday &amp; Thursday for about 6 years &amp; I&#039;m sorry but Thursdays are'
'1','2403','to expect a benefit in the senior club from a successful mini section does not always follow.  Not many current Blackheath 1st team players have come through their mini and junior section.  In fact it would be interesting to see if many of their players are from local schools.'
'1','2387','Proud'
'2','0','Committee structure'
'1','2397','you could always try making new friends!'
'1','2411','more music nights has been proposed but the reason the night has proved so successful is because people haven&#039;t become bored of it by having one monthly - its essentially the same night and we shouldn&#039;t overdo it'
'1','2410','If we continued in national leagues would spirit of being an old boys club be able to survive?'
'1','2394','When I joined I felt like I had to step up in order to maintain the level of playing...I think that young players are arrogant and do not appreciate the history of the club and what players have achieved before them.'
'1','2415','Contact details for the leavers are kept
'1','2391','Full income from sponsorship includes companies that sponsor the club in exchange for some international tickets at Twickenham
'1','2404','good
'1','2408','if there is still going to be two or three years before the lease is sorted
'1','2387','A very well run summer ball or party somewhere in the local vicinity at a venue where people actually want to go to
'1','2402','these are all suggestions to keep a male club. All succesfull clubs have encourage the family.'
'1','2397','Most colfes school leavers are now interested in fitness training
'1','2395','i disagree if the numbers are there then the &quot;elite&quot; can play against the &quot;Non elite&quot;'
'1','2411','summer ball has been tried and it fell on its face -events MUST be run during the season when people can be made more aware of it'
'1','2400','ambition fro what'
'1','2411','nope you got me? anyone got any ideas?'
'1','2405','Do we place too much emphasis on the success of the 1st XV?   In other words have we become elitist?'
'1','2393','Would generate more money behind the bar.'
'1','2402','the school can organise a summer ball
'1','2394','there are brilliant players out there who want to play for fun...what I believe is that we have to attract them to the fun aspect. Look at Hyder or Andy Baker
'1','2404','quite right
'1','2414','i think that is a very short sighted view. the club has to think about it&#039;s survival and it should consider this as an option. the professional game will get bigger and bigger and we must be on the train in one capacity or another.'
'1','2397','we have list of greenwich and lewisham schools
'1','2409','Is there a coordinator for managers/players etc to pass on info to?'
'1','2404','and they have people knocking each others teetch out at club suppers'
'1','2393','Would generate interest from the local community.'
'1','2387','Great more red tape and long drawn out committee meetings that don&#039;t achieve anything. To a club (rugby club) like this that is on the whole well run we need direct financial support not another pseudo governing body telling us what to do.'
'1','2408','We should market ourselves more agressively
'1','2391','Match reports are hardly ever in my local paper in Greenwich. If we want more members (and more programme advertisers and sponsors) it might help if more people in the local area had a chance to read about us.'
'1','2417','when we were in the 3 south league both the players and the alacadoos were much happier and much more positive'
'1','2392','Yes exactly - set the sights higher. There must be huge potential for coprorate sponsorship provided it is approached in a professional manner.'
'1','2394','We can attract talented players by simply being a fun club...playing cavalier rugby'
'1','2407','re- vamp the club supper - ther eis only so much steak and kidney pie a man can eat in a badminton hall - invite other reps. from schools
'1','2397','Have you thought of offering modest scholarships to promising school-leavers who need to raise money to go to uni? Good way of tying them in
'1','2402','thats a problem with any youth
'1','2395','But we hold events that could involve the family/wifes and its always the same people turn up'
'1','2403','the amateur approach is definitely the right approach.  But he consquences are that OC&#039;s will be a yo-yo side.  Relegated one year and promoted the next.'
'1','2415','yes
'1','2414','these are becoming few and far between we need to change with them'
'1','2393','My wife would insist on picking me up on a Saturday evening instead of me begging for a lift home!!!!'
'1','2390','The overall position and way in which the complete club is organised and run has a major effect on what the Rugby Club should do. We always seem to get this item pushed away
'1','2404','top comment
'1','2397','it&#039;s a community!'
'1','2392','In that case the image needs to be changed in the local market
'1','2391','A midweek (or Friday) club lunch for members and guests. Sell tables for people (the sort of people with business expenses) to bring guests to hear a chat between John Gallagher and Ben Clarke about latest rugby events and news'
'1','2395','im not sure what ideas have you got as the organiser of this event lets hear it'
'1','2388','Success I feel comes from the top down. However emphasis on the 1st XV should not mean neglect of other sides.'
'1','2415','never never never'
'1','2409','Best thing we can do is to tie in the younger players who are not yet members'
'1','2393','Entertainment committee'
'1','2410','Should get committee to do self apparaisal of whats worked and not worked over last ten years. Also see if it is consistent with what regular players perceive of club and committee.'
'1','2404','this is happening now'
'1','2398','they have NO ambition.'
'1','2414','the minis will grow and grow and so this will help with members later'
'1','2407','and even easier for us as they have no grounds to play on!!!'
'1','2404','of course no
'1','2413','If there is a problem with the rest of the club/CSC should the whole club be run by the rugby section?'
'1','2415','completly agree
'1','2416','greater dress code is required to maintain playing standards'
'1','2418','ok so you don&#039;t want to pay
'1','2397','If you&#039;re serious about a complete review of everything
'1','2390','This along with many other jobs required by the club needs someone to put there name forward. We can not expect the same people todo everything'
'1','2407','does membership of the club enable to participate in other sports eg squash - I have no idea?'
'1','2387','Exactly just accept that we will peak and trough if we stay as an amateur club. It should not come as a suprise'
'1','2410','To do that you would need proper floodlights but ist feasible.'
'1','2408','We have a website which is good in parts
'1','2387','If they can&#039;t commit to the majority of the season then they should not be captain&#039;s'
'1','2418','not entirely true or indeed fair - they are keen to develop a relationship beyond O&#039;Neill&#039;s'
'1','2391','Ability seems to have less effect on which team people play for than it used to. Each side seems to have its own squad and players more want their side to do well than for themselves personally to move up the club and play in a higher team. Plenty of people want to play only with ther mates. How does this sit with the &quot;spirit of the club&quot; as opposed to the spirit of the individual?'
'1','2404','lets have a formalised social calender that is fixed each year
'1','2397','contact the London Leisure College at Charlton Athletic - they have money and resources to develop local sports'
'1','2393','Using our resources. A few weeks back we had JG
'1','2404','they spend all day sunday here and it is difficult to get them here satuday as well'
'1','2411','I agree with first comment - poaching players from lower leagues clubs is common place and rarely frowned upon. there are more than able players competing in lower leagues who would jump at the opportunity to play in a higher league and not expect to be paid - these players i bet would commit to training'
'1','2393','Harsh!!'
'1','2413','what do we do to encourage more players for the lower sides and then improve them'
'1','2394','they need quality leadership'
'1','2409','Does the club have a mailing list for these school members  - so we can let them (or their parents) know what we can offer and ask them what we could provide them?'
'1','2390','the Old Colfeians spirit'
'1','2397','Parents of minis are a great resource to do all kinds of jobs - coaching
'1','2410','Have we tried to make use of theschool development database to track down or stay in touch with players from the missing years?'
'1','2417','old colfeans was originally a grammer school and not a fee paying school'
'1','2411','does that mean we could get playing shirts that fit?'
'1','2395','agreed why not breakaway?'
'1','2415','You are very lucky to get 1 let alone anymore mini&#039;s per age group go all the way through the ranks to 1st team. It&#039;s about getting as many as possible to come back to the club when they finish university and that won&#039;t be many.'
'1','2397','How well do we communicate with them?'
'1','2414','not so. i think that getting 40 players to training would be great
'1','2407','does no mean we have not asked???<br />What is wrong with sharing and expanding?'
'1','2387','To keep the spirit of the club as we know it and to be bale to build on what has already been achieved we must stay at Horn Park. Moving to another location will see us take a considerable step back in terms of development.'
'1','2393','Who?'
'1','2396','Touring is becoming splintered within the club - last season there were two seperate tours - clubs within clubs???'
'1','2405','Before we proceed with the new lease
'1','2387','Rugby with the Fun left in'
'1','2404','yes
'1','2413','how do we coach the lower sides and encourage them to play in a higher team'
'1','2391','If people here make such good friendships
'1','2411','quite right'
'1','2403','With semi-pro clubs being promoted into the league it means that the league has become a lot harder.  So the standard of OC&#039;s playing probably hasn&#039;t diminished
'2','0','How could we exploit the energy that will surround the world cup 2007?'
'1','2416','essential that players express themselves regardless what league they are playing in'
'1','2410','No reason why not but will be competing with school on this.'
'1','2407','that is a very poor negotiating position - we must stand firm and demand a decision much earlier than that - if we tentaively arrange an alternative we can announe that we will leave unless position is clarified - give them the problem - do not allo wthem to have all the cards.'
'1','2394','the food is awful. Players don&#039;t even get a meal after a game.'
'1','2397','Lot to be said for identifying players who don&#039;t go to university - lot of local clubs don&#039;t lose as many youngsters to university as we do. non-public schools are better for this'
'1','2387','Already have a social sec but that person has to work hard to really drive events forward. It takes a lot of time and energy.'
'1','2414','they won&#039;t come if they get offered &pound;40 a match a there tin pot club'
'1','2408','Having a single committee doing everything is not the most efficient way of running the club. There should be a playing sub-committee
'1','2404','if we are running 5 sides I am pleased we are a succesfull club regardless of the 1st xv'
'1','2397','why?'
'1','2393','Totally agree. Standards are getting worse. Perhaps a standard shirt for all?'
'1','2387','Er...you still need ladies for speed dating unless of course you are gay?'
'1','2415','Not enough people to support the social aspect
'1','2392','yes agree - more should be done to encourage the local community to come and support the club. To do that though we need to be able to offer them a decent facility and perceived value for money - competitvely priced drinks etc.'
'1','2396','The key area of recruitment is people playing for us at 16-18 (colts or 3rd/4ths) before they go to Uni
'1','2404','here here'
'1','2411','i&#039;ll never forget her!!'
'1','2405','We need to make up our minds about the female element before we rebuild.'
'1','2411','nice idea - not sure how we&#039;d work it though'
'1','2402','we saw a massive surge in interest in the mini section following the last world cup. We need to encourage the juniors 12
'1','2407','why not organise an event for them the first year they leave school - a reunion perhaps?'
'1','2415','It needs to ruled out
'1','2408','The junior teams are as much part of the club as the first team squad. We need to ensure that everyone
'1','2391','Decency
'1','2414','the 1sts are the market area of the club. you need to get a fine balance between elite and mass participation/fun'
'1','2387','No you can&#039;t tap the same market as they are unlikely to go to 2 very similar eventsin sucha short  space of time. Also do you have any idea how much work is involved in organising a ball for 200  people. I&#039;ll tell you - LOTS - it is practically a full time job for 2-3 weeks.'
'1','2397','Agreed
'1','2388','You&#039;ll get a load of students that take a free week on the hammer that you will never see again.'
'1','2394','This is the essence of recruitment. We are a completely different type of club...we should exploit it...that is what will attract the players....sweatbands
'1','2403','are the vets a different club?  there must have been at least 30 players throughout the club that have played for the vets this season.'
'1','2404','this is a big area for potential improvment'
'1','2391','Integral part of the club&#039;s spirit and values - tours are for every member regardless of which team they play in
'1','2395','sorry this is no longer the case we have addressed this very well over the course of the last 2 years and whilst its not exstingushed totally it is a lot better'
'1','2394','disappointed that there are only a few comments here'
'1','2415','We need to make sure that the club is open for all the games and that the large screen is set up.'
'1','2393','Host our own &#039;World Cup&#039;. Another local club ran one very succesfully.'
'1','2417','the web sight for both old colfeans and the mini&#039;s should be greatly improved more news as to when something is happening and not when it has happened.'
'1','2387','This is a great idea - university captains etc...Something for the committee to take up - could be worked in to the role of the social sec.'
'1','2394','I agree...Ian Martin is a great coach and fits the club'
'1','2397','A lot of clubs it has been the making of them
'1','2408','There are clubs around that do rely substantially on players coming through their mini and junior sides. The key seems to be to make the minis and the junior sections feel part of the club as a whole.'
'1','2414','to get more money!!!!'
'1','2393','Needs a group rather than individual so can spread the load and generate more ideas.'
'1','2392','in that case we need to keep potential players up to date with club affairs/progress - good or bad - out of sight out of mind'
'1','2402','I have a fair idea...we&#039;ll forget it then.'
'1','2404','Dennis and Smiffy always used to do this unofficially a few years ago
'1','2387','True but did JG
'1','2411','its the same 8/9 players who commit - no event can be organised off the back of this'
'1','2415','not many clubs have many than 3 pitches
'1','2396','Commitment and hard work is key
'1','2395','playing for the enjoyment of mates not for any old farts but for ourselves'
'1','2411','agree - even if they only go as far as the 2nd team - if they&#039;re training and committing to it
'1','2397','which has absolutely nothing to do with it'
'1','2394','all of the club should wear the same shirts not like it is currently with different teams playing in different kit.'
'1','2413','Should we have a man of the match award for each side to generate more interest every week/month'
'1','2388','Laurence Dallagio will be at the end of his professional career after the next world cup. Lets contact Wasps and see if we can get him on a a free transfer.'
'1','2404','what makes you think we want to improve
'1','2414','come on take the blinkers off'
'1','2393','I was talking about adults who would travel to see some rugby legends!'
'1','2404','javascript:selectComment(&#039;12437&#039;)'
'1','2397','Coaching is the area where payment can make the greatest contribution
'1','2387','Problem here is most people at this club think things like this just happen. It is a case of 20% of the people doing 80% of the work. It also then needs to be publicised because there is no point having a screen up if no-one watches it.'
'1','2411','ha!'
'1','2411','yeah they will'
'1','2404','sorry I meant spirit'
'1','2395','Its got to be Thailand Next...'
'1','2411','ok now i see you and i still dont think its right'
'1','2415','I think that alot of effort is already made to make the mini section part of the club. However the mini section never respond in a positive way to any invitations
'1','2407','er - you advertise'
'1','2398','perhaps he needs to be convinced that the club has the drive and ambition to play at the highest level possible.'
'1','2394','we have to get over the past...the main thing to remember is that successful sides have had great team spirit....Blackheath were frightened of it when they came here...you can&#039;t buy that... senior players have to get involved in developing the spirit.'
'1','2396','100!'
'1','2391','The origin of the Vets team is unique in the club. It&#039;s meant for players over 35
'1','2403','Blackheath are already in there. But an enquiry from OC&#039;s might produce something else.'
'1','2413','can we get more publicity in local newspapers etc which will encorage awareness and more members'
'1','2404','because we are a club for former colfes pupils and their friends and familiy
'1','2387','Yes it still happens
'1','2411','we could play bulldogs'
'1','2400','indeed this used to happen with 2/3 schoolboys being invited to tour initially subsidised by the club and then on the big tour subsidised by the tour itselfi'
'1','2417','yes please!! we will supply him with bed and board'
'1','2394','they are not asked.'
'1','2408','Being a traditional club

'1','2412','the minis are to most people no more than<br />a cheap baby sitting service'
'1','2395','nice one mulders!!'
'1','2404','within reason this is good anyway'
'1','2415','Do we think that we can carry on with the coaching structure we currently have
'1','2405','This the gist of the future - do we want to remain a &quot;good old fashioned rugby Club&quot; or do we aspire to a higher status?   If the answer be the latter
'1','2396','Touring is becoming splintered within the club - last season there were two seperate tours - clubs within clubs???'
'1','2402','you are talking about people who by large have young family - they&#039;re not all young free and single'
'1','2397','Put the prices up and make more money!'
'1','2416','can we have along tour everyfew years to keep the excitement going'
'1','2414','incentives doesn&#039;t have to mean money'
'1','2404','by suffer do you mean drop out of london 1
'1','2415','all sides need to wear the same shirt as their is only one colfian shirt.'

I want to do my coaching badges for mini rugby so that I can support my nephew in his playing career.<br />I also want to get more involved in the social side of the club...get back involved with music nights and DJ&#039;ing.'

'1','2391','Continue to be &quot;active&quot; member and consider taking on element of whatever has beed formalised as longer term plan. Fundamental to achieving beyond what we have now is further syndication and spreading of the load. Also seems that we have to recognise that our continuing longevity and prosperity is twinned with the Association and that although possible to breakaway its not a likely outcome. Given this a number of people will have to be willng to not only serve the needs of the Rugby Club but also recognise the maybe even greater need of the Association.'
'1','2413','I am going to continue my role as team secretary which currently means we are able to get more than one team out each week
'1','2412','I&#039;m going to sort my neck out and get back to training on a regular basis. I will commit myself to the committee meetings. I will endevour to be diligent in my attendance at the committee&#039;s regular monthly meetings.<br />I will dedicate some of my time to positively contribute to the five year development plan when a tangible way of doing so emerges. I will be proactive
'1','2406','I will strive to gell the mini/youth sections together as one club so future generations of members grow up in one club rather than the fragmented often confrontational sections that exist at present
'1','2390','Continuing to support the club as much as possible. Encouraging others to do the same. Hopefully by 2007 and assuming things are going to plan attracting new membership and support will have become  more easily achievable.'
'1','2392','I will work with the junior section to ensure that we have successful under 15s and under16s who will
'1','2410','I hope there will be something better to watch the Rugby World Cup games on than the existing tv set
'1','2394','Turn the manger role for the 1st team into a something that covers other sides. This will mean the job requirements to be spread across a small dedicated team that should lead to people appointed for the other sides below the 1st.<br />Hopefully this would give a boost to the 2nds &amp; 3rds particually and make the management of them easier for the captains and coaches. Plus of course improve the standard and enjoyment for the people playing.'

'1','2405','Improve the relationship with the school. To achieve this I will make visits to the school to hold meetings with the 6th form as a whole to telll them what is on offer for them at the CSC. In particular to encourage the rugby players to start to train at the club and play for the club when they leave school or university.<br />To continue to support the mini section and try to intergrate them into the club more.<br />To continue to train and encourage others to train.'
'1','2407','We have to ensure that we are playing at a level that satisfies the total membership of the Club.   We have to improve our facilities and be prepared to finance realistically our goals.   We must never lose sight of our roots and should engender the spirit of rugby and the old Colfeians in those that follow us.<br />There is an intellectual argument that says that planning for the future is futile and that theory should be bourne in mind!'
'1','2416','I Will keep playing
'1','2415','i would like to help the club to keep it&#039;s friendly spirit and ethos which ultimately
'1','2409','My effort will be in gathering and keeping the U15s into a viable team that wants to play together for this club (win or lose) because they enjoy it and are proud of it. Hopefully we can help forge friendships between those players that we last their lifetimes.'

'1','2862','Is someone in transit considered to be in the territory for arrest purposes'
'1','2862','can we refuse to try our own national and refuse to extradite'
'1','2949','I dont see a reason why not even if actual prosecution comes as a result of extridition (opps) may be a convention problem though'

'1','2949','we can do what amounts to a controlled delivery in that we monitor the indivual ans make the arrest when the ship gets into port'
'1','2956','Extradition has always been regarded as an act of State and it therefore engages both the judiciary and the executive. The final surrender is generally an executive act. The basic tenet of extradition is double criminality

'1','2862','ok'
'1','2949','hypocrital political foreign policy that suggests for the want of a better word racism(selective)'
'1','2895','why is it smaller states like those exisiting in this region faces high international scrutiny when it comes to the issue of the death penalty while the US not too far off from us executes quite a sizeable number yearly'
'1','2912','If a State is not a signatory to or has ratified  this UN Convention and has no laws treating on extradiction
'1','2862','how is this relevant to our own work in policing our borders - its high politics'
'1','2937','why the lack of reciprosity-ref england and germany---one country want but not willing to give'
'1','2876','What sort of sanctions would a state suffer if they do not sign/ratify/implement these conventions'
'1','2895','a withdrawal of international assistance in the forms of loans and grants'
'1','2956','regrettably no. If I may let me illustrate this by way of a case exampe: Algeria sought the extradition of a suspect accused of terrorism from the UK. As there is no treaty between Algeria &amp; UK
'1','2862','The security council resolutions dealing with terrorism are made under Ch 7 of the UN Charter
'1','2862','Its not really about sanctions for not ratifying - its about seeing your own national interest in this
'1','2862','European Convention countries will not under their convention extradite someone to a country practicing the death penalty
'1','2956','There is a prohibition on the return of fugitives or providing mutual legal assistance where the requesting state has the death penalty
'1','2958','Informally obtained evidence can be used in court.the general principle asto whether informal or formal request is needed is whether a coercive power is to be exercised in the requested state; eg
'1','2862','I think the US also gets attention for death penalty - it may not feel like if from here; sometimes the criticism is about mandatory sentence of death where the courts cannot hear evidence in mitigation'
'1','2862','It is a basic principle of this area of law that you either try the person yourself or render him to others who wish to try him; what relevance if he is a national or not?'
'1','2958','Re: MLA: yes; but it needs to be drafted wider than &#039;treaty&#039; so as to cover arrangements and schemes (such as The Harare Scheme) . In fact
'1','2956','Extradition is an act of State and is therefore entitled under international law to refuse a request for extradition. This is reflected in all the extradition treaties/conventions under the general heading of &#039;grounds for refusal&#039;. The UN Conventions silently acknowledge the right of State to refuse to extradite and hence the &#039;poltical offence&#039; exception is specificlly set out.<br />In so far as mutual legal assistance is concerned
'1','2862','It will depend on their own law; but if the person is physically present in your area
'1','2958','Re: MLA and informal requests:<br />An MLA request for evidence can be made even in the absence of a bilateral or multilateral. However
'1','2956','The US
'1','2958','Lack of reciprocity in that example simply because of odd position that UK does not allow evidential use of UK intercept (intel only)
'1','2863','How would one deal with a continous offence
'1','2956','The Conventions recognise 2 bases - territorial &amp; active personality test (nationality of offender but States can assert jurisdiction of the grounds of nationality of victim (passive) and national security. However
'1','2958','Not on that ground alone. Similarly
'1','2956','A33 of The Refugee Convention sets out the non-refoulment principle. Where a person has been granted political asylum it is unlikely that an extradition request would succeed. However practical approaches can be considered such as trying the person in another part of the requesting state; but this will depend on the basis of the grant of asylum'
'1','2956','I wonder if you would be so kind as to clarify what you mean by &#039;which country gets his access&#039;?'
'1','2876','this seems to amount to encouraging safe havens as the UK has taken a hypocritical stance'
'1','2937','derivative information----how would you go about teaching some one to observe/see/use this info or is it just an instinctive thing'
'1','2956','Evey state affected can claim jurisdiction
'1','2956','wholly agree with your observation. The issues of laws of war and international humantiarian law are quite distinct from what we are considering in this workshop.'
'1','2862','The asylum process must run its course - extradition proceedings will normally be on hold until this time'
'1','2956','Most CW states extradite their own nationals unless there is a constitutional bar to surrendering the national. So its not a ground for refusal unless national basic law so provides'
'1','2862','I think you mean that if your national is extradited to X and tried and convicted
'1','2956','You must show jurisdiction as it is the basis of justiciability
'1','2862','These are two separate issues - high seas
'1','2958','Certainly at odds with position in most other states. Rationale is that by keeping non-evidential there will not be disclosure of methodology and extent or otherwise of tapping will not be revealed. Conversely
'1','2862','This is a bit strong a response - the fact that for other reasons UK law does not allow intercepts in evidence yet
'1','2956','Can you please clarify &#039;transit&#039;? If you mean the person has landed in the country and is on the landside of an airport
'1','2862','I mean &#039;airside&#039;'
'1','2956','Offences committed on an aircraft - here the State in which the aircraft is registered has deemed extended jurisdiction and can therefore properly try the matter'
'1','2956','where an offence is committed in territorial waters; the coastal state enjoys jurisdiction.'
'1','2956','Airside is a lot more complicated because you have a combination of being in the country but not entered the country - generally speaking the consensus is that airside is excluded as the person has not entered the country; so in a recent incident a person for whom a warrant was issued remained on the aircraft having learnt of the warrant
'1','2956','Yes most states only recognise territorial jurisdiction; in fact all common law countries only operate on the basis of territorial jurisdiction unless the Statute provides active personality jurisdiction'
'1','2956','absolutely - because that is abduction/irregular extradition!'
'2','2965','Your experience of the abuse of charities'
'2','2965','Your perception of the use of charities'
'2','2965','What control mechanisms do you think would work'
'2','2965','Do you think that Hawala is a community service or a convienient tool for criminals/terrorists to move money'
'1','2862','I am glad you put a second question on use of charities - we should remember that most charities are very valuable to our societies - it is a pity if counter-terrorism leads to general suspicion of charities and NGOs. This needs to be handled carefully'
'1','2862','Charities are subject to audits like any other body; there is a danger of profiling some religious charities which are bona fide - this will only lead to resentment in that community'
'1','2862','Many people in caribbean rely on remittances from UK
'1','2863','-the need to declare the source of the funds<br />-the need to ensure the identity of the sender
'1','2937','I think the use of charities is a common way to transfer money by terrorist---what suggesttions would you make for a small country to deal with this problem'
'1','2863','I think this system which is somewhat different from the remittance system allows a person to circumvent the system as it relates to the identification of the sender and recipient
'1','2895','the system of charity similarly to most systems have been perverted. many so called charities is responsible for the funding of many terrorist groups. this is not the fault of the system of charity of a result of the &#039;ingenuity&#039; of man'
'1','2862','i dont think outlawing alternative systems is the answer - if it is driven underground it will be invisible - it needs regulation but not overregulation surely'
'1','2864','Hawala builds contacts thereby feeding organised networking'
'1','2862','we must be careful not to try to paint all charities with the same brush - any good system can be abused
'1','2876','howdoes the hawala agent finally get paid'

There is however sufficient detail in the images to confirm the descriptions given of Subjects 1 and 2 provided by Mr OLUWESU and also to offer the following descriptive points re Subjects 3 and 4:<br />Subject 3 - Male

'1','3123','1010 Message 8 - Intelligence Unit<br />CCTV from the REGENTS PARK LT station has revealed that two suspects matching the description of Subjects 1 and 2 entered the station using Oyster cards at the barriers at 0851 hrs (CCTV timing).  Officers at scene have identified the actual barrier they passed through and we are liaising with TFL re the Oyster cards used.'
'2','3122','Message 9'
'1','3123','1015 Message 9 - C3000 staff<br />Officers are now in situ at DM viewing local authority and traffic camera footage of the area of Marylebone Road with the aim of identifying the vehicle used.'
'2','3122','Message 10'
'1','3123','1035 Message 10 - Intelligence Unit<br />Through liaison with the operational team we have established that a series of four people passed through the barrier identified at REGENTS PARK LT followed by a  space of about 10 seconds before the two subjects who were not followed by anyone else until about 40 seconds later - all at about 0851 hrs.  Liaison with the data-holders for the Oyster card system has identified a corresponding sequence on their database which has initially identified the following two Oyster card numbers as belonging to Subjects 1 and 2.  The full data sequence from the barrier is being passed to the officers who have access to the CCTV images so that they can compare a wider time period and confirm that we are looking at the right Oyster card users (in case of disparity in the timings).<br />Further details to follow asap re the Oyster cards identified.'
'2','3122','Message 11'
'1','3148','1047 Message 11 - Intelligence Unit<br />Neither of the Oyster cards identified has been registered by the user and one (blvd used by Subject 2) had not been used before this morning.  The other has been used for the last 9 days consistently and seems to show movements on buses and tubes throughout the West End area throughout each day.  This data is still being mapped and analysed by the Intel Unit but the initial finding is as follows:<br />On each weekday since activation the user has commenced his journey on the number 53 bus towards Elephant and Castle from a bus stop in OLD KENT ROAD.  He has then entered the tube system at Elephant and Castle LT.  On what appears to be his last journey of the day on several occasions during the period he appears to be making a return journey along this route exiting the tube at the Elephant and Castle and boarding a 53 bus eastbound.<br />The inference is that the user resides near the bus stop that he uses in the mornings;  ie. the area of OLD KENT ROAD<br />Analysis of this data continues.'

'2','3122','Message 21'
'1','3123','1227 Message 21 - Intelligence Unit<br />Data has now arrived for the T*114 mobile blvd attributed to Abdi MOHAMMED.  Initial analysis indicates that the phone is still active and is currently in the corresponding cellsite area of his H/A 13B ALLINGTON STREET (ie near the relevant bus stop).   The first activation of the day though was only at 1032 hrs and hence there is nothing to assist in confirming a link with this mornings incident at this stage.  A certain finding is that if he is ident with Subject 1 then he was using a different mobile when seen by Mr OLUWESU than the one we have for him .  The initial cellsite analysis also shows that the phones location over the last week does not appear to reflect the movements identified for Subject 1s Oyster card.'

There are several high frequency contact numbers which are being developed by the intel. unit to assess their possible relevance.<br />The movements of this phone however do not correlate with the movements identified from the Oyster card blvd used by Subject 1.'

'1','3147','1621 Message 40 - Intelligence Unit<br />Previous data for the T*790 number attributed to SALAMEH has a number of high frequency callers dialling in and out.  The first subscribers on these are returning and being researched by the Intel%u2019 cell.  Of interest is the following:<br />T07801486007 - Vodafone contract phone r/k; Mr I. JOVETICA of Flat 9
'1','3147','1632 Message 41 - C3000 staff<br />From Ops team:<br />***OP now established with clear coverage of front door of 13B 6 SHERBORNE STREET
'1','3147','1641 Message 42 - Intelligence Unit<br />Data now obtained on T07961810524 (possible alternative/linked number for SALAMEH - in use with other handset)<br />This number has activated on the network one week ago and has used the handset identified through SALAMEH%u2019s other number constantly since activation.  Of particular interest is the following:<br />-	The activation date correlates exactly with the cessation of activity on T*790<br />-	The number appears to call a specific grouping of 4 other mobile numbers only and no hardlines<br />-	There are no common numbers with the data obtained for T*790<br />-	The usage is both intermittent and limited - unlike T*790 - and text messaging appears to be favoured over voice-calls<br />-	From the limited data available (ie this last week only)
'1','3147','1650 Message 43 - Intelligence Unit<br />Further enquiries on JOVETIK and the T*007 mobile subscribed to him reveal the following:<br />The flat he occupies at FROBISHER ST is part of a Local Authority assisted housing scheme which is predominately occupied by foreign nationals who either are or have sought asylum in the UK.  The premises has a resident landlord who has assisted police before (enqs thru%u2019 local Boro CTIO) and the hardline provided by JOVETIK when registering his phone is the communal line at the property.  An image has now been obtained from the UKIS of JOVETIK and  although this is several years old - there are similarities with the images obtained  of Subject 4.<br />Of particular note is that his T*007 phone number last registered on the vodafone network 6 days ago and has not registered since.  There were no handset changes and the IMEI has not been identified on any network since this time.  Clearly this apparent cessation of usage correlates with that seen on SALAMEH%u2019s T*790 phone.'
'1','3147','1710 Message 44 - C3000 staff<br />OP update:<br />IC1 female in Muslim headscarf (face visible only) sighted in front window of 6 SHERBORNE STREET.  Photograph obtained by OP.'
'1','3147','1715 Message 45 - Intelligence Unit<br />There is no record of a female residing at the premises with SALAMEH on any of our indices or with the local Authority etc.<br />Further call data updates indicate the following:<br />-	T07961810524 was cellsited at the W10 mast at 0717hrs today when it sent a text message to T07957772989.   T*524 was then cellsited again at 0848 hrs in the W1 area just south of REGENTS PARK.<br />-	T07957772989 is one of four other numbers with which T*524 has exclusively contacted since activation one week ago (T07961810523
'1','3147','1725 Message 46 - C3000 staff<br />Update from SO13 Ops team:<br />Feedback from contact made with landlord at FROBISHER STREET indicates that JOVETIK is known to the landlord as a very private individual  within the block who has been a relatively long term resident.  He also believes that there is a computer in the flat; although this is third party info and he himself has not been in Flat 9 for some time now.<br />He further states that JOVETIK was last seen yesterday leaving the block and that he is confident that he has not returned and that the flat is empty.  There is a signing in policy which is generally adhered to and JOVETIK is not shown as having returned.'

T07961684390 and T07901637887 have not activated at all today but were cellsited sporadically in the SE1 area (albeit amongst other locations also during the course of the day)  Data on all these numbers is very limited due to the low usage by the users.<br />T07961810523 has activated this morning though (when switched on it has registered on the network to receive a voicemail) and at that time (0746 hrs) it was at the W10 cell mast.   This phone has then sent a text message to the T*524 number at 0947hrs which would imply that this other number has in fact been switched off since that time as this message has not been registered as having been received by the handset for the latter.<br />No update on T*114 (Abdi MOHAMMED) at this stage'

(Nothing at this stage)<br />G1 duty lead warned to anticipate request for fast-time assistance with interception warrantry and to take whatever steps possible to ensure that this can be achieved expeditiously when appropriate.  Appropriately security cleared DS line-reader briefed and stood-by to attend Thames House to ensure any resultant product is immediately conveyed back to Rm 499 (line readers room) in C3000.<br />SO12 C3000 staff to ensure that any and all details that are ascertained about this possible cell are immediately searched through all relevant databases at SO12 upon receipt.  BSS reps will be asked to ensure the same in relation to their databases.  Sanitisations and form of words will not be accepted. This information will not form part of the CLIO log nor be stored on any networked system but will be factored into the overall assessment conducted by the combined Rm 498 Intel team and briefed to the SIO/DSO as part of a single holistic intelligence picture.<br />SCD TSU warned by SIO to establish a presence in C3000 pending possible deployment.  Relevant assets put on stand-by.<br />Initial assessment from SO13 Bomb Data Centre is that without further details it is too difficult to predict what might have been decanted.  Clearly there are descriptive similarities (yellow liquid/containers/rucksacks) with the July attacks of last year and these devices transpired to be peroxide-based explosives.  If this is the case

This has not been confirmed and the statement from the asian man contradicts the english mans so this will need to be looked into further.

'1','3700','turn 3: we now know the problem is significantly bigger and has the potential to be a deliberate act. However there is no link between the persons in the incident report and the poisoning as yet. Both witnesses contradict each other also and will require further interviewing to assess who may be guiltly of the anti-social behaviour. We could do with knowing if the man is recieving packages in the night and if so what they are as this is slightly unusual activity but not illegal. It is also noticable that there are more poisonings closer to the mersey than there are away from it suggesting that that is where it is coming from.'

'1','3702','TURN 3: Because of the two statements and the mention of terrorism i have placed the asian man at around a 10% risk of being the suvject with this needing to be looked into further.  The distribution of the poisonings has also strengthened by idea that the poisoning could be coming from a water supply

The autopsy has confirmed that some type of posoning has been present in one of the victims of the fatalieis that has been present at the royals Liverpool hospital. Keith worked very hard apparently in a flour factory and as an ex chemistry teacher had prime access to spreading chemicals throughout the area of merseyside by poisoning the flour. Similarly the relgious fundementalist seems to be up there with poisoning the city and the shezah character seems to favour this relgious movement. He could have been plotting with the help of others to poison the city of liverpool through various food outlets following the directs of the fundamentalist leaders however this could plurly be conjecture relying on the investigating officers racism to try and lean to blaming these individuals as the criminals.'

'1','3702','TURN 4: I have now found out about a Mr Hussein who has been talking about spreading poison throughout the city in extremist speeches in a mosque.  This is very worrying as it seems to correspond with the patterns of the poisoning.  The autoopsy suggests that this is not food poisoning at all and the fatalities on the mass scale has led me to beliieve that this is not a food chain but some sort of terorist plot.  I think that the asian man questioned earlier about the dispute with his neighbour may be working with this Mr Hussein and spreading poison throughout the city with a chemical weapon or some sort of poison distributed through some means widely used.  I need to know more information about Mr Hussein and suggest questioning him and finding out further blood tests and reports to find out what substance is causing the fatalities and then check this in both mens homes.  I also know Mr Jones dabbles with chemistry and has allegedly given death threats so this also needs to be followed up.'

Granted the company probably did not know but this flower factory appears to be the source of the poisonings around liverpool.  The tension bewtween mr jones and the asian man may have overflowed into their private life but the offender profile and evidence gathered at his property suggests that Mr jones is guilty of this crime.  I want this to be investigated further and find out whether there are any traces of poison in his property and indeed in the flour factory.  This facotry distributes around the liverpool area and beyond and would explain why the main fatalities are near by but there are aslo some in the immediate surroundings.  I believe the &#039;recipe&#039; found in the home of Mr Jones is one for poison which he is using in the factory either top vejnt his unhapiness at the closing down of the facory

'1','3865','What are some examples of futility?'
'1','3856','The one thing that bugs me is that officers who work in an office on days with the same length of service are getting paid the same as officers working 3 shifts. We have are rest days cancelled etc etc and have to just get on with the disruption it causes and all for no extra pay. Basically work shifts get compensated for it!'

I also have friends who do not work shifts so having a social life can be difficult. It can be a real pain having to take annual leave just to goto a party or wedding etc'
'1','3855','I know I go into work feeling low almost all of the time
'1','3853','The only resource I am aware of is the OHU. As my earlier answer already states

'1','3856','Again the shifts can get in the way. I have chosen not to take on certain roles within the department because i will not let the job effect my private/personal life anymore than it does. I am not considering going for promotion as it requires me to devote an unexceptional amount of time to study and prepare at home. Although i believe that i could cope with the role of a supervisor i don&#039;t think the pay reflects the responsibilty'

'1','3855','My home life is interferred with greatly because of the job
'2','3874','What are your recommendations for improvement?'
'1','3859','lack of direction.'
'1','3855','Night shifts.  Working Solo on nights and lack of sleep can have an adverse effect on health.  It is very difficult to function to any degree when working alone on nights
'1','3885','testing'
'1','3881','1. leadership that actually know what job we really do.<br />2. allow the staff to be self driven rather than treated as children and told what to do in every minute of the working day.<br />3. stand up to the rest of the force and say no occasionally instead of dumping more work on the department.<br />4. stand up to the control rooms about our deployment guide.<br />5. have decent office space and equipment to do the job with.'
'1','3884','In what ways would you involve superiors in the day to day workings and duties of an officer?'
'1','3879','Regarding the restructure/reorganisation of the department :-<br />too much gossip and hearsay was passed to the staff by bosses. This resulted in misinformation and rumours. At the early stages discussions should have remianed confidential and information passed to the staff when ALL the bosse were in agreement in direction or course of action.'
'1','3885','Who do you want to implement these improvements? (i.e.
'1','3881','no superiors............just higher rank!!!'

'1','3881','our bosses..........not leave it to us over the radio!'
'1','3879','We have no superiors just people who bothered to take the exam!'
'1','3885','Would you like to see any stress reducing resources/facilities available other than OHU? Please specify. How would you ensure people actually used them?'
'1','3880','1. realistic goals and objectives with rewards for achieving them.<br />2. strong leadership not people who think they are strong leaders.<br />3. better work environment not litte broom cupboard at the end of corridor. areas to relax away from stress of work. the use of a gym in work time to help relax.<br />4. equiptment to do the work
'1','3879','Realistic and worthwhile goals instaed of ridiculous performance indicators where an arrest that takes you several hours to deal with a disqualified driver or a drink driving offence is counted the same as a &pound;30 fixed penalty for No Seatbelt !!!!'
'1','3878','Provide Cheif Inspector Shakeshaft with an Exit Stratergy from the department.  As he has threatened others with in the past.<br />Employ a boss who actually knows and understands what we do and the preasures placed upon us dealing with death all the time.<br />The staff in the traffic department are amongst the most professional in the force

As the numbers of fatalities continue to escalate it looks more and more likely that terrrorists are behind this attack.

'1','4044','Three days off after nights!!!'
'1','4028','The most important performance indicator we should have in a firearms dept. is the number of incidents we attend and deal with as ARV&#039;s

'1','4030','The gym
'1','4043','Occupational Health
'1','4033','The OHU welfare team are there to be used.I tend to go to my family or close friends who are not in the job. The gym is also a good way of destressing.'
'1','4029','I have personal experience of the support system. I have found it largley based on &#039;how soon can you get back to work&#039; rather than&#039; whats gone wrong and how can we help fix it&#039;. It looks ok on paper

'1','4035','Moaning and ranting and talking about how it was in my last Force
'1','4044','People within Firearms are most definatley far to self opinionated this can sometimes be stressful however its good to listen to how others may deal with an incident as long as they are prepared to accept their way is not the only way.'
'1','4028','Moan

'1','4038','what constitutes a wrong decision?  Personal consequences etc...'
'1','4030','That it is your own decision based on your own moral standing and knowledge of the law.  You will not be supported in anyway by the Police

'1','4033','You are never going to reduce stress at work.Even if you could people would bring their out of work problems into work and thus feel stressed at work. Ideally people should be made to feel worthwhile at work.  If issues out of work are causing you stress then the organisation should offer support and importantly give you compassionate time off work
'1','4043','Support from ACPO ranks especially when it comes to reports in the press. ACPO should be standing up and speaking out in support of officers instead of taking a position on the fence and being too worried about political fall out from their comments.'

'1','4062','what exactly is a boost and what makes it nice?'
'1','4056','don&#039;t like nuts'
'1','4071','thats mingin!'
'1','4058','It&#039;s a rip-off... it&#039;s filled with bubbles!'
'1','4065','fruit and nut??<br />No....plain'
'1','4057','i don&#039;t like dark chocolate'
'1','4066','i think it sux'
'1','4059','I dont like nuts :-)'
'1','4060','too american!!'
'1','4061','what even is this??'
'1','4054','I totally disagree
'1','4053','too bitter!'
'1','4066','more orientation... i did get it'
'1','4064','I expected a lot more supervision.  No these expectations were anything but met'
'1','4065','I expected the course as advertised to be a full-time intensive course- not 2days a week.'
'1','4063','the proffesional study of &quot;criminal profiling&quot;<br />On the web'
'1','4061','its not quite what i expected. The content and the way it was taught was less involved than undergrad. We were not given as much help as i thought we would. In reflection im a little disappointed.'
'1','4065','I expected a lot more &#039;teaching&#039; would be involved since it is a &#039;taught&#039; msc'
'1','4065','i expected contact with ongoing investigations as advertised'
'1','4073','I expected to study the criminal mind and how to become a competent researcher and investigative psychologist.  I do think that my expectations were met and i am now able to conduct research using new  statitical techniques.'
'1','4054','I expected the course to be full time in terms of taught material. I think it has been almost completely independant study in which I am happy to do but I think content wise
'1','4066','I was expecting more assistance
'1','4061','i was thinking of learning from the boss and being taught to become more expert in the area
'1','4065','i expected a lot more supervision than we received to help guide us'
'1','4065','i expected a more supportive framework'
'1','4056','that it would be well organized and that the students would  be offered support by the staff. this has proved not to be the case it is highly disorganized and i feel that there is difficult to get a member of staff to answer queries.'
'1','4054','I expected there to be alot more supervision.'
'1','4066','more orientation... and i did not get it'
'1','4069','understanding real investigation and academic
'1','4060','I expected to get more input from staff in the early stages of writing reports. This was not adhered to and I felt like we were putting staff out by asking for help.<br />I did enjoy all subject areas covered on the course but would have liked more depth to each.'
'1','4057','I expected the course to be full time involving quite a lot of teaching and group work. I expected within these teaching sessions to meet with staff who would provide advice and facilitate open discussion would take place. not all of this was met'
'1','4053','I did not expect to be spoon-fed in terms of tuition received
'1','4058','I expected a more in-depth look into specific aspects of Investigative Psychology and their practical applications. Unfortunately
'1','4052','originally i expected i would learn how to make profiling of serial offenders<br />but
'1','4059','I expected to be given a free-ish reign in relation to the subjects I could consider for each of my assignments. Yet the topics that I was interested in
'1','4062','I expected this course to give me a clear
'1','4053','me niether'
'1','4073','Although i don&#039;t feel that we had enough teaching or supervision.'
'1','4066','i did not'
'1','4065','i agree'
'1','4058','Sadly I felt that orientation was the one thing that this course lacked the most.'
'1','4065','contact with real ongoing investigations would have been extremely helpful!'
'1','4066','i dont think i would handle 5 times a week
'1','4053','I fully agree with that. Infact I really cannot understand why this course is the most expensive MSc to do considering how little we have been in and the lack of supervision'
'1','4056','i don t think that students can expected to be privvy to ongoing police investigations'
'1','4062','I absolutely agree with this....I feel as though previous years were able to get more from this course than we were'
'1','4060','Completely agreed!!'
'1','4057','i totally agree'
'1','4059','I agree
'1','4069','i expected a more supervison too.'
'1','4066','ME TOO...'
'1','4054','I think it has been useful to carry out research on our own and do feel I am a little better at conducting reserach although
'1','4073','i thought that we might have found out about investigations that the department are currently working on and how they go about it.'
'1','4058','If the two days had been approached more effectively then it would have been a great course with the additional days to research.'
'1','4052','it looks like everybody expected the same'
'1','4065','The course should be much better organised'
'1','4061','much more interaction with the staff'
'1','4065','...and much better structured'
'1','4065','supervisors should be allocated for each assignment'
'1','4058','Lecturers who enjoy teaching
'1','4061','being told its ok to appraoch staff for help - learning more about their individual areas of work.'
'1','4054','Definately supervision throughout assignmnents. It is very stressful to conduct research if you lack experience. I think many people would benefit from a supervisors input'
'1','4064','An improvement would be to allocate all the msc students with a supervisor.'
'1','4065','e-mails and coursework should be returned asap'
'1','4057','I would recommend that the course involved more teaching sessions and supervision to make people feel they are getting what they came for'
'1','4056','each student should be allocated a supervisor at the beginning of the course 
'1','4062','More class time
'1','4069','more supervison and more activity works can be improve the course.'
'1','4053','More input from staff
'1','4065','there should be alot more teaching involved'
'1','4064','More organization of the case in terms of assignments and supervisors'
'1','4056','course should be better organized too many timetable changes cause problems'
'1','4073','It would be improved with more teaching time.  Easier access to lecturers to help with statistics and projects.  Finding out what the department is doing at the moment - how does investigative psychology help organisations??'
'1','4052','introducing a more real case to our class would be desirable<br />but
'1','4065','the prospectus should reflect the actual content of the course'
'1','4058','A more encouraging and engaging attitude from lectures in regard to specific subjects or topics tackled by the students
'1','4063','I recommend that the assignment feedbacks have to be given more quicqly'
'1','4060','To have supervisors for all assignments. More guidance with regards to what areas to research in preparation for exams.'
'1','4069','more interaction to academic and real investigation'
'1','4073','A lot more help with statistics!'
'1','4066','- Available staff to help us<br />- Shouldnt have a hard time gaining data<br />- sticking to ONE timetable and not changing constantly thorough the year<br />- Better teaching of stats/research methods classes (i.e. indipendant small assignments to do at home where we get marked on)<br />- We were too time pressured first 2 weeks of uni.'
'1','4053','I think there were too many people enrolled on the course this year- prevented any real chance of one to one interaction'
'1','4059','More contact with the department in the form of more classes
'1','4059','More supervision and guidance in relation to assignments. It turned out the the Critical Incident department were far more helpful and far more approachable &amp; willing to help.'
'1','4073','coursework to be returned quicker'
'1','4052','more supervision is necessary'
'1','4066','i totally agree'
'1','4053','I disagree with this. In my opinion
'1','4073','More knowlege about what data is available'
'1','4056','the feedback on the assignments  should be legible'
'1','4057','supervisors should be given from the start who can provide advice and assistance from the beginning on areas that each student is interested in researching'
'1','4062','The prompt return of assignments is definately lacking
'1','4052','especially for foreign students<br />is it too much expectation?'
'1','4058','If the two days were used more effectively the amount of days should not matter.  The other days should be there to go in more depth with subjects at hand.'
'1','4060','While there are a few staff I have contacted that are very good at replying to emails
'1','4063','In order to improve this
'1','4066','we should have this feedback during the all the course'
'1','4059','Definitely
'1','4061','there definately hasnt been enough encouragement - it actually feels like weve been put down and put off - especailly applying for PhDs.'
'1','4073','more teaching time for the money and being taught by Professor Canter more'
'1','4059','I agree
'1','4066','although given supervisor for 4th assignment some did not benefit as much as others'
'1','4057','yes but two days is not full time and more areas of use could be covered throughout a whole weeks teaching'
'1','4061','it would be better if we could perhaps choose to work with different people through the assignment to learn from each of the supervisor'
'1','4065','i definitely agree with this - not much help or support offered for finding funding'
'1','4053','Yes I agree
'1','4056','members of staff should endeavour to answer emails promptly or at all
'1','4069','yes i agree'
'1','4066','we should trade with more respect sometimes if we make some mistakes'
'1','4059','A lot of us had emails ignored by some of the IP department. This does not help or encourage us to perservere with the course'
'1','4052','exactly
'1','4057','i agree there more teaching is needed to have a deeper understanding of the topics covered'
'1','4062','While statistics may not have been many students strong points
'1','4063','There is much difference between people who have studyed statistc before this course and not'
'1','4059','I agree
'1','4073','more indepth feedback on assignments'
'1','4057','yes i think this would be of great use and students could get involved in current research projects'
'1','4066','I agree
'1','4053','The first 2 weeks consisted mainly presentations. That is fine and I can see why this was done. But there wasn&#039;t enough feedback/ tuition after each presentation. We wree just told that some of them weren&#039;t good enough. Future years could benefit from more encouragement/criticism.'
'1','4065','it seems to be that a student will do much better if he/she gets in with the right lecturer. This is not giving everyone the same opportunity to progress as it is merely down to chance'
'1','4066','better corrections in the assignments'
'1','4073','Be able to meet the person who marked assignment to discuss faults'
'1','4054','I think the stats classes on a wednesday should be more constructed around statistical procedures that we are likely to use. Alot of the advanced methods with Stacey this year have not been used for peoples assignmnents. Only logistic regression. It may be more useful to realise specifically in what context we could use them rather than just learning the technique'
'1','4059','I think the second semester statistics classes were covered a lot better &amp; in more detail. They were also broken down into more digestable chunks
'1','4052','real intestigation is mostly involved with a lot complicated things and most cases are solved simply by something else other than what we learned here<br />yesterday
'1','4060','Totally
'1','4056','after an initial burst of enthusiasm at the beginning the programme director appeared to disappear and take no further part in the course
'1','4059','Definitely
'1','4065','- it advertised contact with ongoing investigations which we did not really have'
'1','4057','the prospectus made me feel as if i would in uni full time being taught and participating in research projects in groups not just independently. I think it needs to be clear most work is research on your own'
'1','4066','I think we are pretty mature enough to come to lectures whenever we want. We should not sign a papet of attendance. I mean
'1','4063','yes
'1','4054','I think it would be useful to see the context in which we could use stats methods rather than just learning the technique and just learning to run them through spss'
'1','4052','yes
'1','4060','I agree and it&#039;s a shame that the view is that they are not directly related to IP.'
'1','4066','I think we are pretty mature enough to come to lectures whenever we want. We should not sign a papet of attendance. I mean
'1','4073','Haven&#039;t seem him since last semester'
'1','4061','at least not always being refer: go to read this article or this book'
'1','4053','Perhaps not more teaching from him
'1','4056','the stats classes should be taught in smaller groups this would help teaching'
'1','4059','Yes I feel like we&#039;ve been guinea pigs as we&#039;ve found out that previous years students received a completely different format of teaching &amp; guidance'
'1','4058','The problem is that allowing 20 people on the course and then taking an approach of little supervision and no guidance
'1','4066','canter'
'1','4073','everyone'
'1','4066','canter'
'1','4054','I disagree
'1','4066','canter'
'1','4065','more forensic psychology teaching content would be relevant to prepare us for future jobs. I know it is not a &#039;forensic psychology&#039; course bu more knowledge about the wider field would be useful'
'1','4066','david'
'1','4052','yea
'1','4073','it would be really interesting to find out the type of work that Professor canter is working on when we don&#039;t see him to help us get some idea for the future'
'1','4065','extremely expensive course and not value for money... see all other points'
'1','4060','In particular Prof Canter. It would be an idea if staff could make it clear when they won&#039;t be around for long periods of time including PhD students so we know not to expect any emails back.'
'1','4061','the department seems very split - IP and the critical incident department do not seem to get on and this can put people off talking to lecs on &#039;the other side&#039; depending on who their supervisor is.'
'1','4053','The need to sign a register should not be enforced- we are mature adults paying for the course- surely it is up to us whether we attend or not? We are mature enough to realsie how important it is to attend so if we dont

'1','4065','all three were good speakers
'1','4056','kevin was entertaining and his talk may be useful regarding a career'
'1','4057','The task was entertaining and gave us an idea of what managing an incident would be like'
'1','4064','Simon Duff Clinical aspects of his area and dry sense of humour kept it humorous'
'1','4061','he mixed theory with practise ang gave us real examples that we will be able to use later'

'1','4065','Simon duff was also very good - injected a lot of humour into his teaching'
'1','4058','AMEN'
'1','4054','Totally disagree.'
'1','4056','rupert used his examples from his police career which made the lecture interesting'
'1','4062','Robbie pushed us to think outside the box and help us to see the difficulties in extreme scenarios that police may have to deal with'
'1','4053','Stuart Kirby was a good example of how Investigative Psychology can be used in the police- a career I very much want to take part in<br />The same can be said for Alan Kirby'
'1','4053','Dont waste me time'
'1','4064','Kate Whitfield-gave a good informed lecture and opened my eyes up to the other side of Critical Incidents as I was thinking about not turning up to that lecture but glad I did.'
'1','4052','but it would be better if he used some photos'
'1','4063','me neither'
'1','4073','1. rupert heritage was the most informative about how to use investigative psychology to help investigations.  How the anlayses that we have learnt can be used to help investigations.<br />2. Albert Kirkby gave a really good insight into police investigations.  Helps wanna be police officers.<br />3.  HYDRA is really interesting and it was presented really well - opens an area that can be helped with IP'

'1','4114','i like chocolate digestives as they are filling and extremely tasty to boot'

'1','4112','horrible'
'1','4117','I think I know who wrote that too.   They are really great with Stilton or Cheddar'
'1','4112','naughty'
'1','4117','Too hard - break your teeth so should be be banned'
'1','4117','Health advantages too but too much sugar - black and satin is really healthy'
'1','4111','Advanced pyschometrics reversed.'
'1','4117','Why on earth in bed - surely other things happen there?'
'1','4110','A degree!'
'1','4117','learned a lot about the locals who are talented
'1','4115','I found good people and some bad ones also but the good ones were more than the bad ones'
'1','4110','And a job and a ruined liver'
'1','4116','I gained a degree  and a career'
'1','4117','What is a degree?'
'1','4112','friends for life
'1','4117','But Cains is really great and deserves to be better know'
'1','4112','locals are talented?'
'1','4118','professional degree and education to face the real life'
'1','4117','Great place for culture
'1','4112','i thought they used mersey river water to make the beer'
'1','4115','I gained a degree and also the real taste of UK'
'1','4116','and some good friends that crop up as time goes by.'
'1','4114','It was great to meet people from all over the shop and not just from my home town'
'1','4112','too expensive'
'1','4111','Like drinking Coco and reading?'
'1','4117','yes - but is it professional or just a basic degree needing a further qualification?'
'1','4110','Cains is wrong.  My poison was always snakebite.  Or gin'
'1','4112','that piece of paper you get at the end of 3 years of suffering!'
'1','4117','Cheap packages - do want a deal?'
'1','4115','Yes this is what happened to me also I went into real life the hard one'
'1','4118','what was your subject of education'
'1','4110','I was in the Kop on Tuesday!'
'1','4117','Exactly what a campus experiemce is all about.  Thiose who live off site miss all this'
'1','4114','what all locals are scallies?'
'1','4113','i am still involved with the university through alumni meetings and also philosophy meetings as well as the career department.'
'1','4111','a degri in anglesh.'
'1','4118','in which field please'
'1','4117','Luck you.  I was on Queens Drive at 7.30 and its was just like the old days - deserted except for Evertonians!'
'1','4112','shouldn&#039;t we have more practical experience though instead of just theory?'
'1','4116','And a football team too'
'1','4117','FAC Tell us more about the degree'
'1','4110','I was bit disappointed with the actual degree certificate - was expecting a proper scroll with a wax seal!  Was just A4 piece of paper in plastic thingy'
'1','4118','what do you mean bad ones'
'1','4111','I&#039;ll drink most things other than vodka'

'1','4117','Of course they are!'
'1','4112','it&#039;s pretty good! i wish there was more practical experience though instead of just theory!'
'1','4116','Hard to keep in touch with them later?'
'1','4117','Yes - and a bad health record too.  Never seen so much smoking before I came here'
'1','4115','chemistry'
'1','4111','I agree I had to travel in and it was only when I stayed over at friends that I could see and expoerience the fun.'
'1','4118','what is easy to get the job you want and how long it took you'
'1','4114','sports and dramatic arts participation opportunities were many and I took full advantage of them'
'1','4117','No - that is something the University could do better for us'
'1','4113','I have had the opportunity to meet very different  people from a very varied background. I have increased my knowledge tremendously.'
'1','4112','i&#039;d agree completly! and i&#039;d also encourage anyone who is thinking of coming to university to stay in university halls'
'1','4115','well scousers are good people'
'1','4110','I agree with that
'1','4117','And tesco is building a new all weather pitch!  Great news for the current undergraduates'
'1','4114','Ken Dodd?'
'1','4116','psychology and PGCE'
'1','4112','business economics'
'1','4115','well the ones who attack you during night and who use drugs'
'1','4114','I hope they take out the Mersey Trout first'
'1','4117','Yes - and also try to meet people on all ranges of course where ever possible.  May be more difficult for those on health course as they do have very much longer hours as I seem to recall.  Is this still true?'
'1','4111','and onion yummy!!'
'1','4115','what shop was it'
'1','4117','Bath Olivers'
'1','4117','Very as I am working here full time'
'1','4111','It was what Cromwells mum would shout
'1','4110','vodka is fantastic
'1','4112','it&#039;s not going to happen!!! there is a councillor who has put forward an objection to the council! and it could mean that wyncoat will be public land so the uni wont be able to use it!'
'1','4114','no but I will be there in spirit.  We will have won it 6 times'
'1','4116','totally agree I did not and you have to work hard to fill the gap'
'1','4117','Tell me more about philosophy meetings?'
'1','4112','asda!'
'1','4110','no
'1','4117','Alumni organisation is very behn other Unievrsities and has a lot  of catching up to do'
'1','4111','No
'1','4112','i think there could be even a sort of graduates forum on the uni website!'
'1','4115','well it is ok but not bad not good'
'1','4119','FAC Can you give details of the particular events that have helped you to do this?'
'1','4118','I am still associate member of the university
'1','4117','Still involved working within a subject based alumnus organisation - but we lack ways of increasing membership easily'
'1','4114','exactly.  Much easier now with email and what have you.  When I was there it was telephone
'1','4116','I dont have much contact with this alumni but do get mail from them and have had phone calls from students who ask for money.'
'1','4112','obviously spelling wasn&#039;t a module!'
'1','4111','The above comment is a little generalistic
'1','4115','I know who you are'
'1','4118','please explain further and why not bad not good'
'1','4112','love it!'
'1','4120','Travel discounts sound interesting!'
'1','4114','it will be nice if Tesco dont get it as they have paid for the upgrade of all the grass pitches.  Sir Terry&#039;s a scouser anyway he will be generous I am sure'
'1','4110','excellent idea.  I think the University are better at keeping in touch with older graduate contingent but more work needed to tap into younger years.  Web communications like a forum would be best but needs widepsread marketing'
'1','4111','No they aren&#039;t. Many famous and worthwhile people have come from &#039;The pool&#039; and not all of them are overpaid ball kickers.'
'1','4112','i think that there should be some kind of &#039;ultimate&#039; alumni card.. which includes entrance to libraries
'1','4110','or morse code'
'1','4111','Are Mersey trout long
'1','4120','They could but it should be focussed on the alumni related student and &#039;Faculty&#039; related areas.   If money was raised
'1','4115','yes experience during study is important beacuse when you go to work they want you to be experienced before hand'
'1','4120','And other cutlure activites on and off campus?'
'1','4112','i think not! we&#039;ve already think we paid enough and now we also have to contribute financially to the university!!'
'1','4120','yes - its OK'
'1','4110','Scousers are the friendliest race in world. Fact'
'1','4120','The weather'
'1','4120','Alumni wine cellar'
'1','4112','i like it and it seems to be updated regularly... we need an online shop though!!'
'1','4110','Biscuits'
'1','4112','i defo think we should have some kind of &#039;just graduated&#039; discounts nationally! maybe link in with NUS discounts?'
'1','4115','what you mean in bed you mean x'
'1','4112','smoke signals!'
'1','4120','In my area
'1','4123','i think that the degree I gained has been an invaluable tool in enabling me to have lived the life I have and I am delighted that I was 20 when I got it!  It was the last studying that I have had to do in earnest'
'1','4110','One of the best ideas already in existence is the lifetime Guild membership.  None of my uni mates know about that and I think that would be a great incentive for the young &#039;uns to come up here for a reunion - TIme Tunnel reunion!'
'1','4115','why biscuits'
'1','4124','Enjoying life and meeting people
'1','4120','Little exeprience so far as am actually not a graduate of this institution but havebeen working here for some time'
'1','4110','Discount LFC season tickets'
'1','4125','I know you get a magasine and offers to give money to the uni over the phone. also I have been offer to have a credit card'
'1','4124','Where is it?'
'1','4110','Why not'
'1','4113','I know about the range of services offered and I endeavour to attend all the events that we are informed about through<br />e-mails received from Emma Smith. The  last event in the evening was interesting
'1','4120','Free buscuits?'
'1','4120','What was the venue so I can avoid it'
'1','4124','It&#039;s how the cookie crumbles!'
'1','4112','the guild officers dinner has definatly helped me to understand the past experience of ex-students here!'
'1','4120','No more credit cards - already have a drawer full of them!'
'1','4112','definatly!'
'1','4124','This is like leaving Feedback on Ebay!'
'1','4122','test'
'1','4115','well I think doing some thing new in life is all I need'
'1','4123','you will recognise one when you see them'
'1','4122','sport
'1','4120','More useful whould be something which perhaps gives you worthwhile benefits for Liverpool based activities which are nation/internal?  There is a hugh captive market here of graduates and soemone might explore opportunity to benefit and grow business?'
'1','4112','sorry to break it to you.. time tunnel is gone!'
'1','4125','I have a card from another Uni and am offered interesting things like a lecture followed by a meal etc. I have also been offered a good deal on health care through Manchester Uni alumni. (Not good enough though)'
'1','4120','More use of Web2 perhaps?'
'1','4123','what did UK taste of?'
'1','4110','There&#039;s various graduate benefit schemes run in banks
'1','4115','well it is more colorfull then ever'
'1','4112','my family
'1','4120','I didn&#039;t know there was one?  I would also like to know where it is?'
'1','4112','we need an online shop!! maybe linking in to the one the guild has?'
'1','4124','Like this?'
'1','4120','How about a Cains Liverpool University special brew?'
'1','4122','was it in the student union or with overseas student center'
'1','4110','I know.  Along with my life - I spent every Saturday there throughout final year - should&#039;ve been working but was worth the measly 2:2'
'1','4115','come on you foot ball lover'
'1','4112','blue and blue!'
'1','4112','maybe the university is tory?'
'1','4120','because we all seem to llike them - and they are wonderful icebrakers'
'1','4110','Someone&#039;s got shares in Cains here!'
'1','4125','agree it would be good to be able to keep up with the real developments in science and so forth and have lectures at the cutting edge for alumni and friends.'
'1','4123','you were lucky to get the plastic thingy
'1','4120','Liverpool si a great place with a tarnished reputation.   I want to change this - we have a wonderful waterfront
'1','4110','and dunking ginger nuts in tea is highly therapeutic'
'1','4120','Up the reds!'
'1','4112','20??????? were you super clever?'
'1','4115','yes like this waht we are doing now we should not stop anywhere'
'1','4112','20??????? were you super clever?'
'1','4112','tasty!'
'1','4122','the research and technology news about various project and  its industrial applications'
'1','4120','Of course it is - anything to rid us otf the current dishonest lot.  Hope they get a drumming today and klet the yellows in....<br />Long life Bannockburn..'
'1','4110','I don&#039;t think the city has a tarnished reputation
'1','4115','yes liverpool is lovely place to live'
'1','4125','It would also be useful to have a reintroduction to the library at some point and A PASS TO PARK for alumni perhaps in the holidays so that they would be encouraged to get used to using the facilities.'
'1','4112','ha ha ha'
'1','4120','One could contribute reflections on life here today.'
'1','4112','brilliant ebayer!! a'
'1','4110','I&#039;ve got share in Absolut'
'1','4120','Could you reissue the old postcards produce in the 1920s as an appeal?'
'1','4113','I feel that alumni should not have to provide financial support for the university.<br />The onus for financial support for higher education should be on the government.<br />I think that if and only if the alumni feel that they want to contribute to the university out of loyalty
'1','4123','no just someone who did enough work to get through the exams first time
'1','4120','Mines in M and B'
'1','4112','yea true
'1','4115','yes you must be an agen in Cains'
'1','4120','Got any maps for sale?'
'1','4112','depends where you live though!'
'1','4110','What&#039;s M and B?  Do you mean mnms?!'
'1','4126','I agree communication is important. It is what keeps us from fighting each other.'
'1','4120','Real ales - long live CAMPRA'
'1','4110','or Mills and Boon novels!'
'1','4112','how random.. i think someone clicked on the wrong link!'
'1','4120','perhaps we&#039;d be better with a shareholding?'
'1','4112','isn&#039;t it sunny today?'
'1','4122','I have an associate card as well but it does not let me access the copmuter- CSD - facilities
'1','4110','More insider info - the University is launching an online shop for gifts and memorabilia'
'1','4112','biscuit production'
'1','4120','No many have any idea - and see it as something for &#039;toffs&#039;'
'1','4110','Btw
'1','4120','Hope the new Conference centre is a success.  Can we visit it?'
'1','4126','Liverpool for many years was a corrupt BLack Hole that used to suck public funding. I hope 2008 cures this.'
'1','4112','nope.. scouse studies!'
'1','4115','yes you can reflect on your life anywhere and with any one'
'1','4112','yea but those deny they are from liverpool... its quite sad really!'
'1','4120','Friends of Williams Tunnels then?  Anyone been there?'
'1','4123','agree with this.  I kept my student unon card for a while after I left to access the sports faciliites cheaper.  It would be great to have some kind of &quot;LIVERPOOL UNI PASSPORT&quot; which I could hold with pride (as a kind of business card of you like) but could also offer benefits of discounts on things'
'1','4120','Automatic Virgin Travel Club - they charge enough!'
'1','4112','not the ones from toxteth of bootle!'
'1','4115','well we will see waht they do with the money'
'1','4126','Got to get
'1','4127','there is a website called &#039;a cup of tea and a nice sit down&#039; that is devoted to biscuits and which ones are best for dunking and so on.'
'1','4112','brilliant! congratulations :)'
'1','4120','Actually
'1','4110','Alumni page should be more prominent on web
'1','4120','Free car parking for alumni please'
'1','4115','yes but they are very different from all of UK'
'1','4125','I  would have felt in the past that to give money to the uni that I gained so much from would have been ok as |I came through on a grant in the years that I did not have to pay. But now I am haveing to pay for my kids at uni I do not feel able to find extra money for a system I am paying into and I do not feel that they will feel beholden either as they will carry so much debt. The position of government funding to self funding changes public perception aas a place to give money .'
'1','4120','And free dental care in dental hosptial at any time'
'1','4126','There are mouse mats on Ebay.'
'1','4115','well Liverpool is not expensive as London'
'1','4120','Not sure Lord Brown would like that one!'
'1','4122','I would like alumni to  support and subsidised events for its members to participate in various development programmes.'
'1','4123','I know that there are events held now and again in lIVERPOOL AND (oops) elsewhere and there has recentley been a series of guest lectures.  Alumni stuff is covered in Insight
'1','4120','Nope - they are red and blue'
'1','4120','Tarts'
'1','4113','I have looked at the alumni website. I prefer hardcopies. I like the insight magazine
'1','4115','well is very hard to find money for study we should have a free education policy for all who are talented and dynamic'
'1','4110','I think there should be more focug groups
'1','4126','More tory than that silly tree-hugger Cameron.'
'1','4120','I love real black pudding.  What is Liverpool able to offer as a unique taste other than Scouse?'
'1','4122','for financial contribution within reasonable amount will be ok'
'1','4125','Never have done - not aware of it but perhaps today is a good introduction'
'1','4110','I&#039;ll second that
'1','4115','well I have traced you who you are who want a permit'
'1','4123','wasnt it alma de cuba?  hardly call that seedy!'
'1','4120','Here is something the University could well develop to make it worth while.  A piece of paper is pretty boreing.  lets think laterall and give everyone a woven cloth degree award!'
'1','4123','what is wEB2?'
'1','4120','Brewing'
'1','4115','yes they should'
'1','4120','Where can I buy them?'
'1','4123','agree with this.  People tend to be very parochial and to have a very closeted view and stick to what they know and studied.'
'1','4110','Utter rubbish
'1','4115','well you have done good job you have put the world in words'
'1','4112','i hope it isn&#039;t!!! it&#039;ll mean that the university wont get all the big gigs anymore... instead people will have to go to the docks!!'
'1','4110','Better than the Wirral anyway
'1','4112','how come?'
'1','4120','Yes - every tried saying something to anyone on the Undeground?  Thye look at you as if you&#039;re from Mars!!'
'1','4112','they can&#039;t... they are tied in to the contract with In the Zoo until 2009 - insider info!'
'1','4120','Trip on the Ship Canal?'
'1','4120','Fishing for salmon in mersey'
'1','4122','to get alumni office organise  wide ranging events  including visits to industrial/ educational establishment here in the uk 
'1','4120','Why not New Year Cards instead?'
'1','4112','only for biscuits!'
'1','4110','The Guild need to sort out their marketing strategy to draw in bigger names to compete with the Arena.  Shouldn&#039;t really compare as different type of venue altogether'
'1','4125','brilliant idea though. If you attend a paid for  alumni lecture you could have a parking space on a saturday in December.'
'1','4115','yes it removes all the missunderstandings betweenn all cultures and clash of civilizations.'
'1','4112','we can give alumni free peg legs instead...'
'1','4120','What is time tunnel?'
'1','4113','I thought that knowledge was power  - the best things in life are free. Selfishness and greed are unwarranted.<br />However
'1','4122','I would like to see on line booking/ reservations for events'
'1','4126','Some of them are good. I particularly like the Houses Of Parliament trip last year.<br />There is a Tower Bridge walk this year.'
'1','4120','Hope so - he is an idiot!'
'1','4120','Agree - these &#039;chat rooms&#039; are developing fast these days.'
'1','4110','Hi Emma!'
'1','4126','Insight is quarterly.'
'1','4120','Can the site get prominence from internal web pages in each Faculty?'
'1','4113','EDUCATION<br />EDUCATION<br />EDUCATION<br />HEALTH<br />HEALTH<br />HEALTH<br />WEALTH<br />WEALTH<br />WEALTH'
'1','4120','Maybe Erasmus tie up?'
'1','4110','Was a night run at the Guild every Saturday
'1','4120','Agree.  One of the big problems that all governemnts seem to overlook is that of disposable income.  With high cost of houseing
'1','4126','How about hiring a private suite for alumni at the MEN arena for a concert?'
'1','4112','remeber who put up taxes!'
'1','4120','Tax allowable benefit like gift aid perhpas?'
'1','4110','John Arne Riise'
'1','4122','It will be good idea for the alumni office to liaise with other professional institutes and organisation( I.Mech.E/ IET)  to co-ordinate and organise events for their members.'
'1','4120','Are they a Charity?'
'1','4120','WOMEN area too'
'1','4125','I think you could have a huge increase in alumni use of the Uni if you put on thoughful events that disseminated new ideas and state of the art lectures and if you got them accredited so that there could be a simple feedback sheet after each session and people could -over the years get some form of award for keeping up to date generally with technology ond so forth or could have specific lectures from thee group of topics and use one a year to contribute to their CPD. You could have the ALUMNI TEN YEAR AWARD&gt;'
'1','4113','I am really pleased to be involved with the team. It is something interesting to add to my CV. Do you have any employment opportunities?'
'1','4120','WHO??????'
'1','4112','what happens if you&#039;re in between?'
'1','4126','Is that you Tony? I thought you were retiring soon.'

'1','4123','a)why not?given that there are 20
'1','4110','She is in spirit'
'1','4120','Agree - its horses for courses.  Anyway there are several venues here other than Guild such as the Foresight
'1','4122','To improve the CSD- printing/ copying services pay as you go service-'
'1','4120','I wonder what she&#039;ll make of all this!!'
'1','4120','Can we have the really tatty pressy?  Bad taste gift at 50p max in cost...'
'1','4120','Oddbins discount?'
'1','4132','no they are not they should be not'
'1','4110','That we&#039;re biscuit freedloading numpties who want to skive off work'
'1','4130','An endless hangover!'
'2','4135','NEW QUESTION Tell us about your current relationship with the university. (For example

'1','4130','It&#039;s male
'1','4129','Get graduates involved early on by some free events and free gym pass or something. How about an alumni football challenge on one day a year. Turn up and play. Prizes-medals. If you keep people involved they will stay involved. Getting them back later is much harder and you have fewer years left anyway.'
'1','4120','Make mine too.  I luv Cains!'

'1','4110','It&#039;s my birthday today!'
'1','4120','Pizzas for tea witht he VC'
'1','4133','yea they are!'
'1','4129','Whilst avoiding copying may seem right I do not agree. Look for the best that other unis do and make sure Liverpool Grads have that at least. Afterall most people only have one uni so duplication does not matter'
'1','4120','I agree'

'1','4110','Excellent idea
'1','4129','I like the idea of paying a fiver and upgrading your degree to a masters like they do at Oxford/Cambridge-Think its fifty pouds though'
'1','4132','well it says to be professional but it is not'
'1','4120','Agree - there is a need though to explore carefully what outcome we wnat from the exercise.  A sense of belonging yes but actually ahve we really thought about what it is as abeast?'
'1','4136','I think that the idea of the &#039;ultimate&#039; alumni card may cause too much &#039;traffic&#039; for the university
'1','4130','Can&#039;t have candles

'1','4130','Sir
'1','4110','thank you very much'
'1','4133','but hard working geeks!'
'1','4132','yes we should give degrees which would help in future of a person and give him future direction'

'1','4129','your leg'
'1','4132','well in which everyone is involved not just few'
'1','4120','Lifetime awards.  Maybe a free coffin with the crest on it?'
'1','4134','any supporters to this proposal please'
'1','4133','i agree'

'1','4134','I agree'
'1','4110','Spot on'
'1','4132','I dont have car so no worries'
'1','4120','Bring back Mozart then'

'1','4133','maybe for the young graduates
'1','4120','Shanks pony is very good except it costs on footware.  How about university free podiatry/'
'1','4132','well this is good to have free biscuits atleast from the University'
'1','4133','like the one being organised externally in london maybe?'
'1','4137','Please be aware that some might find such comments offensive rather than jokes
'1','4136','Where does the &#039;support&#039; for the University come from anyway? Is it from Sir Alistair Pilkington? More democracy and representation please. I do not have the means to contribute to the University at this point in time. I already support enough &#039;charities&#039;. But it is necessary to build a &#039;base&#039; to run the University.'
'1','4132','web inside a web'
'1','4138','...no I love Emma
'1','4120','We can do simple things about these problems.  You may confide in us all and tell us your problem...'
'1','4110','there&#039;s at least one LARGE exception to that. Insider info'
'1','4133','i think its halls food!! potatoes
'1','4134','you can not upgrade your degree with registration and examination'
'1','4129','I agree that that was the case in the far past cause at first graduates are poor and want stuff from the uni but have nothing to give financially. I was not contacted for years .<br />Once you get to a certain age and might have some free funds then contact again and now this!!!!!!!! intersting. But other unis are also doing this so a growth area for unis looking for funds or things they can turn into funds. For example Manchester \\uni looked through alumni and invited well known ones to speak at major events.'
'1','4120','I agree with this.   Again
'1','4132','well I have gained littile from my stay in the Uni'
'1','4120','Why?  They surely do opffer benefit and can easily argue it would benefit the wider community'
'1','4138','I would say that Liverpool HAD a tarnished reputation.  We seemd to have shed that (at least only the &#039;Boys from the Black Stuff&#039; one remains
'1','4130','Wasn&#039;t me!'
'1','4120','Agree with b as there is real poverty in areas.  Support for Inner City Challenge perhpas?  What are we doing about this as an Institution?  Do Alumni know?'
'1','4132','so you work with tesco'

'1','4138','health
'1','4130','LOL'
'1','4133','maybe for the older generation'
'1','4120','Yes - within my discipline and meetings related to my personal PG development'
'1','4132','Oh you love cains so much why is that'
'1','4136','If new technology is reliable that is fine. If not - then hell might as well break loose.<br />Paper is wasted - but mostly because of mistakes made on the computer. Too much replication takes place. Bring back books. Second thoughts - there are too many books.'
'1','4120','Agree to a point only.    Would this really benefit most who probably don&#039;t live in merseydise?  Can we think around what one could do nationally?'
'1','4134','sorry I meant without not with'
'1','4120','Our own TV programmes with a Mersey feel?'
'1','4120','On-line blog and Wiki?'
'1','4132','are u a cook'

'1','4141','I am now!  I can boil a WHOLE pan of rice!'
'1','4130','The Guild is run mainly by inexperienced students who couldn&#039;t plan their way out of a paper bag. That is why it doesn&#039;t run properly.'
'1','4132','well we should talk then type'
'1','4120','This is cerainly a way forward - blogs and Wikis are very much today along with podcasts.   We do need to watch the future direction on this one.'

'1','4160','Lime Street Station at Rush Hour'
'1','4160','The Tunnels at Rush Hour'
'1','4169','on the platform?'
'1','4159','Kingsway &amp; Queensway Tunnels. Monday Morning rush hour.'
'1','4169','How many? which ones?'
'1','4169','Why K &amp; Q'
'1','4157','liverpool railways systems. (lime st) core business centre.'
'1','4160','Try and derail a full train into the platform'
'1','4159','Mass casualties and transportation gridlock.'
'1','4160','Would we use a vehicle borne IED ?'
'1','4159','John Lennon Airport'
'1','4169','any particular platform? &amp; is the London train but what are the chances of it derailing far enough in?'
'1','4160','A plane would be difficult given the number of police there'
'1','4169','Train links?'
'1','4160','Lime street would be better'
'1','4159','Acces Runway (Airside) cripple aircraft coming into land.'
'1','4169','Does any of this need explosives? what about other mass cas strats?'
'1','4169','Than?'
'1','4159','Suggest targeting one or two stations further eastwards to disrupt possible disater recovery.'
'1','4160','we&#039;d need explosives for sure - best overall effect even if we don&#039;t kill that many people'
'1','4160','yes multiple strikes simultaenously to disrupt the plod'
'1','4159','Blow bridges at the end of the M62.'
'1','4160','could we use the fuel dumps at any of these places instead of explosives'
'1','4172','Evening would be better as would cause the city to grid lock rather than the wirral'
'1','4169','yes - interesting issue of thinking about inetrvening in the recovery system<br />1 - frustrates emergency services and makes them look bad<br />2 - increase casualties - thinking 7/7 here - how much more &#039;effective&#039; if prevent paramedics and local hospital services and other first responders doing their jobs effectively'
'1','4160','could we hit tunnels and lime street at same time to cause maximunm gridlock within liverpool and disrupt casevac'
'1','4160','I think this is crucial as we saw the effect in london and madrid'
'1','4160','could this be easily overcome by re-routing traffic'
'1','4160','what about adding in the underground system'
'1','4159','Take over an approaching ship (vessel)
'1','4169','not likely - already a nightmare to get in and out'
'1','4172','what about when liverpool or everton are having a midweek home game.'
'1','4160','even better if we hit the fuel terminals
'1','4160','A ship full of toxic chemicals would be best
'1','4159','Yes! 4 truck/nail bomb type vehicles
'1','4160','i don&#039;t think it will kill enough people'
'1','4172','both the road and the rail this will then send all the traffic over the bridge.  if that can then be disrupted this will force all the traffic into warrington. to cross the mersey'
'1','4160','depends on what speed it was going at entry'
'1','4157','if possible c4/semtex due to the small quantity required and ease of movement and installation of this plastic. logistics of its use meens alot more damage can be inflicted with relative ease. no doubt &#039;&#039;hme&#039;&#039; would be the other option for an explosive compound.<br />if only a small quantity of explosives are to be used in this attack
'1','4160','how much plastics are we talking about - would it be missed'
'1','4169','TRAINS - WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW (MAPS ETC?)'
'1','4160','timetables'
'1','4160','security cameras'
'1','4160','number of police
'1','4159','Blow up Concorse House Office block. The debris then falls down onto Lime Street Station.'
'1','4169','Do you need locations of local hospitals?'
'1','4160','blocked by traffic confusion outside'
'1','4159','Blow up hospitals.'
'1','4169','timed devices at first responder locations would be very disruptive'
'1','4160','disrupt power system by taking out substations'
'1','4157','these would be long term accociates
'1','4169','4 max'
'1','4160','use dirty bomb to instil panic even if no one dies at scene'
'1','4169','4 at Lime street - not sure elsemwhere'
'1','4160','take out a/e and ambulance station so can&#039;t respond to casaulties'
'1','4172','Liverpool side of the river<br />Fazakerly(Aintree). Liverpool Royal.  Broadgreen<br />Wirral side of the river<br />Arrow Park. Claterbridge'
'1','4160','car bomb in stations car park as obvious rv for emergency vehicles'
'1','4159','Note : TARGET COMMUNICATIONS. BR have huge communication Fibre Nodes running in the Cess
'1','4160','would this take out radio comms - maybe blind cctv'
'1','4169','whic of these would likley be first responder and base for casualties?'
'1','4160','would you have enough for planned multiple strikes - if large amounts of hme needed then we&#039;d quite a few bombers'
'1','4159','Depends if Repeaters or Radio Break out points are used
'1','4172','Fazakerly has a ambulance station next to the hospital.  which houses a few ambulances when not in use.'
'1','4160','take out cctv to hide evidence'
'1','4160','most hospitals have attached ambulance stations - there are also satellite stations like the one by the cains brewery'
'1','4159','Does&#039;nt need to be a &quot;Dirty Bomb&quot;
'1','4169','Are we talking Lime Street as primary target with Kingsway &amp; Quenssway as secondary. Then further disruption at choice hospitals?'
'1','4160','if we took out the central co-ordinating location through explosives or knocking out power then the whole system would crash and the response with it'
'1','4172','Liverpool Royal then Fazakerly(Aintree) for caualties on this side of the river.  Oh I think that there is a burns unit at Wiston of the M62'
'1','4160','any source of radiation at scene would cause widespread long-term panic way out opf proportion to original attack'
'1','4160','there is also hospitals in warrington
'1','4169','Ok  - LIME street looks possible with Royal and Fazakerly hospitlas as secondary targets'
'1','4167','if you do it on a football match day - may be more police about'
'1','4167','but at the same time - more potential casualities'
'1','4160','which trains carry the most people at specific times
'1','4159','Suggest both Lime Street and Tunnels
'1','4160','the more police there are then the more likely that they may prevent the attack - surely we woudl want a time when the plod are off eating or soemthing'
'1','4159','Yeah... lets do it!'
'1','4160','if we hit the station and the nearest hospitals then the disruption to road and rail would prevent proper casevac - not enough choppers. if we add runcorn bridge to the mix then all of the motorways and surroundign roads will knocked out'
'1','4167','police would only be at the station - if you were coming in from some other city by train - maybe less chance of getting caught?'
'1','4157','primarily i would have the actual rail terminal as my target for max. impact during rush hour.<br />this would be followed up with a series of secondary devices
'1','4167','where are the road works happening'
'1','4160','primary target is lime street and secondary targets are the first responders. additional targets include the road conenctions in and around merseyside to disrupt the responders.'
'1','4159','Multiple Petrol Bombs or liquid bombs disguised in 2 ltr soft drinks bottles.'
'1','4160','use next to fuel dump'
'1','4159','Infilrate and locate main water source then....poison.'
'1','4172','what about hydrogen proxide'

Do not approach them to near say about 15 yards. you do not want your officer grabbing them and going over with them. Advise the officer to ask them to come down the stairs with him and to talk there.<br />You need an  intelligence cell or at least one person in charge of intelligence so that you can get some background on them. It would help if we knew who they were and what there were actually upto.<br />You need to cordon the area off and treat this as a critical incident. Inform the duty officer.

On the other hand this may prolong the negotiation and allow us to get a better rapport with them. I advise against giving the water to them where they are but have it here on the roof where they can see it and invite them away from the edge when we will give it to them.

'1','4567','think people may have stressed about placements as this restricted continuing with dissertation plans...as many planned on using the placement to collect data.'

'1','4557','I was left confused as to wether placements were compulsory or not? There seemed to be a clack of clarity with regard to &#039;what if we didnt do a placement&#039; or &#039;were they absolutely essential&#039; ?'
'1','4567','PhD&#039;s at Liverpool??? are they possible?'
'1','4569','we were told that placements should be done to support our dissertation
'1','4553','Identifying a suitable placement was problematic due to lack of a definitive list of opportunities.  Nor was there sufficient description of what was involved in each placement opportunity which was mentioned.  People seemed to feel pressured to undertake a placement despite these being described as optional'
'1','4559','well that i have nothing concrete at the moment and im just touching base with people'
'1','4568','can we get this well prior to the completion of the course?'
'1','4557','but be sure to have a c.v. ready if you want to complete the registration process (they will request this)'
'1','4567','feel like PhDs have been slightly neglected which is suprising when they are many students who have continued their career here'
'1','4560','I think the placement should be made a mandatory aspect of the course as it allows you not gain experience and incite into the practical application of the things we have discussed
'1','4562','is there going to be a doctorate course at liverpool soon?? and if there is would we be able to do this given we have done the masters already??'
'1','4558','...the placement is not part of this year&#039;s course but still (nearly )everyone has one. There are no consequenses for people do not have a placement.It is just a matter of personal benefit...'
'1','4559','i agree discuss??'
'1','4557','there are many books on &#039;how to write dissertations&#039; a comprehensive overview is given in the programme handbook. Plus a million  web addys on the subject'
'1','4554','What careers are available? There seems to be so many possible routes but what routes are opened up with course haven&#039;t been made clear. Only pHDs have really been discussed. Recently I have been panicking that I will come out of this course and actually have been worse off than had I applied for jobs a year ago. The picture that has been painted is bleak.'
'1','4567','i agree. believe it gives insight
'1','4570','do you mean no one that is clinical? Not sure what you mean'
'1','4564','i agree with this as the practical experience is just as if not more important than the academic work we do in uni'
'1','4554','sounds good to me
'1','4569','yes. This was one of the reasons i wanted to do the course in order to gain practical working insight'
'1','4557','why not pro-actively go and look for them? think of your key words and do some forensic investigation!'
'1','4567','lack of guidance who to see and how to tackle when funding for case award has passed'
'1','4565','I wanted to try and talk to other people and ask questions to people outside the course to try and facilitate my dissertation ideas. I am worried about doing this as we were warned against making contact with other people at the beginning of the course. How far can I go with making contact that doesn&#039;t involve asking permission for any potential question or conversation?'
'1','4562','i agree because it gives you alot more idea of the type of job you may actually end up doing'
'1','4564','yep i agree I feel a little lost with everything as all we seem to hear is that there aren&#039;t many jobs around at the minute'
'1','4569','it seems everyone is very investigative and without Kevin Browne
'1','4566','Deffinately
'1','4557','it would make more sense to have the placment worth credits as previous years have done. Especially if they are connected to guest speakers intrests or that of the Department'
'1','4560','the problem was that the deadline for the funding dates was changed and ther department wasnt notified till the last minute
'1','4554','And there was a definite investigative slant. Not everyone is here for the investigative side of the course!!'
'1','4570','Where has the perception of the bleak picture emerged from - can you tell us why you feel this way?'
'1','4563','I feel the same way. A little more guidance and clarity would be beneficial for us career wise. Which routes into different jobs would be best for us to take etc'
'1','4565','But surely there muct be alternative strategies for doing a PhD without this sort of funding because not everyone gets this. I am not entirely sure what they are though.'
'1','4554','yeh this is one of the main reasons I did the course. I thought allocation of placements would be more systematic and there would be greater opportunity.'
'1','4564','this is difficult to do if you are not really sure where to start!'
'1','4558','What is exactly the process of doing a part-time self-funded PhD?Is is just a matter of finding a supervisor and a &quot;good&quot; idea'
'1','4553','It would be useful to have some definitive guidance regarding how much contact time to expect from your supervisor and level of involvement etc.  Also advice about the departmental &#039;rules&#039; about seeking input from other lecturers etc.  More information all round basically'
'1','4562','i agree i think these should be more forensic placements avaliable in future'
'1','4554','what about forensic roles?'
'1','4568','feel like a lot is riding on decisions made now/soon about dissertation topic/method given it counts towards RM module and dissertation. how much leeway will there be to change/adapt it as we go
'1','4566','I have done
'1','4567','something should have been put in palace to inform us of other options as people who were interested in staying at Liverpool are now looking elsewhere as there seems to be lack of options'
'1','4559','but this courses focus was mainly on the investigative side of psychology not the clinical side of forensic psychology as most forensic psychology course are all clinically based.... where as this is an INVESTIGATIVE course'
'1','4569','distinct lack of guidance on chartership. Practically told it woudl be a waste of time for us to do it. The only things i know about it are from speaking to Kevin Browne after class one day'
'1','4557','Is it actually the case that there was a &#039;missed oppertunity&#039; of sorts to do a similar 10kV beofre the Christmas break? this would have highlighted the more problematic areas of concern much sooner on the course continum. Maybe future courses will benefit from this?!'
'1','4564','yes definately!'
'1','4567','best place is to keep an eye on BPS and NHS'
'1','4567','probation?'
'1','4560','There is much emphasis on doing a PhD
'2','4571','General Concerns?'
'1','4570','you just need to come and discuss it with a member of staff and we will gladly help faciliate those discussions'
'1','4567','think redsnapper is another one'
'1','4569','i was under the improseeion this was an investigative AND  forensic psychology course! it is false advertising if this course is designed mainly for investigative and i think if Kevin Browne were still the course director
'1','4562','its also a forensic based course too...or that was the impression i got at my interview...to at least give a more equally balanced side of things'
'1','4564','i agreee with this
'1','4557','the BPS web site is a good starting point
'1','4553','It would be good to hear what students from
'1','4570','The transferable skills you learn on this course will stead you well for any carrear path you choose'
'1','4567','but that is the name of the course
'1','4560','i think it was a real shame to let kevin leave the department
'1','4554','A lot of the guest speakers have given a really great lecture
'1','4565','We do know some of these because some of them have come back to talk to us.'
'1','4566','HMP.gov.uk i think is one that puts up jobs in a forensic setting but again
'1','4554','Application of knowledge? Practical experince is lacking!'
'1','4553','is Liverpool lobbying the BPS/Prison Service to get a chartership trg system similar to the clinical model - if not
'1','4557','I think it is more than just having a good idea. An ability to operationalise a theoretical construct into a more concrete hypotesis is required. Plus the ability to nextwork in the areas you are interested in. What are those areas?'
'1','4558','Will the BPS ever recognise Investigative Psyc. as an established division of psychology with a clear-cut route of accreditation rather than a &quot; long-term project&quot; within the general field of Forensic Psyc.?'
'1','4567','lack of input from some students. i expected this course to communicate their experience and SHARE with the group. only a few people seem to share
'1','4560','nikki grieves!'
'1','4554','we havent been told about the realities of gong down this route
'1','4559','what is the issue involving the status of david canter within the uni and the reasons behind him choosing to set up a course in huddersfeild?? there is too much rumour and id like some facts.... please ;)'
'1','4553','There seem to be some avoidable issues created for students in time management due to sequencing of dissertation ethics superimposed on a course which has already been front loaded this year.'
'1','4565','There seems to be a general lack of interset and support for those students who are more interested in the forensic side of the course.'
'1','4567','does liverpool provide PhD with continuation of Chartership?'
'1','4566','Yes
'1','4560','The course is fantastic for developing theoretical knowledge
'1','4554','I want to get out there and work with people and make a difference. I can&#039;t understand why it&#039;s so hard when I will have this degree and have the enthusiasm to find a job!? I am so disheartened.'
'1','4567','i quite like the fact that the course is front loaded as i am very much looking forward to focusing my time on my dissertation'
'1','4557','As a cohort did we miss the oppertunity to cohesively gel in such a pro-active way that &#039;sharing of imformation&#039; was openly encouraged. Through cohesion could have grown &#039;study groups&#039; for particular areas of intrest. There is still scope to work on this!'
'1','4559','i agree there seems to be the core who choose to participant and that has left the few who do talk feeling the need to be interactive in areas that they might not really fully be interested in just to engage the speaker and give a good impression'
'1','4562','definately i feel there is no interest in those especially who want to become chartered in forensic psychology'
'1','4553','people have different sorts of personalities and there is not a correct level of contribution.  Put differently if some people choose to say little there is more time for those who have a need to say more'
'1','4554','yeh. I have heard that other forensic psych masters courses have been taught how to conduct real risk assessments! We haven&#039;t had anything like this!'
'1','4558','I cannot see how the deadline for the funding of a PhD is related to actually doing one.If you really want to do it you just pay for it!'
'1','4559','i agree we should still explore this we do still have plenty of time'
'1','4560','YOU NEED EXPERIENCE...your attendance on this course is not sufficient to gain employment
'1','4567','i think the lack of forensic experience that was supposed to be mandatory for this course is lacking amongst students which has impacted upon their ability to get involved in discussion-Think the course should stipulate this next year!!'
'1','4564','i feel a lack of support for those who are unsure as to what they want to do after also'
'1','4559','but thats not the case how can you hope to survive in a world where you choose not to interact in..... why be here at all?'
'1','4567','understandable but would be nice to have any contribution'
'1','4565','I agree with this comment. The theoretical ideas have been well established and the course content has been very varied and interesting however the practical side i feel is somewhat lacking (despite the placement as there seem to be a few problems with these).'
'1','4557','practical knowledge can come through your volutary intrests that you have done at both pre-and post graduate level. These are the things that will give you an edge over your peers'
'1','4562','not everyone has something to contribute as at times their questions may have already been answered or asked by some1 else....people should not feel pressured to ask questions if they are not comfortable asking questions'
'1','4568','how shall we go about this? i think it would be useful for at least those doing investigative focused dissertations and those more forensic/clinical maybe to share their ideas within these areas?'
'1','4560','are you joking?may be not
'1','4553','This is perhaps an ideal area for facilitating interaction between IFP and CI courses - ie opportunity to understand each other&#039;s perspectives on the various issues and topics.  Lack of interaction between us and the police seems to have been a major opportunity missed this year'
'1','4554','There isn&#039;t any continuity in the course
'1','4553','The course handbook advertised two or three conferences at Brunswick Dock - we have hear nothing about these so far'
'1','4557','This 10kV should have included a facet of &#039;what worked&#039; or &#039;near misses&#039; to see what the cohort actualy liked about the course!'
'1','4560','i understnad your frustration i am the same too
'1','4557','the oppertunity will be there in the de-brief of this session
'1','4554','definately!!! The course title is investigative and forensic psych
'1','4559','i love everyone'
'1','4557','i totally disagree
'1','4553','didn&#039;t like personal feedback made public in group feedback'
'1','4554','i agree. the course is both. It wouldnt get accredited if it was just investigative. It seems like theres only forensic added just to get the accreditation
'1','4557','are good idea would be for students to give a presentation at the start of the course as to what they have done over the summer (I.e. volunteer work
'1','4559','when?'
'1','4560','definately agree with this statement
'1','4554','bit worried that no one is going to look at drafts
'1','4558','No!'
'1','4567','its not about putting pressure on people to ask q&#039;s but provide insight/thoughts from own experience'
'1','4557','i totally concur with this comment
'1','4565','I disagree
'1','4553','would like to hear directly from police about what contributions from psychologists they would see as benefitting policing in the ideal world (taking no account of budgetary constraints<br />ie what do they really think of our contribution/potential contribution'
'1','4567','think if you want to find out more you can...you got to explore and research yourself'
'1','4567','not sure what you are looking for in a course??? most courses act in this way...you decide where you want to go from here'
'1','4564','ye I am little worried about this too!'
'1','4553','it would have been good to have had a guest speaker who was a psychiatrist for same reasons as it has been outstanding to have input from police visiting speakers'
'1','4554','don&#039;t ever feel valued in this course'
'1','4567','talk to critical incident students-they will help you with this'
'1','4565','I think it&#039;s obvbious who this is but there was a particulat incident involving placements that came as a shock (however much it was my fault)
'1','4562','not every1 has experience in a forensic setting'
'1','4560','very much so..'
'2','4580','What was positive outcome'
'2','4578','Why is Elaine late?'
'2','4576','what do you think of the new face transplant?'
'2','4575','What is your favourite television programme and why?'
'1','4577','so'
'2','4573','What decision will you make at this time and explain your reasons?'
'2','4579','What is Operation Berni?'
'2','4577','Who do you think will win?'

'1','4589','he is dreamy'
'1','4592','I will sit down to see better'
'1','4592','I will have a good think'
'1','4589','the face as well'
'1','4589','how did she survive?'
'1','4594','A new operation'

'1','4624','because i spent this year travelling and drunk'
'1','4623','because 6th form was the best time of my life'
'1','4628','to see how much ive learned over the past few years...'
'1','4634','id make few different decisions; i had a great time at school'
'1','4630','because i would do more things with my life from that time'
'1','4625','because toddlers don&#039;t have any worries'
'1','4632','no one cares if you run around shouting random unintelligible sentences'
'1','4624','because lots of things are free below this age'
'1','4627','because i moved in this year and would like to see how it was'
'1','4628','yes...many...!'
'1','4625','Don&#039;t like the idea of group seminars'
'1','4626','I expect to gain a thorough background in forensic and investigative psychology and prepare to write a thesis'
'1','4629','keeping up with the reading'
'1','4624','most of it. at the moment the first book review is woorying me slightly
'1','4632','mostly to do with workload'
'1','4630','that it will be difficult to do well in'
'1','4637','Why?'
'1','4628','what if when i am given a placement
'1','4627','workload...keeping myself organised!!'
'1','4625','to prepare me for a career'
'1','4628','me neither!'
'1','4634','to cover a broad range of topics
'1','4635','such as...?'
'1','4631','Feel a bit like I&#039;m the only one with no relevent work experience'
'1','4633','a littlle bit concerned about the expectations'
'1','4624','to get through it alive with whole range of skills that i can take with me on to future plans'
'1','4632','A detailed and up-to-date background in forensic psychology'
'1','4623','thats my concern also
'1','4629','how are we suposed to know what to do our dissertations on in week 1?!'
'1','4627','to provide me with a greater knowledge in the field and open career paths'
'1','4625','I can see them turning into a nightmare!'
'1','4628','because what should we do it on? what is the point of it? will we be marked?'
'1','4624','not getting one
'1','4631','Are we expected to cover all costs of transport etc. for our placements?'
'1','4626','besides academia
'1','4634','to figure out which area of IFP interests me  most'
'1','4625','I hadn&#039;t even thought about if we&#039;d be marked
'1','4633','a good starting point for a career with the police
'1','4624','finding a suitablle question<br />then a millions othjer things'
'1','4627','deciding on a topic and then working out how to actually do the research!'
'1','4623','ditto'
'1','4632','All the admin stuff (like the diary)'
'1','4624','how do i get into offender profilng 
'1','4631','I think they&#039;ll be quite good
'1','4628','i would become overwhelmed with the reading too...but i only read the things that i HAVE to... for example
'1','4626','I&#039;m in the same boat
'1','4632','Getting participants if I do an experimental study'
'1','4629','id love to know...!'
'1','4634','i don&#039;t think you will be given one if you don&#039;t want it'
'1','4636','to get the knowledges of forensic psychology'
'1','4633','how do I prepare for the placement to get the best out of it
'1','4631','I feel like we need a bit more advice on the types of books we should be reviewing
'1','4625','Getting the type of sensitive data I want'
'1','4634','going into an area which would bring potential employment'
'1','4623','most subjects seem like it would be incredibly hard to carry out experiments or get hold of data due to the nature of the subject'
'1','4629','i think it would be usefull to have a careers talk because iv not got a scooby do'
'1','4624','i dont think it too much to worry about ti think the idea is to get us to work together whcih will bring us closer as we r all panicking and all thinking what the hell do we do. end of it
'1','4628','ye- like
'1','4632','If you don&#039;t get onto a PhD
'1','4625','yeah
'1','4633','will there be any help with forming the research question? will it be supervised regularly
'1','4634','enthusiasm and willingness to learn'
'1','4628','i agree entirely!!!! what books should we read?!?!?!'
'1','4626','my relevant backgound knowledge from previous courses/experiences'
'1','4623','there is only 5 in the country so maybe look abroad!'
'1','4631','Same! I&#039;m worried about just launching into one I don&#039;t really know that much about and then regretting it when we cover other topics which I may find more interesting'
'1','4627','worried that i will not fill the expectations set by those that have done the placement before me'
'1','4636','my poor language skill'
'1','4632','Enthusiasm for learning and some previous knowledge'
'1','4628','i ahve no acedemic or working experience for this course
'1','4633','combining clinical and police work
'1','4624','well i think the idea is to compare the theme or topic from that booik with other reserach in that area and see what has been written differently
'1','4629','if the placement isnt in liverpool do we organise our own accomodation?'
'1','4627','enthusiasm for the subject'
'1','4634','it&#039;ll get better'
'1','4632','my thoughts exactly'
'1','4633','interest and enthusiasm
'1','4628','but i have put my name down for several....but if it seems too demanding or if its too far away and im not prepared to committ to it entirely dur to course demands?'
'1','4629','me too
'1','4627','me too'
'1','4629','i want to do a bit of everything before i have to commit to one thing'
'1','4628','thats a great question...!'
'1','4637','Also if you all work together to split the work up evenly and everyone does what they&#039;re supposed to do
'1','4628','yes! HOW??'
'1','4632','that seems a more sensible approach than what I was going to do (spend all day everyday reading everything)'
'1','4634','knowledge from previou work experience in forensic settings'
'1','4629','why thankyou'
'1','4635','what do you mean exactly?'
'1','4628','thats a concern of mine too- but thats what our supervisors are for'
'1','4624','no i dont think we are as lawrence said that ppl doing the tier three will miss it
'1','4625','everyone here who doesn&#039;t have english as their first language is doing amazingly with everything I think!!! Don&#039;t worry about it
'1','4633','I am also already a little bit overwhelmed with the reading
'1','4633','might be nice if the reading suggestions are in an order from the most to the less important one'
'1','4631','Costs of the course - trying to juggle part-time work (in order to actually pay for it) and then actual uni work too!'
'1','4636','It&#039;s good chance to learn from law enforcement and collect data.'
'1','4628','enthusiam- but everyone has that
'1','4629','if so who are u employed by?'
'1','4631','I&#039;d never actually thought about that -  now i&#039;m worried!'
'1','4625','That&#039;s really hard for me too
'1','4632','I don&#039;t think so. It will make it easier to follow the same lines later on because you&#039;ve got some previous knowledge
'1','4627','the level of work that is expected from us...standard of essay writing etc.'
'1','4633','That is also my concern
'1','4634','being able to fund my studies so that i dont have to worry about money and focus on uni work'
'1','4625','i&#039;m sure they take language skill into account as well when marking'
'1','4628','group seminars
'1','4634','that&#039;s absolutely true. i feel the same'
'1','4627','good oppprtunity to get out there and get first hand experience'
'1','4637','If we didn&#039;t have what we need to have to be on this course
'1','4631','Not alot! I&#039;m very interested but have no relevent work experience and am fresh from my undergrad course so pretty much feel my only skills are purely general academic psychology'
'1','4628','so if we&#039;re not marked
'1','4625','i think they should pay us per essay so we can earn some money back ;)'
'1','4633','like that we have to do a book review and everyone was like that&#039;s a pretty common thing to do and I thought &quot;I&#039;ve never done that before
'1','4628','well thats just great... we have to read more than one book in that area??!?!'
'1','4632','I think laurence meant they would miss the final day of the Tier 3 as it&#039;s just feedback
'1','4637','The first essay will probably be a bit of a learning curve for finding out about the standard of work needed to get good marks.'
'1','4636','just passion'
'1','4627','i am hoping that at somepoint throughout the course
'1','4624','i think the idea is u get out of it what u pout in
'1','4634','this interests me too. are we supposed to cover all related expences? for example
'1','4637','That would be brilliant!'
'1','4631','I know
'1','4637','That would be brilliant!'
'1','4633','with me it is more those shortcuts or regulations which seem to be common knowledge and which I sometimes don&#039;t understand'
'1','4625','I reckon we get a petition together ;)'
'1','4624','yeah but i think the idea is on a theme or topic within the bookk so its not everything
'1','4628','LETS DO IT!'
'1','4628','you can only do what you can do. why dont you have a word with your boss? the worst s/he can say is no. if not
'1','4627','the level of competition for getting a job after the course'
'1','4631','Same - don&#039;t want all my eggs in one basket so to speak!'
'1','4632','I have written a few essays
'1','4623','didnt he say you can get kicked off for that if they find out??'
'1','4633','I am also wondering if working on a topic in depth will enhance your chances everywhere or will it make you stick with that topic later on in your career'
'1','4625','I don&#039;t think they&#039;re going to be worthwhile either
'1','4634','what??'
'1','4628','no- but can prospective employers say &quot;you cant work for us because your dissertation is in a completely different area&quot;?&gt;'
'1','4633','will you have to stick with this topic in your career afterwards'
'1','4623','has anyone else not done any reading yet?!?'
'1','4633','is it difficult to get through this ethics test?'
'1','4624','well thhese first weeks arent to odiff i think its more trying to wean us in
'1','4625','my boss was dead reasonable about hours with me when I asked her
'1','4623','if you do over 15 hours your breaking your uni terms and conditions or something and you get kicked off'
'1','4633','Yeah
'1','4628','****why do you have to do the seminars?? surely if youre not marked on it
'1','4627','not 100% sure but i think that as soon as you work over either 15 or 20 hours you cease to become a full time student.  Its not just the university it is the tax office etc that this applies to...i think'
'1','4631','Yeah that&#039;s what I&#039;ve heard -  my boss is a horrible
'1','4633','What do you mean?'
'1','4628','i agree. its pointless'
'1','4625','I say &#039;ay&#039;'
'1','4629','nope
'1','4633','I like if everybody gets his part and it is not like you are responsible when others don&#039;t fulfill their part'
'1','4631','Thanks - that&#039;s a really good idea actually
'1','4625','get a new job with people that understand
'1','4634','not much'
'1','4628','ye- but how many chapters are in a book? how do we know which aspect of the book to do it on?'
'1','4625','I think they&#039;ll only be able to offer you hardship funding applications at this point in the year but definitely try!'
'1','4633','I think it might be really interesting
'1','4628','absolutely nothing. i feel overwhelmed. dont know wherer to begin...:-('

'1','4776','it was unnerving once negotiations were via the &#039;ink&#039;? insofar as the out of line of sight set up undermined normal intuitive trust. I have wondered since what damage this would cause to rapport established earlier in a real hostage scenario'

'1','4773','But it wasnt supposed to be an exercise for us to learn psychologically what happens during a hostage situation. we were merely tools for the police'
'1','4778','How would you have liked to be more involved?'
'1','4771','does that not just make it more realistic?...in a real life situation you would be under constant pressure in the bus and so it probably seemed longer because it was sitting around chatting not sitting in a real life situation'
'1','4775','Yeah once the machine was set us as a &quot;hostage&quot; you felt a little bit forgotten and abandoned...especially as you couldnt hear what thepolice were sayin on the bus'

'1','4775','I was suprised as to how inactive you are as a hostage (although in retrospect it makes sense)'

'1','4769','&quot;what happened at the racecourse??&quot;'
'1','4775','I was suprised at how quickly you start to feel like the police arent doing much for you and also how sometimes the police seemed to miss glaring obvious clues (maybe we just didnt see them pick up on them??)'
'1','4773','I think the negotiators were awful. If that was the actual response of a realy life negotiator I would not be surprised if all the hostages died.'
'1','4770','slow didnt seem too worried about the hostages but were concerned about what had gone on prior to the hostage taking - at the racecourse!!'
'1','4777','They seemed to be following a tight script constantly.'
'1','4769','i thought that the main guy played the hostage taker very well
'1','4776','the difference between the two negotiator teams was marked; whereas the first team seemed more nervous than the hostage takers the second undoubtedly assumed a more commanding (convincing) position from their arrival.  Having said that they clearly were at something of an advantage insofar as they would have arrived having had a briefing whereas the first team arrived &#039;cold&#039;.'
'1','4769','&quot;what happened at the racecourse??&quot;'
'1','4774','agreed. i&#039;m sure they were doing alot behind the scenes

'1','4770','paul was brilliant what a psycho!!'
'1','4777','I&#039;m surprised at how good the lead hostage taker was at acting.'
'1','4778','The fact that is sometimes felt like negotiators were missing obvious cues for building rapport. For example
'1','4773','My role was as a hostage. I thought the hostage takers executed their role extremely well. It is just a shame that that was the only role that was executed well
'1','4769','i dont think that the police negotiators responsed very quickly at all... did they know that it was a simulation? if so
'1','4778','How did that make you feel?'
'1','4771','the hostage takers played the roles well'
'1','4774','played a hostage taker
'1','4775','It felt a lot like the were just plodding along at a very slow pace - they seemingly missed a lot of clues - eg they kept on asking if anyone was hurt over and over again
'1','4776','I was surprised that the hostage taker was not aware where his weapons were at all times; exercise/inoperable weapons or not I felt uncomfortable about it.'
'1','4777','That even in a mock situation
'1','4770','i feel like as a hostage and a participant there wasnt enough information provided about what my role was to be prior to the event'
'1','4780','did nobody learn anything else?'
'1','4773','They could implement more training in hostage situations. I do not think the mersey tunnel situation represented a plausible situation for a hostage situation to occur.'
'1','4778','Do you have any specific examples of this?'
'1','4772','They were slow
'1','4768','the set up of the bus
'1','4772','The main hostage taker was particularly impressive!'
'1','4773','I feel the hostages were not provided enough information about the situation and task they were meant to perform. This I believe led to a lack of realism'
'1','4777','I agree
'1','4774','where the toilets are in the tunnel'
'1','4768','it would have been better to force the police to think of an alternative plan in order to communicate with him
'1','4777','The first aid kit was an apple.'
'1','4769','no
'1','4778','I learned that in a situation like this
'1','4770','perhaps a document explaining the backstory to the event
'1','4775','yeah when I was released off the bus I was given intstructions of how to act and what to say and when I reached the police they were just stood there chatting which was quite strange as I was told to leave in character. And then they wanted to take statements in character...it was hard to jump between the two'
'1','4774','that in a real situation like that
'1','4771','I disagree...I felt we were told about the role we needed to play at the right moment...ie when i do this scream...the situation is an ever changing one and the hostage taker was being fed information about what to do next and therefore it would have been difficult to tell us at the start what was expected of us'
'1','4773','Invest more time devising a logical and plausible hostage situation
'1','4776','I formed the distinct impression that the officer from the tunnel police who responded initially was actually about to discharge CS gas if the swearing hadn&#039;t intimidated him.'
'1','4777','Played a hostage
'1','4778','I was involved in night two
'1','4769','i agree with this. it felt like they were just trying to wrap things up. as a whole
'1','4778','Again
'1','4776','The use of a &#039;professional&#039; standard actor was impressive and
'1','4769','definately. very unassuring!'
'1','4772','I guess that&#039;s how it would be in a real situation though
'1','4777','Definately more information was required on what we should expect and what kinds of things we are likely to be asked to get involved in.'
'1','4775','I was a hostage. The people playing the hostage takers had a really hard job but pulled it off really well. They made it feel a lot more realistic
'1','4773','it felt like more attention was being focused on the actual racecourse crime itself than caring for the civilian lives that were endangered.'
'1','4770','its funny because at the time the situation was so real to me
'1','4776','can&#039;t say I learnt anything; it merely confirmed what I already knew ..... not destined for the stage!!'
'1','4777','But it was nice as you can keep constant conditions. But yes probably lacked a little realism.'
'1','4774','throw an unpredicted event into the equation
'1','4769','to be honest
'1','4772','Yeah if we had been told to be quiet and not to talk with each other
'1','4768','whether it is part of SOP or not
'1','4780','bet you never knew there were so many refuges down there!'
'1','4775','being able to see how the main hostage taker on night 2 dealt with things
'1','4772','When I got released and walked to the police only my fellow hostage was there to greet me
'1','4771','i agree with this when going to speak to the board thingy the negotiators missed several opportunities to explain that you cant both speak.  It was clear this is what was happening as it was clicking in mid sentence'
'1','4775','But then maybe thats how quickly they can respond in real life? Its not like you can just rush in and make rash decisions - people die that way'
'1','4769','i disagree. yes
'1','4772','I was very annoyed with the negotiators'
'1','4775','I dont think we should have been warned about what to expect! Thats no realistic is it! Maybe a character sheet would have been good though! Also
'1','4769','yes
'1','4768','further
'1','4781','What dis you expect in the way of toughness?'
'1','4773','Surely that&#039;s the biggest ciriticism- in a real life context controlled condition are the one aspect that shouldnt be controlled as they represented the actualities of a hostage situation. Whilst it was evident why the tunnel was closed
'1','4778','I was a hostage taker and on the plus I agree that negotiators managed to stay calm despite the fact that we gave them a pretty hard time. On the down side
'1','4774','i figured alf of their job is behind the scenes
'1','4777','I agree
'1','4769','i agree with you. learned nothing at all. was so unmoved and far removed from the thing that it was almost a waste of a night'
'1','4775','A fuller briefing and deriefing on the night would have been good - on the second night we werent really told to stay or go
'1','4773','surely staying calm is a necessity- id be worried if they panicked. On the first night the negotiators did panic. They left in a hurry leaving all their situation papers all over the tunnel.'
'2','4741','Did you feel your welfare needs were met thoughoutt he night (bearing in mind the constraints of the exercise)?'
'1','4776','Definitely mixed.  There were significant differences between the approaches of the two teams.  The first team appeared to be lacking in experience and
'1','4774','i thought they didn&#039;t do a bad job of building rapport
'1','4777','It appeared only situation at the bus was made to be real
'1','4769','we should have AT LEAST been told &quot;guys
'1','4771','we were almost too well looked after i think! things like being let go to the toilet and i probably ate my body weight in food!'
'1','4773','yes I think our welfare was met throughout the whole exercise. We were treated better than I thought we would and supplied with enough resourses to sustain the nights exercise. Overall I was very impressed by our treatment.'
'1','4775','definatly! Im still eating the food you gave me! Plus
'1','4768','it didn&#039;t help to the parked right next to the running water inside the tunnel
'1','4778','Equipment improvement. The speaker that was set up so that negs weren&#039;t in the line of fire was a bit awkward. The fact that when negs were talking this prevented them from being able to hear what H or HTs were saying is surely a bit of a design flaw. Also
'1','4770','after seeing what happened at the event i completely agree! i was shocked by their attempts to &#039;manage&#039; the situation'
'1','4777','We were surprisingly well looked after with food and drinks and even opportunities to go to the toilet. The conditions were not too cold as we were in the tunnel which was good.'
'1','4771','definately well looked after'
'1','4768','some people even brought their own comfy blankets!'
'1','4771','i thought we were going to have to negotiate food etc and it would have to be brought in by the police'
'1','4772','We were treated really well
'1','4769','yes
'1','4769','stolkhome syndrome or cheap student!?!'
'1','4773','defo cheap student!!'
'1','4769','haha!'
'1','4771','thought about doing a boat on the Mersey as another exercise?  might be a challenging one?'
'1','4775','I thought it would be tougher - both physically and mentally - although I suppose there is only so much you can inflict on people ethically...'
'1','4773','and sushi!'
'1','4778','The police were great in ensuring that all of our welfare needs were met. The downside of this is that as hostages we felt a little less immersed. However
'1','4774','as an exercise
'1','4770','my only criticism was that i think the hostage takers should have stayed in character the whole time to keep us intimidated'
'1','4776','hostage taker.<br />I thought the hostages played their roles well when they were in role.  However on our night the double decker bus proved a logistic hindrance to scenario immersion.  The hostages were up top and the hostage takers on the lower deck planning strategies. This was exaccerbated by the (to some extent) inevitable calls to the exercise controller. I think it would have been much better

People can always change their stroy or come up with another account. the Science if correctly and professionally done is extremly difficult to disprove - and must be the key priority<br />witness who sees vicitm go away with an &#039;agitated&#039; Cubby. there is only approx 1 hr 15 minutes after this sighting to when the vicitm was found dead. Cubby at the very least is our best witness - who can tell us what he saw/did with Martin - which we can prove/disprove with CCTV/forensically. He also must not be discounted as a suspect - and hours lost now tracing him may resul;t in loss of forensic evidence - which may asisst him/or the prosecution<br />scene parameters/search - the pathologist has idenfified that a blunt instrument/possibly hammer has been used by the person who murdered martin. It is essential therefore - to try and ensure that if it has been disposed of locally - that as well as the other scenes - a dump site can be identifed for this key piece of evidence. therefore POLSA advice critical    - time also not on our side - Railway line ? etc'
'1','4799','1. That the location the victim was found was likely to have been the scene of the attack - tis formed the opinion that there were considerable forensic opportunties available. The discovery of the body was time stamped and key witnesses were available at scene. This also enabled early consideration for H2H parameters and CTV assessment - both could potentially identify the movements of any suspect and the victim<br />2. TIE suspect - information became available that the victim had been at an address with others and had left only to return with the suspect - it is clear that he then left with the suspect to diffuse a potential situation. There was a window of approx 1hr and 15mins when the suspect may have been with the victim and killed him. The scene appeared to have considerable blood loss and footprints in blood at th scene.<br />An early arrest and positive action would maximise the opportunties to recovery evidence and minimise loss of evidence<br />3. The information supplied by the witness indicates that the suspect was rude and had left the address to keep the peace - this showed an aggressive mindset and the witnesses could potentially provide key evidence of the attitude of the suspect and can time stamp certain events<br />Created in order

'1','4800','Some duplication around the decisions and rationale i ahve expressed in early answers that maybe were required later.<br />The balance between treating the named persons in Feed 2 as witnesses or suspects
'1','4799','Also prior training and knowledge of the initia stages of this type of enquiry has helped. The same generic issues arise and have to be considered and included or discounted'
'1','4802','Paper feed limits flow of information that would be the case in real time MIR. Making decsions without knowledge of background of individuals. Knowledge of key witnesses and make them suspects ie Kenyon. Local knowledge of the key players on this investigation. Limiting number of main strategies.

'1','4805','To develop the strategies and fast track actions.<br />As the scenario unfolds
'1','4803','Make an assumption and not be open minded - ie Cubby didi it. he is the number 1 suspect - so close mind to other leads/avenues - and drive the enquriy towards this - as opposed to a balanced mind - ABC facts - run them past peers and review until conclusion reached'
'1','4802','Failing to keep options open and focusing in on Cubby
'1','4805','Scene management. Not setting adequate parametres. Not securing scene effectively
'1','4799','Making assumptions - and having a closed mind to other potential scenarios
'1','4800','Making assumtions as to how the victim came to be in that location with the injuries:<br />Failing to review the scene parameters as information develops;<br />Not requesting FSS to attend scene and provide expert advice and interpretation of scene;<br />Arresting all named persons in feed 2 immediately and obtaining no accounts/no comment IVs.'
'1','4804','Not ensuring all evidential opportunities are followed and seeking the support and experience of experts available to the SIO
'1','4801','1. Making assumptions in terms of the initial assessment. All factors need to be taken into account during this assessment in order to support the<br />2. Treating significant individuals as suspects when there is little or no rationale to support this. This can be caused through pressure from senior command'
'1','4801','The 24 hour review is probably the most pressing due to the time frame involved. Some enquiries may be in the very early stages and as such it may not be particularly effective
'1','4803','24 hour  You are tired - assimilating lots of information - and maybe a little fearful you may have overlooked something or got it wrong. accountability is at it&#039;s highes then - there may be lots of media interest/ ACPO direction/questions - when realistically you probably need some reassurance and guidance. You also have to be open to a critcal review and then flexible to acknowledge any mistakes you have made - learn from them - address them - and move on - without looking too much like an idiot - ie self preservation'
'1','4805','I wish to point out that I find the review process both helpful and supportive. I feel comfortable with the whole process and am glad of the &#039;extra pair of eyes&#039; in case I miss anything. However in order to answer the question
'1','4804','I don&#039;t have any difficulty with any of the reviews. I view them as an essential part of the investigative process to provide support at each stage and to ensure that all lines of enquiry have been undertaken. One issue within the review process which always raises comment is other ongoing caseload and resource implications
'1','4800','24 hour stage as this is very early and the SIO may not have possession of all the facts. You may not know who the victim is
'1','4801','The benefit is that where there is accountability
'1','4799','24 hour review - this is generally held at a time when so much is happening and key lines of enquiry are developing. It is an opportunity to be assessed and reassurred that key lines of enquiry seem to be correct. It is mildly distracting at a busy time but required and necessary<br />The 7 day and 28 day can be delivered in a more structured format. The 7 day review is at a time when more information is available and more meaningful decisions can be reached and assessed. 28 day review is similar'
'1','4804','I feel the review process provides support to the SIO and in turn provides accountability and transparency should the need arise. The issue with the 24 hour review is arond the SIO having time to sit down with the review officer.'
'1','4802','All three can be challenging depending upon the investigation. During the early stages of a BCU investigation the SIO is &#039;spinning plates&#039; invariably with miminum staffing levels and having to set
'1','4803','there is an old saying that in the police you are only one mistake off directing traffic - we do see things with a very critical eye and are quick to make judgments - that&#039;s part of our job<br />Internal criticism OK - with a confidential peer review on your ability methodology etc<br />However - outside criticism from a different department/higher rank who may not know what has actually happenened but has formed an opnion based on selective information - this may harm you professional standing and career impetus/aspirations. It can sometimes be easier to play it safe - not make big decision and hope it doesnt go &#039;tits up&#039; - will it work itself out ? preserve career by maybe waiting to make a decision or blaming someone else'
'1','4801','I beleive accountability within the police service as a whole is at a reasonable balance. In Merseyside
'1','4799','Pros - Allows a person to review key decisions and provide an overview.<br />Provides reassurance that decisions are well considered and stand up to scrutiny<br />Allows meaningful dialogue<br />Provides feedback and draws on others experience.<br />Provides transparency<br />Provdes public/organisational reassurance<br />Cons<br />Can&#039;t think of any con&#039;s'
'1','4805','Pros - Essential. To ensure we retain public confidence in our ability. To retain and share expertise in terms of peer review.  Experiential learning.<br />Cons - Not all those who examine others are credible. Blame culture can be prevelant.'
'1','4800','The SIO can be blinkered and focused on a line of enquiry and may consider or dismiss other lines. Independent reviews are there to support the SIO and investigation. They provide and independent perspective and fresh pair of eyes and can be supportive in identifying resourcing issues.<br />It also provides transparency and re-assurance to victims families and the community at large that the actions and investigations are continuously reviewed.<br />The negative side of them are that the SIO has to prepare and on some occassions that can occurat a crucial time during the investigation and can detract form the main objective.'
'1','4803','No - This is a pyramidal system - and you are only as good as your next job. I have rarely found that in the police a view is taken of all your good work over a period of years if you make one big mistake - that is what you are remembered/reknowned for  - again most have knowledge of this and this may mean that caution wins over decisiveness upon occasion.'
'1','4804','I think the accountability balance has been struck
'1','4802','Supports the SIO and identifies learning points areas of good practice at an early stage.<br />Ensures victim and family get appropraite service from Merseyside Police. Murder is the most serious ofence and cannot turn clock back
'1','4800','Yes I do.<br />The reveiw process is there to support the SIO and investigation team and to identify issues that may impact on any subsequent prosecution and protect the reputation of the force.'

'1','4811','It is slightly unrealistic as all paper feeds are.<br />Interpeting the fact that the shoes of the deceased had been removed.'
'1','4811','It is also always difficult to draw out priorities from the information though experience helps.'
'1','4815','Please ignore last comment
'1','4814','It is sometimes difficult to breakdown and prioritise decision making processes. A lot of what is done is a process to be worked through and at an early stage it is difficult to say one takes priority over any other. Clearly there are some fast tracl action lines of enquiry but they will all need doing as their relevance and importance can increase/decrease quickly dependant on developments elsewhere. Rationale sometimes appears repetetive but these are initial consideartions that will of course develop with the investiagtion as it develops
'1','4812','Lack of information regarding certain aspects of the circumstances surrounding the daeth. Not being able to attend at the scene. Not being able to sopeak to scientific expert regarding scene and  post mortem advice.  Not being able to seek the advice of crime scene manager.Not being able to make other decisions due to the absence of intelligence on the persons who are named in the task.'
'1','4815','The listing of HP actions
'1','4813','Normally the process adopted in an investigation is very dynamic and as such is in the first instance very task orientated but against a backdrop of a strategy. The process of reviewing priorities almost becomes second nature (unless resources dictate otherwise) Identifying Top three priorites is not something one would consciously consider but rather one would seek to idenify all the priorities but task out the most important first.'
'1','4814','Relativley straight forward to explain the general apprach to the securing and preserving of evidence to support and shape the investigation.'
'1','4811','Approaching the identification of priorities in a systematic way.<br />At least we have some wittnesses to go on fairly early !!'
'1','4813','Assessing from the information the tasks and actions to be considered following the initial assessment it is to be treated as a homicide'
'1','4812','Knowing what to do in any given situation where a body has been found and ensuring the principles of the golden hour are adhered to. This was easy to apply to this task'
'1','4814','Jumping to conclusions to soon
'1','4811','To jump to the conclusion that CUBBY is a suspect too soon. Though he is clearly a key individual
'1','4813','Making assumptions. In particular in relation to work that has been tasked out. Namley has it actually been prioritised in accordance with a given direction and that it is actually being progressed.'
'1','4815','The most probable mistake is to devlop a hypothesis at an early stage based on assumptions rather than facts.
'1','4812','From experience it is always vital that the services of experts are called upon to assist the investigation at an early stage. However the service of an expert in whatever field of expertise can be called upon at any stage of the investigation. The mistake that can be made is not to call on the services of an expert due to cost.'
'1','4814','Each provides challenges
'1','4811','I find the 24 hour review most difficult purely due to the fact that in my experience it gets in the way as it is a little too soon. I feel that 48 or better still 72 hours is more appropriate and in practice it often takes place at this stage. I accept that the first 24 hours is the most important time in any investigation
'1','4812','Personally ther most difficult period of reviewing murder investigations is at 28 day period. The reasons for this are many. Some of the common themes are loss of evidence
'1','4815','The 28 days review is probably the most difficult.<br />This review process is  very subjective and can sometimes lead to differing of opinions.  Because of the subjectivity it is not always seen as a suppportive process.'
'1','4811','The pros are that it keeps the police service in check. We have some pretty strong powers that we can bring to bear on the community and accountability is there to stop us abusing that authority.<br />I can&#039;t think of any cons
'1','4814','Police service must be accountable as we police by consent &amp; trust. Danger of the system being weighted to heavily in favour of defendant. It can create a culture of being risk averse as mistakes are not permited when we are judged in hindsight for dynamic decision making in very testing circumstances. Hours of investigation and consideration can be given to a decision that was made immediatley.'
'1','4813','I would suggest that 28 day  review is probably slightly more difficuly  than the earlier reviews. Although sometimes 24 hours and 7 day reviews can been an inconvenience only because of the demands placed upon your time.<br />Regarding the 28 day review
'1','4811','The tri-partite accountability balance is often &#039;skewed&#039; by political influences such as government drive for accountability through performance targets etc. In my experience the operational autonomy of Chief Officers has been eroded over the past 20 years through the &#039;drip drip; effect of Home Office central influence.'
'1','4812','From an SIO perspective
'1','4815','The Police service should always be accountable. From a SIO perspective it is interesting that decsions made today can have ramifications may years down the line
'1','4811','It seems to me that there is a fine line between appropraite accountability with operational autonomy and directive central influence. In my view this line is too often crossed in recent years.'
'1','4814','There is a real danger with the 24 hour media world that someone always has to be found to blame. The police do seem to be disproportianatley held to account and blame for societies ills. In fairness this culture extends beyond the police service to others such as social work &amp; probation.<br />Hindsight is a wonderful thing!!'
'1','4813','It is crucial that the service is accountable on a number of fronts<br />1. it maintains high standards and ensures that there is a system whereby we can measure our own performance against for example public expectations<br />2. It allows for open and auditable reviews from which we can learn and impliment best practise<br />3. It ensures that the public can have confidence in the nature of police work and that even if mistakes are made that they are not endemic within the organisation and that the focus of policing is to provide an effective and professional service'
'1','4815','Recent events have brought into sharp focus our levels of accountability. Our actions are
'1','4812','At a more senior level yes

'1','4883','1. The main difficulty was the delay in receiving funding agreement which delayed much of the planning.<br />2. An element of too many cooks.....there were a number of people at Ch Supt level involved in strategivc decision making.'
'1','4877','The second issue was beyond the control of the planning process in that I was on leave and courses prior to the final week of the planning so it meant I was behind on the meetings and had a lot of cathcing up to do - this wouldn&#039;t be an issue at future conferences.'
'1','4880','The uncertainty of the financial reimbursement meant that staffing could not be finalised with any degree of certainty until very late stages. This caused frustration amongst area resource teams and friction with the staff associations as large numbers of rest days had been cancelled.<br />The second issue was a lack of clarity over deployment and availability of resources. This was caused by having multiple silvers
'1','4884','1) Command structure caused some confusion pre-event. Additional meetings that excluded key people and this caused unecessary difficulties.<br />Not convinced by the need to have a PSU Silver<br />2) Planning team resilience and experience. The team worked very hard and against a demanding schedule but progress of the Silver plan was left unchecked and this causeda vulnerability late on.'
'1','4889','The available resources (from Government) meant that the conference had to be policed on the basis of informed risk analysis rather than as a totally secure site.<br />The above meant that certain forseeable threats e.g. bogus bomb call into hotel
'1','4886','Timescale for planning - The inability of the Home Office to make a decision re funding which had a knock on effect in terms of our ability to complete the plans in time. In addition
'1','4887','1) limited timescales caused by the creation of the coalition government in May. This led to a three month planning window
'1','4888','1. The team who predominatly had no previous relevant experience were brought together at relatively short notice
'1','4879','Where to start?...<br />There were lots of issues (listed below) the big ones in summary being<br />1. Lack of experience - us and key stakeholders<br />2. Lack of clarity re funding and therefore resources<br />Contributing to both were:<br />That we&#039;d never planned a policing a conference before<br />that the lib dems had never had security before<br />That there was national review of the policing of party conferences ongoing but with nothing written down<br />that the HO were intent on saving money without actually addressing the issues of consistency and risk in any meaningful way<br />that we had tight time limits<br />that the key players were mostly in london and &#039;too busy&#039; to visit liverpool<br />the number of stakeholders that needed managing local and national<br />lack of certainty re finance<br />need for big decisions on issues such as kitting out a control room in Mather Ave which had to be made but without the information and money needed to make them sensibly'
'1','4880','Ideally
'1','4891','Resourcing decisions being changed often. This caused lots of unnecessary work for many people and delayed planning. The short amount of time available to plan the operation also caused difficulties when combined with the chopping and changing when making decisions'
'1','4888','A bigger team needs to be created to reduce the workload and stress involved. Also to spread the workload during the actual event.<br />6 months should be the absolute minimum required to plan and deliver future operations of this kind.'
'1','4884','Single Event Silver<br />The silver plan could be moved to Force operations. The Conference team could operate in much the same way but with the knowledeg that the Silver plan was being completed by experienced planners with a perspective on Force commitments. This is not to say that those responsible did a poor job; excellent effort in deifficult circumstances. However
'1','4886','Try and identify a Single point of Contact for the Home Office and obtain an early decision re funding i.e. at least nine months prior. Make early contact with the Labour Party re their aspirations for the Conference<br />The Force now has experience of policing a Party Conference and it is important that the Force utilises the skills and experience acquired for the next Conference. Having said that it is also important that the Force realises that the next Conference will be different from the Lib Dems and the plans should be be-spoke and not just a &#039;cut and pste&#039; of the last plans'
'1','4891','I would hope that we would be allowed more time to plan the event. I think that decisons need to be made early on around resourcing.'
'1','4889','The likelihood is that funding will continue to be an issue but it is important to argue cogently for at least sufficient funding to minimise the risk to the greatest extent possible.<br />Whilst the above clearly turns on an assessment of risk
'1','4884','As above. Answer 1b refers to Silver plan completion; 1a is the single Silver'
'1','4877','In regards to issue one the problem arises because BCUs cannot always submit resource details to an event other than to say that they will provide an inspector or 4 sergeants for example. They may have a problem themselves identifying exactly who that is until late on. One preference I would have is for the same staff to be nominated for all of the days from across the force. Advance planning (ie knowing that in 12 months time we have a Labour conference) we should be able to determine what staff are currently showing as being on duty now and with the relevant occupational qualifications - ie APOC /IPOC / bronze commander / Tac Ad. The force suffers at present because so many people are occupationally competent but operationally competent. Using the officers with trained skills more often and as part of a dedicated Cadre would prove more effective. Senior leaders would then feel more confident that the staff appointed to the event are capable of doing the role without recourse to have death by meetings to ensure work is being done.'
'1','4888','One Silver Commander for the event and quicker decisions.'
'1','4887','I think the limited timescale was as a result of the General Election results and is unlikely to occur before the next event
'1','4882','this was made difficult as the steer was changed and additional work was added but this became a fending off process.<br />Partners were not as helpful as had been anticipated and maybe the political nature of the event had a bearing on this.<br />There were lots of other elements of the plan which directly affected the planning and there were a couple of departments who saw this and we were able to help however this was not across the board and the nearer the event got the more difficult it became.<br />The fact that the site was on private land caused a mulitude of problems and the joined up thinking was challenging as each had thier own agenda/issues which to them were the most important.<br />very late on the requirement for a stand down plan was considered and that took a considerable amount of work which then appeared to be over scrutinised and still caused issues because as soon as the event is over everyone wants to go home asap. Too many what ifs and an unclear idea of what each role/department can bring this resulted in planning which was not needed.'
'1','4879','1. is quite easy as we now have some good experience
'1','4883','1.  Whilst there will be a longer lead in period we should plan a number of scenarios so that we can adapt depending on funding levels.<br />2. One event Silver to be engaged in the planning working closely with the event coordinator and a stronger link to Force Ops through the Gold staff officer.'
'1','4884','Coordinator role was effective. The &#039;fixer&#039; role was a real bonus.<br />Professionalism of staff on the ground supported by the Gold Commander&#039;s cognisance of officer welfare.'
'1','4889','The visibility of staff on the ground was good and the best was clearly made of the overall funding obtained.<br />Staff appeared well motivated
'1','4877','Advance briefings and the quality of the briefing packs - these proved essential to me as I knew the venue layout prior to getting to the site on the days
'1','4880','The willingness of officers do do a good job and be flexible whilst often working in challenging conditions over long hours. Similarly the professional manner in which supervisors conducted themselves
'1','4883','1. The relationships developed between the policing team and the partners involved undoubtably contributed to the success.<br />2. The public order issues were well thought through and well planned there was a clear idea structure and plan and sufficient resources.'
'1','4891','The logistics side of the event was succesful. I think this was due to the sheer hard work and commitment of the team. Everybody pulled together and took responsibilty for making sure it was successful. The briefings were particularly successful recieving very good feedback from officers. I think this was down to the how the briefing officer had designed the briefing package'
'1','4882','Earlier involvment and maybe a dedicated role position in the team which would allow better understanding of many of the issues.<br />A clear steer and focus on roles and responsibilities. A willingness to listen and not take the stance of this is going to happen and you need to do that in the best and easiest way<br />Stand down plan needs to be in focus from the off.'
'1','4888','1. The planning team given its size
'1','4879','1. The policing tone/style of policing worked really well - professional
'1','4886','The whole event went well primarily because the planning team invested a lot of time with the landowners
'1','4885','1. My element of the plan was in relation to issues that could arise.  It was necessary therefore to produce a comprehensive plan to deal with every possible contingency arising from an anticipated event.  In effect this was virtual planning but
'1','4887','The creation of a dedicated planning team that included the security coordinator and specialist planners
'1','4877','The hotel liasion officers provided an invaluable informal contact with delegates and helped promote the &#039;Just Talk&#039; agenda - the success of the operation was summed up by considerable numbers of the public approaching officers with kind comments about the style of policing adopted. They considered that even during teh evening when some of the behaviour was boisterous due to alcohol that the hotel liaison were policing the environment with a strong awareness of the nature of the environment around them - comments such as &quot;visible but not oppressive&quot; were often attributed to the staff.'
'1','4883','1. we need to be very clear about command structure right from the outset.  This will give the planning team better clarity and assist the whole planning process.<br />2. The intelligence flows were appaling and this will need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  This will enable us to better plan resources and in particular not have the same level of resources on duty every day without the intelligence to support it.'
'1','4879','1. closer enbedding of the prot operation into the overall aims of the operation. This would have prevented potential for breach of the security operation by the prot team and smoothed communications between the two. Ensuring prot officers and commanders attended the wider briefing would have assisted this
'1','4877','Officers on the static points were risk assessed for the whole event as requiring body armour. For many this meant long hours either stood still or walking with full kit for protracted periods. On reflection a more dynamic risk assessment process in respect of the body armour threat could have been carried out daily. Whilst the threat of terrorist attack cannot be planned out completely in respect of these events the overall threat level was low. In any other form of policing a low threat level would not necessitate the need for body armour.'
'1','4891','The silver control suite was unsuitable
'1','4882','Links with certain departments and staff who understood the benefits and relationships.<br />food maybe too much!<br />Having departmental links in Silver and on the ground who knew the plan and its objectives.<br />In the end the willingness to accept little disruption to the road network.<br />Performance indicators from the troops.<br />Although late consultation with outside agencies and the high level of co-operation.<br />Management around the search site which if looked at in isolation could have been the biggest headache but was possibly the best part.<br />In general the minimum disruption to the travelling public around the whole site and city.'
'1','4884','Clarity on a Command Structure that complies with national guidelines. This removes personality issues and unecessary problems/obstacles from the pre event phase. This would also be crucial if the Conference encountered demanding public order problems where the command would be severely tesetd.<br />The relationship between the Planning team and Force Ops. This needs to be &#039;joined up&#039; to ensure that the organisation makes use of the resources
'1','4886','Accreditation. I believe a reliance on Greater Manchester Police to carry out the accreditation on our behalf left Merseyside Police vulnerable (e.g. the imposition of unrealistic timescales for the completion of accreditation). This timescale brought us into conflict with ACCL<br />There needs to be corporate support for the Gold Commander from across all portfolios.There was very limited planning experience within the planning team
'1','4889','As above
'1','4888','1. The same resources (as far as practicable) need to be used each day to reduce the delay between briefings and actual deployment on the ground to the event. This requires each BCU resource manager agreeing to resource the event in the same way.<br />2.  The use of HQ for everything e.g Silver
'1','4885','2b) (i).  The shift change overs need to be better co-ordinated.  There was at relevant times of the day a mass movement of yellow jacketed officers across a main dual carriage way.  This could have presented the wrong impression for members of the public in terms of overall numbers of officers and the potential knock on effect for them in terms of the policing of local communities.<br />(ii)  I am not convinced that there was a comprehensive and appropriate investigative strategy for this event.  This again would have been a contingency but one that could have been implemented in the case of a serious event.'
'1','4880','The changing of staff on a sometimes daily basis caused issues with briefing
'1','4887','The Command structure was effective during the operation because command protocols were clearly established
'1','4877','The changeover process coudl have been easier between sections going off after 12 hours and those coming on. Some staff were arriving on the evening not having been given a static posting and expecting that the sergeants on the ground allocated them on arrival. This was not an issue when the same staff from a BCU were used each day as it became part of the pre-brief before arriving on site. This slicker approach would have helped reduce overtime costs.<br />CBRN officers were deployed into what would be the &#039;hot zone&#039; (static posts 19-31) . Shoudl it have been deternmined that a CBRN capability was required it would have been better to have these officers merely at nominate stage within a BCU each day and not part of the overall static points. Had an incident occurred logistical issues would have occurred as the chances are most would likely to be taken out by the contaminating effects of the attack.'
'1','4886','This should have been an answer for 1b'
'1','4888','3. PLEASE NOTE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN RESPONSE TO 2b'
'1','4882','Earlier involvment to avoid late plans and mild panic.<br />better and earlier involvment with planning barrier contractor.<br />Little understanding of the impact and disruption.<br />Stand down plan needs to be better planned and earlier.'
'1','4877','The CBRN contingent was deployed to static points in the arena security. This was impractical based on the likely 100m contamination area that was in place (see answers 2b). The CBRN staff should not have been nominated to do static points and shoudl have been retained in BCUs until required. They could still work 12 hour shifts but would not have been needed to operate barriers.'
'1','4884','Command Structure - PSU Silver<br />This does not comply with national guidelines and it would almost certainly be questioned had something wrong.<br />That said
'1','4883','1. There would be concern at the number of silver commanders and the roles each of them were playing in the command structure which could potentially have led to confusion and a lack of understanding around who was responsible for what aspects of the operation.<br />2. There were aspects of the vehicle search they potentially made the venue vulnerable most notably the closeness of the vehicle search to the venue entrance and secondly the fact that the Jury&#039;s Inn was effectively an unprotected site caused vulnerability.'
'1','4889','In the event of a critical incident
'1','4880','Role clarity. If things had gone wrong
'1','4883','NOTE TO FACILITATOR This should have been attached to question three'
'1','4891','The location of the silver command was too close to the conference site. This should have been facilitated at another location.'
'1','4886','Did the planning team have the requisite experience and knowledge to complete their individual roles ?<br />It should have been &#039;best person for the job&#039; based on skills and experience<br />The time given to plan the event was too short a timescale exacerbated by some very late decisions from the Home Office re funding.<br />There needs to be much earlier decisions regarding funding'
'1','4891','This comment is in relation to question 3'
'1','4879','1. The operation was not in line with current ACPO guidelines or consistent with the other 2 party conference operations which faced the same threats. I don&#039;t know what more we could have done about this...<br />2. Length of time firearms and armed prot officers were on duty. In relation to first we built in sufficient &#039;down time&#039; but could still have been subject to challenge re working hours and in the second we had to do some accommodating mid-operation
'1','4877','The number of police officers on the operation was excessive. Many of the static points were suitable for G4S or other security companies to cover. They were working teh same event as the polcie and subject therefore to the same level of threat as the officers and yet they did not require the wearing of body armour. This indicates that the site threat level was low and therefore less police officers could have been deployed and better use of private security made. This would have reduced the policing costs and helped set a precedent for the future policing of conferences at the venue. Shhould the threat from terrorism be higher then numbers could be adjusted accordingly but given a low threat on this occasion the number of police officers dedicated to static points could have been significantly reduced.'
'1','4884','See last bullet point for 2b - entered in wrong section<br />3. We would have had a problem with a Silver plan that was not created in tried and tested Merseyside format. The plan was
'1','4879','re 2. point we could either have built in extra staff to reduce working day or maybe put plans to external scrutiny for external opinion?'
'1','4882','Was the protest site at the correct location for the protesters.<br />The area was not suitable for standing for long periods of time.<br />mainly  hidden from view and not very inviting.<br />More pressure to be put on land owners  due to the site constraints and multiple ownership.<br />Was silver control in the correct loaction.<br />Too close to the event and could have been in the cordon area in the event of terrorist threat or car bomb etc.<br />Could have had link and room at alternative location with some if not all facilities in case of one of above.'
'1','4887','Time scales for plans dictated that written documents were submitted and tested at both tabletop exercise and adversarial briefing before the plans were finalised
'1','4888','1. Too many Police officers engaged on the operation
'1','4885','The integration between the police and the private security firms fronting the event whilst apaprent in terms of relationship did not transpose to physical activity.  The security companies failed each of the tests put to them

'1','4889','I agree
'1','4897','FAC - is anything planned to feed this positive response/comments back to those invovled?'
'1','4877','Yes - all the staff received some form of recognition in person at the closure of the event. (personal thank you

'1','4894','FAC - Where there particular areas where you thought too many officers had been deployed and why?'
'1','4887','Should read ---- The late provision of an event specific threat assessment dictated that planning was to the generic threat levels. Limited funding meant that if the evnet specific threat assessment had indicated a raised threat Merseyside Police would have struggled to upgrade plans to resond.'
'1','4889','In a perfect world I would agree with this however
'1','4886','The threat to the event was Moderate not LOW. The event specfic threat from IRT was moderate .'

'1','4877','The staff that were appointed were ideal but I don&#039;t think the police is very scientific in its resource planning - we may ask for &#039;experienced officers&#039; but we don&#039;t often know what we want them for or to do'
'1','4886','Discussions have already taken place with GMP regarding teh next conference with a detailed MOU being proposed.<br />Some of the problems may have been down to personaility issues from key staff'

'1','4894','FAC - Could you please elaborate on what the role of security firms where and how do you believe they failed in the tasks?'
'1','4883','Yes the protest site was determined by the public order silver without recourse to the event silver'
'1','4884','Additional meetings outside of the structure
'1','4877','The threat changed (according to the briefings) as the event went on. The point has been made to show that we are often risk averse and that many other staff at the event did not have access to body armour - maybe we build in extra breaks or have staff standing around in kit for less time or don&#039;t work 12 hour duties.'

'1','4937','not having enough time to do the assessments. it would be good if things were a little more spread out
'1','4942','I wouldn&#039;t call it an anxiety but obviously the course is quite stressful when the deadlines are near and you worry about how are you going to finish everything on time.'
'1','4943','I agree!!! I am super stressed!!! Everything seems to be going over my head and I&#039;m getting super stressed'
'1','4935','I am unsure about what to do from now on considering the little time we have left in uni. Whether to move home or stay here etc. Staying here would be exceptionally lonesome considering the lack of lectures.'
'1','4939','I&#039;m having problems following the stats class - esp R. I&#039;ve always been quite weak at stats and was kindof hoping that the classes will start with the basic of MANOVA

'1','4941','I am considering interviewing and would like to work with Graham Wagstaff and/or Jacqueline Wheatcroft.'
'1','4933','I have serious concerns about carrying out the statistics on my dissertation as for the last few years I have become familiar with SPSS and now have to learn a totally new method called r-language that while good in theory uses way too much syntax and has gone over most of the classes head and i&#039;m sure everyone will end up trying to learn the SPSS methods on their own'
'1','4936','I agree
'1','4942','Well
'1','4934','I think the statistics program is a little difficult for most of us to follow. Because of this
'1','4933','i totally agree i&#039;m going to have to just learn spss for my stats on my own :('
'1','4939','Why can&#039;t we work with SPSS? I can&#039;t even do MANOVA

'1','4930','SPSS is still widely used
'1','4943','This would be really benefitial .. I brought this up  a while back I def think it would be useful'
'1','4933','well yes but it would be of far more benefit to learn the method that you will be using in your dissertation rather than something for the cv'
'1','4937','i agree
'1','4941','I know we don&#039;t have to
'1','4935','I think learnign a new program is good. I don&#039;t think the problem is learning R&lt; I think that it is the way we are taught it.<br />Having a additinoal tool under our belt does make you more employable.'

'1','4930','Nothing limits your choice of program or Stats. As long as you argue correctly why you choose a specific one!'
'1','4942','Definitely agree with that. If the workload was more spreaded throughout the year it would be less stressful. Or even having one of the assigments during the course of one module and then having another assignment in at the end.'

'1','4933','Oh god yes!!!<br />we seriously need to know about jobs because I have no idea where to start or what sort of job i will be qualified for and it&#039;s getting a bit overwhelming especially considering that deadlines can be quite early!'
'1','4935','Laurence.. But because of his absense I think I will be co-supervised by Jacqueline.'
'1','4937','but we dont even get assessed on this new method'
'1','4932','What area where you thinking of?'
'1','4939','Leadership in high reliability organisations - I&#039;m hoping to work with either Laurence or Louise'

'1','4934','I dont think there have been contributions from me
'1','4933','it is so applied orientated so you can see how the stuff that you learn can be applied in real settings that you may not have realized.<br />the interesting variety of guest speakers make the course<br />the lecturers are all quite approachable and usually happy to help'
'1','4939','Transfering and applyign the knowledge we have learnt in an actual work setting'
'1','4940','learning things about crimes that we can&#039;t tell other people - makes me feel special

'1','4935','The lecture slots and timetable.<br />Oh yes. Inconsistency in marking. Told one thing by a lecturer
'1','4944','Stats ... in particular R!!!<br />Having some of the deadlines close together or when we have a new module starting ... makes things very stressful<br />Irregular feedback .. or feedback that contradicts itself'
'1','4939','Stats... It&#039;s been a struggle'
'1','4936','very inconsistent in marking; but could be good to handle a variety of boss&#039;s/job expectations'
'1','4937','agree'
'1','4933','the lack of training in advanced SPSS methods is my primary concern. or even an introductory class to r-language rather than diving into regression on day 1.<br />maybe spreading out some of the deadlines such as having a presentation at the same time as 2 assignments.<br />lack of facility to help with obtaining placements.'
'1','4944','R has gone over so many heads'
'1','4941','oh yea! And the computers. Saving a doc opened from an attachment doesn&#039;t actually save it and i&#039;ve lost lots of work becuase of this. Not really the course

'1','4935','Dissertation selection. Whilst I enjoy the oppertunity to construct our own. data collection can seem ambiguous
'1','4944','Field trips would have been great .. especially after being told about previous ones'
'1','4942','Yeah
'1','4934','Stats!!<br />Assessment inconsistencies!'
'1','4935','Couldn&#039;t agree more. I have been gonig to court which has made this unit far more enjoyable.'
'1','4944','Night out soon?'
'1','4936','yes'
'1','4933','yes it is a bit daunting because there are so many different choices that i just end up like a deer in headlights.'
'1','4930','Have you tried engaging some of the supervisors/researchers on this?'
'1','4940','I concur. I&#039;d love to go into personality disorders and intellectual difficulties a bit more'
'1','4941','Agreed.'
'1','4935','Irrelevant. But I really should mention Ian.<br />Without him taknig his time to come to our lectures they would not have been half as good.<br />Studying with CAMI only for stats is a waste. I would rather
'1','4937','yeah i agree court has been really helpful
'1','4933','court tomorrow woooooo<br />if i make it....'
'1','4936','court is amazing! I do feel like we had a good overview but more in depth on certain topics would have been great'
'1','4944','It hasn&#039;t be taught in the best of ways esp as its more directed at Research Methods'
'1','4934','its not that bad
'1','4942','I agree with your 3rd comment. I think it would be brilliant if we could actually go out and try out something in the field or just observe as part of the course.'
'1','4941','Agreed'
'1','4937','i agree. Ian has been a star'
'1','4944','Agreeeeeed!!'
'1','4933','it obviously must be if the whole class are having difficulties!'
'1','4936','like'
'1','4934','i agree too!!1'
'1','4940','Here here'
'1','4936','like'
'1','4937','plus he has been a god save for seminar days'
'1','4940','Love'
'1','4939','Ian&#039;s been great indeed!'
'1','4934','yup!!!'
'1','4935','I personally don&#039;t mind stats.<br />Consider the following line<br />&quot; I have studied statistics and Advanced statistics at undergraduate and post graduate level. I also have a wealth of practical experience with SPSS and R&quot;.<br />Screams &quot;employ me now&quot;<br />I would be more stressed if I was doing a dissertation and reliant on my undergraduate statistics.'
'1','4933','yeah we have to make sure we meet up once class ends!!!!<br />cos stats can&#039;t be the only thing that holds us together!'
'1','4941','DEAL'
'1','4944','We all need to get diaries out as soon out deadlines are over :)'
'1','4933','risque'
'1','4930','Could you elaborate on what you mean by this?'

'1','4933','ian has been great
'1','4941','hahaha. Me too man.'
'1','4941','Aww you guys. you ARE special.'
'1','4935','To address this. I mentionned my use of R in an interview as a crime analyst
'1','4944','Big fat lie on your CV ....  Sounds good but when they ask you to do it .. its a no go!!!'
'1','4941','I love this too.'
'1','4941','AND he helped us ALL with our seminar day. The little superstar.'
'1','4942','Yeah
'1','4935','If it is no good it is my lack of preperation for the interview.<br />I haven&#039;t &quot;studied the intricies of significant hypothesis testing&quot; either
'1','4939','Well
'1','4933','i know but the reason that happens is people end up getting frustrated and even when i asked a question it can be difficult to get an answer.'
'1','4934','What if they ask you to explain wht it is!! Its like purposely placing ur head under the axe!'
'1','4937','i just dont think it is being taught in the right way
'1','4941','I love the fact that some of us have started going down to court. its amazing. So interesting. We really hope that Mark wont get charged with murder. But Colin and Alan better.'

'1','4935','My dissertation issue is that it is involving a external body and this has made getting data far more stressful.'

'1','4944','I hope so ... my dissertation my be safe'
'1','4934','ya she is gonna start soon! And i remember her saying that she uses SPSS'
'1','4940','definitely!'

'1','4944','Me too!!'
'1','4942','Lol! You&#039;re welcome.'
'1','4933','yeah i know
'1','4944','It would have been really useful to have more time with the CAMI students instead of relying on just Ian. We only got a few weeks with them and it would have been nice to get more contacts and insights which we lost out on.'
'1','4933','who said this!'
'1','4944','It would have been useful to be given a deadline regarding access to information for dissertations at the beginning and where we could get info from. This would maybe give us more focus areas too.'

They have entered the building and made to the second floor where they have been fired upon by a suspect with a pistol and one officer is injured having been shot sustaining an injury to the arm.  Arv crews have returned fire but it is not known at this stage how many shots that have been fired.  It is unknown how many suspects are in the building at present.  It is known that there are other people within this building although it is not confirmed how many at present.  The identity of the suspect(s) is unknown at this time but they have discharged a firearm at officers so have shown an intent and capability.  I have reviewed the authority to arm at this stage and that authority continues as I have reason to believe that officers have to confront armed suspects.  (PC)'
'1','5109','I am taking on the role of TFC for this incident. The initial aim of the operation is to identify
'1','5105','Following briefing
'1','5103','Info/Intel - report of burglary at Bangor university where chemicals have been stolen. It is not known at this stage what these chemicals could be used for (need clarity on the chemicals and what they could be used for). Police have attended and report a suspicious vehicle outside with maps of university campus (who owns this
'1','5106','In addition there is also a threat regarding the chemicals believed to be liquid cesium however it is not known what the purpose of the burglary is or whether or not the subject(s) have been in contact/utilised the chemicals. Control must be maintained of these chemicals as soon as possible which must include control of the subject(s) to ensure the chemicals do not leave the premises.(JC)'

'1','5108','The suspects may be in possession of sezium or other chemicals from the store room and it is not known what there intention is at this stage with the chemicals.  Tac advisor has bee consulted in relation to these and advice will be appended to this log.<br />My strategy at this stage is to protect the members of the public who are in the immediate vicinity ie in the university building (high risk)
'1','5106','Authenticate - CBRN expert advice has been provided is that the chemical is presently in an inert form and is fatal if released. It is not known at this stage what quantity is present and if released subject to weather conditions how far this could be spread in the locality.'
'1','5103','Tactical Options continued - 2. Develop intelligence - adopted their are currently gaps in the info/intel and this will tend to fill these gaps
'1','5108','CBRN advises that seizium is in the form of a liquid which is held in a pressurised container.  If released then this could become gaseous and radioactive.  Information to be passed to team leader at the scene.<br />Intelligence has been obtained that internet chat rooms have carried details of such an offence and enquiries are underway in relation to the identities of the persons responsible.

'1','5106','Authenticate - ARV officers engagement with the subjects
'1','5105','lol - I would evacuate as much of the building as safely possible to minimise risk to people currently in the building. I would take cognisance of CBRN Tac Advice with regard to evacuation e.g. not downwind and awahy from line of sight of subjects current positioon and any potential crossfire. I would arrange the attendance of specialist resources to deal with any subsequent CBRN issues as they will take up to 1 hour to mobilise. I would seek additional firearms resources to contain and subsequently overwhelm the subjects. I would secure the services of a negotiator.'

'1','5104','Tactical Options and action<br />Wait and gather intelligence. Not adopted. There is need to act immediately to save and preservce life.<br />Allocate unarmed officers to the scene. Adopted. However the unarmed officers will be briefed to maintain an outer cordon to stop people entering the building. Additionally
'1','5109','Grounds - At this time limited resources available at the scene with uncertainty regarding the intention and capability of the offenders. CBRN equipped officers at least one hour from the scene. Threat assessment undertaken High risk to potential hostages and responding officers. Also high risk to wider public in the area

'1','5103','Contingencies - In consultation with Tac Ad I have considered the following; 1. Flight - nearest AFO to challenge the subject with direction to seek to prevent the substance from being allowed to leave the building (CBRN tac advice suggests that implications of this would be dire).'
'1','5106','You have assessed the risk to MOP as high
'1','5105','article 2 is engaged - shots are being fired now - CBRN threat is a possibility. ICI ( capability and intent) re. firearms is known ICI (capability and intent )re. CBRNis not known) therefore the firearms threat needs to be addressed first.'

'1','5110','Yes - decision based upon CBRN info re susbstance becoming gasseous if released from cannisters
'1','5105','Having earlier secured the services of a negotiator I would now employ them in order to but my OfCom sufficient time to develop a dynamic intervention plan. I would ask the negotiaitor to establish the identity capability and intention of the subjects

I am going to ask him what esle he needs and to reinforece the idea that we can come to a safe solution. The reason my decision wil achive safe resoltuion byu leeting Skyn News in is that his principle aim seem to be an outlet to express his concerns over his treatment and the tretament of colleagues and so doing allows him a &#039;a voice&#039; and to be heard.

Dennison appears to understand the suspect and his medical condition. A familiar an trusted TPI will be a valuable part of the negotiation and communication strategy and can help to bring the situation to a speedier resolution safely.<br />3. Using Dennison allows control over her communication to Aitkins in a structured manner that will support the negotiation tactics.<br />I am maintaining this decision unless:<br />1. Intelligence comes to light which indicates that Dennison is part of the planned criminality.<br />2.. The presence of dennison starts to cause a greater degree of anxiety to the suspect<br />3. The negotiaition coodinator advises that the use of Dennison will adversely impact upon the successful negotiaition and communication startegy'

'1','5125','The overarching strategic aim remains the same.<br />The decision is not to use Dennison as a TPI.<br />My rationale for this decision achieving the strategic aim is:<br />1. The current relationship between Dennison and Aitkin is not known. A domestic disagreement may be the reason for hios activity today<br />2. Dennison has a prevcious history of drug abuse. There is no indication that she is not drug dependent at present which would impact on the successful negotiation with Aitkin.<br />3.

'1','5142','Yes<br />Goal -The safety of the children and the Deputy Head is of paramount importance and is the overall startegic objective'
'1','5145','I am aware that he entred the school at approximately 309pm and is known to have led the headmistress to the classroom by force. I was notified of the incident at approximately 4.30pm At 5.30pm the suspect has made telephone contcat to indicate that he wishes to speak with Sky news within the hour or he will start shooting children.'
'1','5139','My decision is not to let him speak to Sky News at this time:<br />The reason my decsion will achieve the goal is that:<br />1. It may prompt male to act as a martyr.<br />2. It may further agitate the subject.<br />3. I do not have avaialble resources to safely implement this request at this time<br />4. It will distract the subject form having dialogue with us'
'1','5138','A - Will not allow him to speak to Sky at this time'
'1','5141','Information as per the scenario that that male has entered Oakwood School believed to have taken the head teacher hostage abd entered Class 4Y containing pupils. K A call has been recieved from the subject believed to be Barry Atkin 33years
'1','5142','The hostage taker has made a demand and reinforced this demand
'1','5146','Action -<br />I have decided I will not allow Barry Aitkin to speak to sky news at this time.<br />I&#039;m going to negotiate with Barry to secure the safe release.'
'1','5145','Goal:- My goal is to preserve life and ensure that this siege situation is brought to a successful conclusion without loss of life or injury to any persons. Giving die consideration to the request of the suspect I have to consider if his demands are appropriate.'
'1','5138','Rational - it may put the hostages at greater risk by allowing him a media to have a public execution.<br />Rational - I want negotiation leverage'
'1','5141','Unknown at this time is at to why this is happening; numbers of pupils; intel on Atkin and associates. Resoucre levels are not known and the time is now 5.30pm.Clearly offences have been commited&gt;'
'1','5139','5. May prompt subject to harm the children whilst on air<br />6. May cause copycat incidents / additional prob
'1','5138','A - further actions - negotiator to buy me some time and build rapport with subject.<br />A - inteeligence package on believed offender ( however the identity needs to be firmed up)'
'1','5142','The reason and rational behind this decision is;<br />This approach complies with the goals of this operation.<br />The subject will be given the opportunity to speak with Sky news.<br />If the subject is not given access to Sky news there is an honest belief he may start shooting his hostages i.e the children'
'1','5137','A - Arrange for Sky news to attend. R -This is at this time a contingency. I will have them make their way to the scene. I Will also inform other news agencies. The reason for me taking this decision is that they will find out anyway and will attend in due course if not already on the way. I know that they will send 3 response crews. 1 to the scene
'1','5146','Reason -<br />I wish to retain some control of the incident to improve the likelyhood of a successful outcome.<br />I cannot control all variables and may have to use decisive Force or entry to secure my objectives<br />I don&#039;t wish to allow the opportunity for public exection or encourage copy cat incidents'
'1','5140','Reason: The subject of this incident has telephoned the police and has given a highly aggressive account of how he feels that muslim people are being specially treated. He is clearly (based on the call recorded into the police) extremely passionate about his cause and wants the world to know about it. He has made this demand and it is my view that if we give in to this demand at this stage then it is unlikely to result in the incident being resolved.'
'1','5143','Action -<br />I have decided that subject cannot speak to Sky news at this stage.<br />Reason -<br />Negotiations ongoing as per tactical plan. This is in a controlled and planned basis undertaken by Negotiation Cell.<br />Dynamic -<br />I will continue with my decision'
'1','5139','I am sticking to that unless:<br />1. Male makes his own contact with Sky news'
'1','5144','Action<br />Just in relation to the question around allowing atendence of sky news -<br />I have decided not to allow attendence of sky news<br />Reason  as this wil give the subject an audience and raise tension<br />as yet I have no negotiator advice  which is being sought<br />The allowing of such an audience will not significantly mitigate the risk to those at risk<br />The action that is being taken in line with the SFC strategy is...........<br />The tactical parameter are ........'
'1','5145','Action:- I will facilitate the subject access to a Sky News reporter under strict conditions. I am aware in his conversation that he was showing signs of distress. This is a critical stage and this access is appropriate'
'1','5140','This is not going to be the solution to his grieveance and will not acheive the strategy but rather will reinforce his position ofd strength and likely to result id further and greater demands.'
'1','5141','Goal Save Life;Maximise safety of the occupants of the school; Minimise rishk to police officers;Maintain cordons;Develop intelligence; Develop CIA; Media Strategy; return to normality - public confidence. Tactical Parameters - No oficers to enter premises unless consultation with SFC'
'1','5141','Action: igation.end to be placed on standby as this may assit investI have decided that Sky News att'
'1','5145','Reason:- Appropriate as a means of negotiating'
'1','5141','Landscape - Dennison has asked that Police use her as a 3rd party.K It is unknown how credible her interaction would be and that this could put her in danger and inflame the situation.'
'1','5137','G - my goal remains the same.<br />A - have trained negotiator speak with Charlotte to assess her as a TPI. this is in line with natioanal guidance and its important for me to understand her capabilty and for me to take an informed decision.'
'1','5138','My goals remain the same - safe release of hostages being primary objective.'
'1','5141','Goal As previous entry overarching save life'
'1','5145','Goal:- Me goal remain the same. To facilitate the safe return of the children to their families without injury of loss of life using tactical options available to me at the time.'
'1','5140','Goal: As stated previously.<br />Action: I do not intend to use the girlfriend as a TPI.<br />Reason: Whilst the use of third party intermediaries is a tactic used by trained negotiators it is a notoriously difficult tactic. The girlfriend has previously been used successfully in this way but that was when she was clean of drugs.'
'1','5146','Aitkin is Aspergers F  Condition has significant communication issues F Girlfriend has previous evience of helpful interaction F Girlfriend may now be taking cocaine Ass - Sounded cohesive on phone ass'
'1','5146','Goal/Objective - Not changed'
'1','5141','Action Continue with previous actions however Dennison is not to be used as a 3rd party.'
'1','5142','The goal remains the same<br />Action We will allow her to speak with him under controlled circumstances
'1','5139','What I want to acheive is;<br />1. Safety of children /school staff<br />2. Public safety<br />3. Max safety of officer sinvolved<br />4. Min risk to subject<br />Action: I will allow girlfirend to speak to him (by phone but not physically meet).<br />The reason my decsion will achieve the goals are:<br />1. She has previously assited Police in de-escalating a volatile situation<br />2. Aitkins is very agitated and hostile towards the Police<br />3. She apprears to ber lucid and coherent on the phone despite inteeligence that she has recently been using drugs. She may also possibly be able to give information on his drugs usage'
'1','5137','Dynamic - she is credible and can offer assistance - yes have her talk to him. Assessed as no - it doesn&#039;t happen.'
'1','5145','Action:- I am aware that the girlfriend of the suspect has successfuly negotiated with him in the past during a police incident. This option is available to me now and will use her under strict conditions and working alongside the negotiator.'
'1','5140','I am concerned
'1','5146','Action-<br />I have decided to allow Aitkin to talk to his girlfriend<br />I am going to facilitate this in a controled manner with briefing and debriefing for her'
'1','5137','I will at this time go with the assumption as YES.'
'1','5137','R - She has helped in the past and it will help achieve my goal'
'1','5146','Reason - This will offer the best chance of calming Aitkin to allow a peaceful resolution to achieve my goals'
'1','5142','Effective communication via TPI will assist in resolving the incident and achieving our goals.<br />I am sticking with this unless I receive an immiedate threat to life within the buildng in which case I will authorise firearms contigencies'
'1','5139','I am sticking with this decision unless:<br />1. The girlfriend appears to be under the influence of drugs<br />2. Her intervention appears to make Aitkins more agitated /he is refusing to speak to her<br />3. Girlfreind refuses to co-operate with the Police and converse with him along agreed guidleines'
'1','5144','landscape<br />info recieved from Charlotte that she could assist by speakng wih him<br />info from PC that at a demo the use of Charlotte as an TPI was positive<br />Goal as per previous<br />Action<br />Not to allow to speak<br />Reason<br />Goals remain the same
'1','5141','Reason - The mental state of Dennison is unknown and her prescence could put her life in danger.At this time she. may inflame the situation and make the situation worse. The subject has not requested to speak with her and her.'
'1','5146','Dynamic -<br />Unless Charlotte is exhibiting drug related behaviour or is viewed as a sig risk after briefing'
'1','5145','Reason:- Information has been received that the tactical option of using the girlfriend in the negotation stage has previously been a success. Whilst there is current intelligence indicating that she is currently taking controlled drugs I have no information or intelligence to suggest that she is not suitable under strict guidelines to perform the role.'
'1','5141','Dynamic - Review intelligence on Dennison - gleam further information and keep her as an intelligence source and liaise with Neg as to possible use.'
'1','5140','Dynamic: It would consider changing this tactic if negotiations would deteriorate to such a state that using a TPI was considered a risk worth considering.'
'1','5146','Alternative<br />Use of sniper if no other option available and risk increases'
'1','5138','Aitken has asperges and trusts his girlfriend and whilst she has returned to the use of drugs and prevents a risk
'1','5145','Dynamics:- I will stick to this tactic unless there is intelligence or information to indicate that this tactic will not serve the best interest of the victime.'
'1','5143','Goal - same as previous<br />Decision - Not to allow Charlette to speak to subject.<br />The reason for my decision is that:<br />1/. I am currently worked to a planned and agreed negotiation plan.<br />2/. I have considered the new intelligence that girlfriend
'1','5145','Alt:- Negotiator only'
